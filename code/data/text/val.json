        "video_sub_title": "now i've been diagnosed with aggressive b - cell lymphoma three times over the last eight years and one of them was stage four brain cancer so i can tell you from firsthand experience that for most cancers today it's just not as bad to have as you may think i don't want to be too cavalier about it because there are still cancers out there for which the outcomes are not great but oncologist today will tell you that most of their patients are now gonna make it they're going to survive and that's pretty good news because i gotta tell you the treatments are still grueling but it's a lot easier to go through them when the doctors are telling you they think you're going to be okay in the end and i have been through some very grueling treatments here's a picture of me with my son maxwell when i was going through my brain cancer i'm the one on your right funny thing about this picture is that i hated taking pictures when i was sick so the only reason i took this one is because i thought i was looking good that day now this cancer was a battle but i was still able to find a doctor who could say you know there's been some advances in the last couple of years and i think i got this i think you're gonna be okay and i was he was right to do it he gave me a lot of chemo obviously a lot of that was experimental i had a bone marrow transplant and they put this into my neck right here because i was able to use my own stem cells so they pulled my stem cells out and use those when it was time for the bone marrow transplant and i even had to have a hole drilled in my skull right here so that they could put a catheter into my brain and pour the chemo directly into the middle of it that one was a little crazy but it was more crazy when a few days later the doctors came in they put my scans up on the on the board and they were showing me where the memory centers of my brain were growing at this really accelerated rate and they just couldn't figure out why but last little bits not true but wouldn't it have been so cool when they put the chemo in my brain if it was turning me into a superhero now that would have made having cancer brain cancer completely worthwhile but unfortunately nothing happened not being a superhero was definitely the biggest disappointment that i had the whole time i had cancer now i show you these things that i went through for a couple of reasons one because well i happen to like sympathy and i think this makes me look very sympathetic you know that is by the way one of the silver linings in the cancer cloud you can get away with things when you have cancer that you could never get away with if you didn't and if i'm in the supermarket and there's a long line you know i've got cancer people just can't get out of the way fast enough to get me right to the front of the line so you know it's like a credit card a cancer card and everybody takes it it works all over the world you know so having cancer is not all bad it has its benefits too but i also want you to know that i have experience with all of this when i tell you that there are things that you can do to help a friend go through one of the most brutal parts about having cancer something that the doctor can't fix and that's the isolation the detachment from everyone everything that you know let me explain when you get sick like that you begin living this kind of parallel life separate from your regular life and all the people taking care of you the doctors the nurses your family people that your caregivers they're all helping you in this parallel life but there's nothing connecting you to your regular life and that's why i'm here today you all need to know that friends are the bridge that connects you to this regular life but unfortunately what happens is that after about the first month or two most cancer patients will tell you that people were great for a while but then they disappear and it's hard to figure out why and in my case i realized it could have been me look at me i'm adorable oh no what what really happens but it really happens is that your lives aren't passing together anymore you're doing different things obviously in people's lives go on but it's also because people get scared they get scared of the illness and they also just don't know what to do to help you but it actually is a terrible thing when you feel like you've been forgotten about because what happens is is the more time you spend away from everybody that's your friend this parallel life that your receding into grows and longer and longer distance away from this real life the regular life that you're used to and then you get better and you're left to try to connect the bridge all the way back to your regular life all by yourself and that is a long exhausting process it takes months years and some people that i've talked to say that they really never got back and it doesn't have to be like that because there are a lot of things that you really can do that are small that will make a very big difference in someone's life when they've got to wonder stick like this so i'm gonna talk about some of those but first i want to help you deal with how to act around somebody when they first learned that they've got cancer because everyone handles that very different emotionally you know you don't have to act all dark and gloomy at least not in my case i'd been feeling lousy for so long that i was more relieved than anything else that they had finally found something so when they told me i had cancer i was like well that's great i'm not going crazy it is something so but you know not everyone's gonna feel that way so you can't go into the room with them and say congratulations you must be thrilled that you've got cancer you know you can do what you want to do is you go in there you just say hey how are you feeling about your diagnosis because the way that they act with that question the way that they respond their words their mannerisms that's gonna lead you into directly how you should act what you should say what you should be doing next now here's what most people did or said to me when they wanted to help me when i first got sick if i can do anything please let me know well the first tip i want to give you all is that this is not helpful because all this does is give a sick overwhelmed person one more thing to do find something for you to do and if you don't then all of a sudden they're gone thinking well you know i tried but they didn't want any help and you multiply that times the dozens of people that are also saying the same thing to you and it becomes pretty clear early on but there's no help coming so instead let's just change a few words around here let's figure out and say you know i can do something i'm gonna figure out how to help you i'll be back i'll let you know what i can do what are some of those things so you can make good on that commitment well one thing is you can just text them regularly that's really easy and it can be impersonal i know it sounds like it if you send just one but if you send a bunch of them over time once a week even just once a month they do become meaningful all you got to do is say hey i want you to know i'm thinking about you that's it it can even be the same message every time but keep sending them even if they're not replying to you especially if they're not replying to you it will make a difference it's such an easy thing to do and at a minimum just do this because when i was holed up in a room and a message like that came across my phone it made me feel less alone and more connected even if it was just for a little bit give them a handwritten note not a hallmark get well card with a signature on it really write them a note a real letter and if you keep it consider taking a bunch of stationery when you see them and have them write some notes out to people themselves thank - you notes or just things that are just to reach out to friends that will keep them connected in a much different way on a number of levels visit as much as you possibly can i know this one seems obvious but i got to tell you the meaning of these these have changed a lot in the last 10 or 15 years because just that long ago the visit was to say goodbye to your friend but today it's about keeping them connected to the world that they're gonna be joining you back in pretty soon so the more you can visit the better off now when you ask them don't say hey when's a good time for me to come by that's a little like if i can do any if i can do anything let me know it's too big a question just say i want to come by tuesday at 6 p. m. is that alright that's a question that they can answer if you want to bring something it's not can i bring you anything same problem it's hey i'm bringing you a pizza or in an out burger is there anything you don't want on it that is a question again easy to answer when they're not up for a visit which is possible and it happens often they're just not feeling after seeing anybody you can still help because you can just say to them i'm gonna bring dinner to your house i'm gonna leave it at your front door at 6 o'clock so if you go out there at 6 : 05 it's gonna be there and you want to talk to anybody no pressure at all that's a friend that's getting it that's a friend that's thinking about them that's help and that's connectivity all right now when you visit this person there's a good chance they'll be sleeping don't leave because when you're sick you don't really sleep the same way you more like drift in and out every few hours so instead grab a book sit down next to them and wait for them to see if they wake up i'll tell you that most the time when you wake up over and over and over again you're alone with the reality or situation so to wake up and have a friendly friend there right in front of you makes a very big difference it's so uplifting it happened to me twice only in all these years and it was very uplifting so wait as long as you can if that's the case cancer is not contagious but it can feel like it when you're sick like that because nobody wants to touch you they stay on the other side of the room i'm telling you right now that if someone's got cancer it's okay to touch them you can't take your hand and just put it on their arm for a moment or two they don't get that a lot and that contact is very important and it will stay with them for a lot longer than just your visit create an online game night once a month say the third thursday of every month and this is an opportunity if you organize it for them for them to have something on the calendar to look forward to every month where they're gonna get to hang out with all their friends a lot of them at least and everybody can join in because all they got to do is sign on or get on facetime or skype easy to do help them get caught up one of the problems even though you're lying around you don't feel like doing your text messages emails you don't feel like going through your regular mail your social media so if you can just help them when you're sitting down with them get their phone and reply to stuff for them engage them get them caught up that's about as close as they're gonna get to feeling like they're back in their regular life if you can do that really important create a spotify playlist another nice thing to do you know call it cancer time or something and you put it you know their music that they'll like and their podcasts and some audiobooks things that they'll want to listen to and keep it current add things to it from time to time so they'll feel like they're staying up - to - date like everyone else is finally it's okay to tell them how you feel we don't live thankfully in the day and age anymore where a father shakes his son's hand as he goes off to war we can do better than that and i'll tell you when i had a friend that said hey i want you to know i love you buddy it mattered to me because it made me feel like i mattered and that made a difference look these are just a couple of ideas here that i that i came up with but i'll tell you something you know this person vest and so if they like guacamole well get some avocados and make him some but it's gonna take some initiative and some work on your part to be a friend when someone really need you like this everyone here if they don't already is going to know somebody soon that has cancer and they're going to get better in all likelihood whatever you do don't abandon them be that bridge that keeps them connected to their regular life be their friend thank you [ applause ]",

        "video_sub_title": "hi guys it's cassie with harlow's earth and today we're going to be doing a continuation video on molluscum contagiosum [ music ] so likely if you're watching this you have it or your little one does and you know how annoying it already is and you just want to make it better so what i have found that works best is simple apple cider vinegar now two of my kids have had it in the past and the first one i used both apple cider vinegar and tea tree oil with coconut oil so years later when my third baby got it we used just apple cider vinegar because the point was trying to dry them out because we really notice that once they're dry then they start healing really quickly so trying to dry them out is the best so we're going to use apple cider vinegar and water super simple so i just make myself a little jar like that and we want to dilute it because this stuff like directly on your skin i mean it's vinegar it it feels kind of stingy so if you're putting this on your little one i'd recommend you know going up to maybe a quarter of the way of apple cider vinegar and then the rest just filling it up with some straight up water it will be kind of a lovely little color and then you know if you're keeping it in here you will notice that that it starts to get a little bit cloudy as the mother's growing because if you have some apple cider vinegar you'll see that the mother's in here and it does it grows it's like a scoby it's amazing so what i say to this is after you've shaken it up take a nice cotton ball and try dipping it first on yourself so find a nice sensitive area like your wrist test it out does it feel stingy does it burn because your child's skin is more sensitive than yours so some people will put a band - aid on it to try to prevent further spreading you know maybe they have it on their arm or something like that but just be careful because band - aids can make the skin more sensitive if you're constantly peeling it off on and off on and off so um if possible just refrain from it and just try to let them dry out all on their own so you want to put some apple cider vinegar on a few times a day if you can if you can remember do it three times a day or at least in the morning and at night and you will see them start to dry out and that's what you're looking for the body's starting to respond it's starting to dry them out and then they quickly go away after that so good luck i hope this works for you let me know in the comments if you have any other great suggestions that have worked well for you for you dealing with molluscum or your little one or community here so we can all learn from one another we'll see you next time",

        "video_title": "UV Sterilizers for Reef Aquariums -How to Install-",
        "video_sub_title": "don't be a pig let's take hi this is george in this video i'll be talking all about uv sterilizers i'm going to go over everything including purchasing benefits installing you safety everything - everything uv sterilizers so be ready for a lot of information coming your way so first off why you need a uv sterilizer there are countless water problems that a new sterilizer may help you with common problems are ink green algae blooms and unclear water all of these have one thing in common bacterias many people try to solve these problems with liquid chemicals unless you have a perfect equilibrium of dosage it usually won't work if it doesn't work stop and just move on to and getting uv sterilizer even the best clean of aquariums can have aggressive allergy normal feeding biological filtration and inhabitant activity can easily continue to excessive algae nutrient levels also our aquariums are exposed to light on a daily basis both nutrients and encourage algae growth after all algae are in essence plants and all plants thrive on nutrients and life so what is uv sterilization it's actually a very simple process for removing unwanted free - floating bacterial and parasitic organisms out of your water bypassing the water through ultraviolet uv light the organisms die eradicating your aquarium water of these unwanted nuisances this results in clarification lower disease pathogens and improves redox your aquarium or popper a correctly installed and will design uv sterilizer can kill most suspended bacteria and many viruses in the water column while not affecting bacterial colonies in filter media and substrate let me explain the fiscal nature of a little bit more so pump pushes the water through uv sterilizer which is more like a tube i'll show you later a specific flow rate where the water will come in contact with the uvc light producing light either directly or indirectly via work sleeve the sleeve is a clear container sort of that the light does not obviously contact the water but the uv light then sterilize the water and it's returned to your tank will uv sterilizers effective water parameters yes and the use of the uv sterilizer will not directly affect the amounts of nitrates ammonia nitrites gh ph cage and so the use of vav sterilizer should not be considered either a positive or negative - all these parameters however a properly installed animal design uv sterilizer folder organics in the water column so this can indirectly affect kh levels as well the use of properly installed and will design uv sterilizers in order to directly affect redox balance we're reacting with the oxidants in your water column which turns the lower oxidizing stressors to fish right now all these set of facts may seem sort of complex but once i break down the uv sterilizer to show you how to install in a tank like my new globe 30 gallon you'll see it really isn't that complicated so then people ask will if it kills bacteria on organics what else does it kill you guys soon realizes will destroy parasites such as pink drink a newborn free - swimming life cycle of that bacteria but they don't heal or remove it parasites once attached to the fish so it's not going to get rid of your product it's just going to help keep you from developing this problem uv sterilizers however will simply just not kill your fish it is a very low chance by a uv sterilizer that it made stress a fish but that really should not have again a uv sterilizer can clear green water in aquarium or pond however if you are seasoning deadrock such as so - called live rock that was just imported you are using sterile ward calcium bit rock or air emissary it's best to turn off your uv for a few weeks after your tank finish cycling for a couple months however long it takes then it's perfectly set at uv sterilizer juices now the fun part body i see many in action in various things some hold together better than others but they're all basically doing the same thing it's all about the flow rate your tank needs and the watts are required units can range from $ 40 to hundreds of dollars some popular ones include the jbj nano zek the green killing machine core life worms and bio key worms i have the nanos app and that's what i'll show you installing but again it's all about what your tech needs do research unfortunately most websites that sell products like these have some book - reviews and many people are just putting short - term experiences with the product versus like long - term so you're not going to get the best reviews on a lot of sites but just do your best to research for what you need this is the jdj nanos app um this is what i have in this tank and now i'll break it down for you show you exactly like what you get box how to install it what it's like so you can really figure out whether your tank needs one of these alright guys so this is what we have we have the nanos app right here i'll do a little unboxing show you what's inside and then show you how to install it so when you take out all the pieces first of all it's just a lot of tubing you're going to need a lot of known tubing for your tank needs you just got some manuals warranty all that nice stuff and that's pretty much a then you have because i've already tamed out and use it the uv sterilizer um it's got a bunch of safety things and while we're on the topic of safety i'd like to talk about safety so uv sterilizers can be damaging the light to the human eyes so don't look directly into the bulb ever always unplug your unit one when working on it to prevent possible shock if it breaks and gets wet an inline uv sterilizer is best this should be installed after your filter as the less particles your uv has to get through the better results you will have also installing your uv after your filters allows the filters to have the best possible bio filtration let's talk about the design of the uv sterilizer so this opens up you spin it and you can clearly now see the quartz leave so the water is going through this ring through the unit going back out while it hits the uv light which can be very bright that's called the quartz leave that is totally secure but the problem is when you're using these you need to be very very careful because many of the different aspects of the uv sterilizer break so when you turn it back on you have to do it very slowly when you twist this back on just to do it very slowly everything is very delicate about the unit make sure you securely tighten everything you don't want to have leaks this is my secret pump and what you do is you take the tubing connect that to the bottom of the uv sterilizer and this is the outlet back into my water and you put that at the top go ahead make sure it's tight that's like i said very important you don't want to have leaks here here so another question is what influences the effectiveness of a uv sterilizer number one wattage research what your tank needs the watts this uses and the watts you this uses are different the watts my tank uses are different it all has to be neutral and in sync number two contact time the longer it takes for the water to pass the bull the greater the contact time so for this reason for long either you sterilize your bulb the better also this is a good reason not to use a pump that that's more powerful than recommended the water will pass the uv sterilizer too quickly to maximize the effectiveness of the radiation make sure you know what pump you're using because if the water is going too fast it's not going to work it's not going to be effective it needs to have a good flow rate that really maximizes its potential number three the age of the bulb the uv sterilizer bulbs need to be replaced every six months it will look like there is enough light but it isn't the strongest possible quartz leaves will not allow it to pass through even though you can see it when it is dimmer it will look significantly different but this is the case you purchase a replacement bulb replacement bulbs are wow they're expensive and so you don't want to break the bulbs every one changing them like i said you need to be very careful that leads us to number four light blockage the uv sterilizer bulbs are containing the quartz leaves and the slaves what we need to clean periodically to prevent like blockage so you don't have to like to be too low but you also don't want it to be very high and it's being blocked that's not good cleanliness of the water going into the uv sterilizer you may need to clean your uv sterilizer more or less often than someone else so specifically the outside of the quartz tube the that is where the bulb is set and that's what needs to be cleaned basically if the uv light from the bulb can't penetrate the sleeve then it won't reach the water that flows around the core sleeve this should become very easy to maintain though um you're just you know scrubbing and doing that kind of stuff the actual bulb is cause you like i said so be careful when handling that um and the quartz sleeve is made of glass so if you drop it even an inch it's probably going to break be careful i've done this so many times where i drop something and this falls and then the next thing falls and it's just a really bad cycle so after you have this all set up make sure it's secure i'll show you how you're going to put it into the tank this is the middle column these are the filter pad chambers with my protein skimmer my filter media and it goes right in the dead center you don't want it too early in the cycle that will be bad for the growing bacteria so with my nouveau this pumped is a little bit hard placed into this small slit there you go and just be careful when gentling putting it down in your tank they are connected together so you need to kind of sync up the wires put right in like that make sure there are it's tightly fit and something that's a very good idea is with this extra piece of equipment this comes out all the time so take a nice clip put it on there let me go back down and we can turn on the tank again now you have to add please the sterilizer and the pump so now should be there goes the water it's going down down now now now now now you just want to give it a good look make sure doesn't have any leaks these sterilizers are very simple piece of equipment that most employers should have i hope this video will help educate you guys why you might need one and what having one is like if any questions at all let me know and any recommendations for new videos i'd love to hear message me let me know thanks for your time tour check out some vip let's take",

        "video_title": "Piriformis Syndrome Treatment- STOP Stretching!",
        "video_sub_title": "everyone dr. charlie johnson physical therapist back pain specialist if you're watching this video you've probably taken my my piriformis self - test so where i gave you basically three self movement tests you could determine whether or not piriformis syndrome is actually the cause of your buttock pain and / or sciatica leg pain numbness tingling whatever it may be alright so if you watch that and you said okay charlie like i have i have piriformis syndrome what do i do about it i'm and / or you've been trying your ownself treatments likely you've been trying to stretch it out by pulling the hip over and across the opposite shoulder feeling a good pool on the buttock maybe even stretching out your hamstrings whatever it is it's just not working well then this is for you so consider this this is a muscle to rubber band all right consider this is the piriformis muscle so you have a point a and point b right well lengthening it right would be stretching the muscles so that's how most people approach treatment of piriformis syndrome is that they try to stretch it out or make it longer because it feels tight well i'll be the first to say that if you've gone through my self tests and piriformis syndrome seems to be the likely cause of your buttock pain leg pain numbness or tingling then understand that most of the time the muscle actually needs to be shortened alright so i can't tell you how many times i see people with piriformis syndrome who just continue to stretch out their piriformis so they try to improve the flexibility or the length of the piriformis muscle when in actuality the answer is that they need to make it shorter right so they need to you know just understand this how do you lengthen a muscle you stretch it right you take point a to point b further apart makes sense how do you shorten the muscle so just think about that so you shorten a muscle by contracting it so when you lengthen a muscle where you stretch it right you pull the properties within the muscle sort of further apart all right when you contract it right and you get that little bump or that little contraction you actually shorten the muscle the the elements within the muscle kind of grab onto one another and they overlap more so by shortening the muscle or repeatedly contracting it and strengthening it in a shortened position you can often relieve pressure in tension through the piriformis muscle so consider that many people appear a foreman syndrome actually have a muscle that's on straining it's annoyed because it's too long and you keep stretching it is it possible i could be right or wrong you give it a try but is it possible that by shortening it and taking some of the tension off of that right so now you're taking a muscle it's long and sort of can't function very well and now you're making it nice and stiff and short such that it can actually have the ability contract and do the work that it needs to do again test it out but i'm going to show you a few ways to do that now so first things first is that you need to actually determine should you be stretching it or should you not be stretching it and here's how you can kind of tell so just do this self - test let's just say that you have your left buttock and leg is fine you were right one is where you have symptoms all right so let's test the good leg first so go ahead and just cross it up here and push the hip down so this motion right is kind of assessing the length of the piriformis so you're going to kind of see what motion you have there you can see from the camera right from like a straight down angle i don't know i've got 70 degrees something like that of rotation in the hip right now do the other side if this side is the one where you have a piriformis syndrome and you have the same exact amount of motion so mine are pretty symmetrical right i have about 7080 degrees of rotation on this side well if you have the same motion in the hip and you're thinking that piriformis is tight on one side that just can't be really possible and it doesn't really make sense because if the hips move exactly the same and stretching the hips and making them kind of move better as the answer well number one why hasn't it work and number two why don't you have it on the other side which moves exactly the same as the side where you do have pain right hopefully it makes sense so now so what i would say is that often i see people have obsessive hip motions so these people start here and they push down and they i can't go that far but they can get their knee all the way down to the table so they have a lot of rotation in the hip and a lot of these people sit with their leg crossed so they're habitually lengthening this piriformis muscle and they go to yoga they go to they watch youtube and they just try to lengthen the heck out of this thing when in fact they should be doing the opposite stop crossing your legs during work and actually strengthen it all right so point is if you have excessive motion on both hips then you definitely don't need to stretch it if it's the same you probably don't need to stretch it and here is when you you could perhaps benefit from stretching it so again if this is the good leg and you put it up and you've got great motion here it moves really well alright and again you've got i don't know 70 80 degrees there right and then you go to this hip it's like you just can't quite get it on up and it's very stiff and the knee won't go down and won't kind of come up it's just super stiff and it's clearly different then yeah that might be a reason that you might want to go ahead and try to stretch it to try to make it symmetrical but if it's symmetrical and especially if it's excessive like you can get your knee you know kind of like parallel or inline with your foot or you can get it all the way down to the table please don't stretch the hip anymore instead try these two things okay so if you've been trying to stretch a heck out of your hip and it's not helping your piriformis syndrome try these two things okay so the first way you're going to do is a really simple exercise as far as like set up but you actually find probably if this is something you need to be doing it might be quite challenging so you're going to lay on your side so that the leg that hurts or the buttock that's bothering you is up alright notice my knees are bent my feet are together and rested on the my heels are together okay just fine like a natural position your knees shouldn't be a really high that shouldn't be in line if you could should just be slightly out front with the heels together hands on hip here you're going to just rotate upwards as far as you can now what i don't want you doing is rotating upwards and rotating your whole body alright your hand is here such that as soon as you feel this start to rock backwards you stop so if you have good hip motion it should look something like this alright and what you're going to feel if you're doing this correctly and you're keeping your heels together is you're going to be able to squeeze kind of in the upper outer hip area all right now to get used to the motion start with just maybe 15 to 20 reps maybe that's stage one alright so you do this every day once in the morning once at night and you go for fifteen twenty heck even thirty reps you just get you know you just get the motion of the exercise you learn what the form should be like you get to find like that tipping point and you really get the quality of the movement down right and then once that gets easier the goal is that you shorten the muscle actually bring it closer together okay and you hold it there so you hold it in a shortened position alright so what you would do is you would hold your hip here i'm getting this end range position just before you start to rock backwards alright and hold it there and you would hold that there for up to a minute and then after that minute you can go to the other side hold it for a minute and you can hold it for a minute up to three times on that side where you really feel a burn and a lot of work in the hip area okay so starting with repetitions to get the quality of the motion and then going for one minute a three one - minute holds at that tipping point okay so that's the first one alright the second one is is a bridge with hip rotation alright so if you have a band great if not just use like a bigger belt that you have or loop a couple belts together and you're just going to put it around just above the knee so again you can take a belt and kind of loop it you know cinch it up there okay so you're gonna do is you're gonna be on your back just like in this position not too far out that'll work your hamstrings not too close just kind of find a comfortable position knees about about shoulder - width apart maybe a little bit more narrow and what you're going to do is you're going to lift up and then at the top you're going to push out gently against the band you're not going all the way out as far as you can you're just pushing out a little bit until you feel tension in the back part let your back side and you know your outer hips and again you can if you want to go for repetitions lift and help down lift it out or you can go for hold so you can hold this position for again up to a minute three times and you'll feel good work a good workout in the buttocks and the outer hip so with that being said try those two exercises if you notice that you have really good in symmetrical motion on either side of your hips and you've been trying to stretch your piriformis and it just hasn't been working i'm instead consider that instead of more length maybe it needs to be shortened so you do that through strengthening and contraction so i hope this helps leave comments below",

        "video_title": "Cephalexin",
        "video_sub_title": "hello i'm dr. ken lambda thanks for watching let's talk about keflex or cefalexin this is an antibiotic that was discovered in 1967 first marketed in 1969 so it's pretty old it's now available as that generic it's on the world health organization list of essential medicines fifth most commonly prescribed antibiotic in the united states and 107th most prescribed drug it seems that it's the most popular of all of the cephalosporins in australia it's among the top 15 prescribed medicines but you have to remember as an antibiotic it frequently is prescribed for improper reasons estimated somewhere between 40 and 60 percent of antibiotics are not for appropriate indications it's not for a viral infection it's certainly not for a common cold not for just the run - of - the - mill sore throat it kills certain gram - positive bacteria those are bacteria like staph and strep so it's good for strep pneumoniae and staph epidermidis and the group a beta hemolytic streptococcus is 10 staff or the mrs a you've heard so much about and it also seems to kill some of the gram - negative bacteria like e - coli or proteus mirabilis or klebsiella pneumoniae cephalosporin is big family of antibiotics and the cefalexin are keflex is considered a first generation drug now there have been second and third and fourth and even fifth generation drugs they have different kind of spectrum of activity but the first generation cephalosporins like cefalexin they have an activity similar to the beta - lactam antibiotics that means penicillin basically so it's bacteria sidle against a large number of organisms that kills the bacteria some antibiotics just wing the bacteria or temporarily stop them from growing here in the case of cephalexin it actually kills the organisms but it's inactive against the wide array of bacteria so it doesn't work against the interrupts against the bacteria that don't require oxygen doesn't work against the fungi doesn't work against the viruses and the way it works is it prevents the cell wall from being replicated well what's it good for that's good for a lot of cases of otitis media middle ear infections skin and soft - tissue infections so cellulitis and abscesses can be used for certain forms of acne can be used in pregnant women and breastfeeding women can be used for respiratory infections like strep throat even certain forms of pneumonia it can be used to prevent bacterial infection of the heart valves after you go and see the dentist maybe not necessarily the first choice but it certainly is one of the approved drugs that we use it's good for certain backbone and joint infections even for certain urinary tract infections even for prevention of urinary tract infections but you only take cephalexin if you highly suspect that you have a bacterial cause for whatever your problem is and that the bacteria is susceptible and knowing whether the bacteria is susceptible requires some sort of knowledge of where you happen to get your infection because in certain locales there's a high incidence of resistance on there locales well it's much lower so have to know that kind of information for certain kinds of infections it's even important to get a culture and sensitivity takes about 48 hours to get the answer from that and then depending on what the outcome is maybe the antibiotic needs to be changed the good news about cefalexin is it doesn't interact with drug metabolizing enzymes in the liver so that means it has fewer krauss reactions than with other drugs that we take get higher blood levels after using the cefalexin compared to most of the other antibiotics and the other good news is only about 10 % of the antibiotic is bound to the proteins well that that 90 % is free and active in the system so the more the binding is to the protein the lower their action is so here we have some good news on two fronts what's available in capsules and tablets even an oral suspension comes in 250 milligrams 500 program those are the standards also comes in 333 and 750 milligram and the way it works is it prevents something known as peptic like pain from forming a stable cell wall so that as the bacteria starts to grow it sort of bulges out the cell wall and then let some of the tissue fluid in that bursts the bacteria so that's pretty good news so effectively it puts holes in the cell wall of the bacteria that's the way it kills it well what's the likelihood of an allergy you talk about it in two meiotic allergies is there much in the way of allergy the cefalexin no not really it's very low but actually more of a problem is that somewhere between 1 and 10 percent of people who are penicillin allergic can have an adverse reaction to cefalexin probably the number is closer to 1 2 or even 3 percent it's not an issue with the 2nd and the 3rd and the 4th generation cephalosporins but it is with the first generations so if a person has a mild - maybe even a moderate penicillin allergy it's probably okay for the most part to use it because most people actually think they're allergic to penicillin really aren't but if you have a severe reaction to penicillin then cefalexin is not an appropriate substitute well if you have an allergy to the cephalosporin family then again probably shouldn't take it what about the side effects are they common no actually they're not very common overall probably about 3 percent of people have some sort of drug related adverse reaction we look at gastrointestinal problems like diarrhea nausea and vomiting and dyspepsia or gi upset all less than a bad one or at most two percent abdominal cramps relative uncommon again less than 1 % 1 % or a fewer people going to suffer from anemia or rash or or to carry or headache but some women might develop a vaginitis or genital yeast infection even a genital itch from overgrowth of other bacteria sometimes it can lead to an unpleasant taste in the mouth and it happens to come in a relatively large capsule so some people might find it difficult to swallow now we know that cipro and that family tends to cause some problems with the tendon and so to cefalexin may rarely cause a problem with the tendons it can increase the number of eosinophils those are the allergy cells and sometimes on rare occasion when people take the medicine then they have an increase in some of the liver enzymes that we find in the bloodstream on prolonged use of the drug we can have overgrowth of bacteria that aren't susceptible to the antibiotic we call that a super infection well one of the worst problems that we have nowadays with the antibiotics is a problem with c difficile clostridium difficile it's a bacteria and it's possible to get growth of this particular organism in the intestine when you take any antibiotic it can happen with catholics or cefalexin but it's not all that common but it's an important one to realize and it can occur during treatment or even up to about two months after you discontinued the drug it has a wide range of symptoms from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis the diagnosis needs to be considered and anybody who takes an antibiotic and then develops and diarrhea or symptoms of colitis or toxic megacolon or even has a perforated colon cephalexin alters the bacteria that are present in the intestine obviously it kills bacteria wherever they are and sometimes that leads an opening so that the clostridium difficile that might already be there starts to grow and as it grows it makes certain kind of toxins toxin a and b and they contribute to we now call clostridium difficile associated disease and that can be refractory to antibiotics to other antibiotics so here we have a potential life - threatening disease so what do we do well early on if it's just a mild diarrhea to stop the antibiotic if it's a moderate diarrhea then you need some support you need some fluid and electrolytes and protein supplements and you need antibiotics directed specifically against the clostridium difficile however if it's a really severe problem that's when they do those fecal transplants could you overdose on the medicine sure but doesn't usually cause much problem typically you're going to develop some nausea or vomiting or epigastric distress maybe even a little bit of diarrhea otherwise if you take it and you have other kind of symptoms probably it's due to underlying disease state or maybe even an allergy or sometimes a toxicity from other kind of medicine rarely ever does it need any kind of treatment pregnancy by itself doesn't appear to cause any specific issues with cephalexin or catholics breastfeeding again appears relatively safe there's no alteration in fertility you have to be a little bit cautious as renal function deteriorates either because of disease or over the course of a lifetime as your what we call glomerular filtration rate which normally should sit in the average young person over 90 well in the person about 65 it might be 60 well when it gets down to about 30 we have to restrict the amount of cephalexin we use you could have a possible false positive test for glucose in the older tests that aren't used anymore but not with the test tape that we use frequently with the drug the total amount absorbed same in with food or without food but you get a higher peak blood concentration if you take it without food now it's going to go through the kidneys and it's going to go through the filtration mechanism of the kidney and that means it's going to have the peak concentration in the urine so if we use just a 250 milligrams capsule of cephalexin of keflex we're going to have a thousand micrograms per milliliter in the urine now compare that to just nine to thirty - two micrograms per milliliter in the blood and you can see that we really concentrate the medicine in the urinary tract so it's good for urinary tract infections whether they're kidney infections or bladder infections that's why it's a really good choice even when the drug might not seem to be appropriate because of supposed resistance often times it works just because it's a massive quantity what the drugs well absorbed the peak concentrations within about an hour protein binding that's only about ten percent it's not metabolized or inactivated by the body the elimination half - life is about an hour but it can be increased to somewhere between eight and 14 hours in people who have renal failure 80 % of the medicines going to be excreted within about six hours after you take it and what should you take o depends on what kind of condition you have but the typical dose would be about a gram a day and divided doses maybe take it two times a day or three or even four times a day it could be increased if necessary to two grams even up to four grams if you need more than four grams then you should consider either a different antibiotic or the drug needs to be administered parentally by shot children well they take the dose based on how much they weigh the maximum peak blood concentration you're going to get it if you take the drug on an empty stomach but it's acid stable in the stomach but food in the stomach delays the peak delays the onset of action and prolongs the blood level actually you're going to get about 10 % less excreted in the urine if you take it with food rather than if you take it fasting and if you're taking with you for a urinary tract infection obviously you want the highest concentration you can get in the urine well the renal excretion of the drug is going to be slowed down if you take another medicine called probenecid probenecid used for gout typically so if you're taking the medicine then you got to be a little bit careful of combining the two it also increases the blood concentration of cephalexin alcohol is going to decrease the absorption from the intestine if you take it with metformin very commonly used it's going to increase the concentration of metformin in the system by about 30 % if you take it with the drug like cimetidine or ranitidine it can decrease the absorption of cephalexin so you get lower blood levels it's beta - lactam antibiotics so we find that bacteria frequently make beta lactamase i'm going to make beta lactamase and in a fact breaks down the cephalexin cephalexin doesn't work and the bacteria also can make another kind of a substance that pumps the antibiotic out of the bacteria then obviously the bacteria this antibiotic doesn't work well the precursor to the cephalosporin family was something called cephalosporin c it was found from the fermentation of amorous cell ops this minimum that's a fungus originally it was called cephalosporin macro ammonium and it was discovered in 1945 in the sea near a sewage outlet off the coast of sardinia the structure of the antibiotic was elaborated in the early days 1953 to about 1961 it's sort of served as a starting point for a variety of semi synthetic compounds either first generation cephalosporins include doris effin and seth and seth adil and bella saif all in addition of course to catholics now it's similar in action to the amoxicillin and the penicillin family in general but unfortunately over time an increasing number of bacteria are becoming resistant to all of these antibiotics now as i mentioned we have the fourth generation and a fifth generation fifth generation has a novel spectrum of activity against those methicillin - resistant staph aureus how much does all of this cost well the good news is that generics cephalexin generic if not very inexpensive you can get 40 tablets of 500 milligrams if just pay cash it's only 31 dollars if you have a coupon it's between 10 and 20 dollars you get the coupon in free at good rx if you take the catholics the name - brand even though it's been around for a long time it's still gonna cost you more than 400 dollars if you pay cash and if you have a coupon it's gonna cost you about $ 370 so cephalexin it's the generic for keflex it's pretty good antibiotic good for minor bacterial infections for staph and strep and middle ear infection sometimes strep throat urinary tract infections relatively few side effects and low cost but because of the overuse of antibiotics and remember 40 to 60 percent of antibiotics that's probably a minimum or inappropriately used so now we have a condition where a lot of bacteria are becoming resistant to the effect and remember as with all antibiotics they're only good for susceptible bacterial infections they're not good for viruses or the common cold anyway thanks for watching if you enjoyed the show please tell a friend and consider subscribing so you'll be notified as we post new videos i appreciate your interest i'm dr. ken landau [ music ] [ music ] [ music ]",

        "video_title": "HAIR OIL ROUTINE | A WEEK IN MY HAIR",
        "video_sub_title": "hey so today i am going to take you through a week in my hair so i'm going to share everything from how i take care of it and how often do i wash it what's my oiling routine the products that i like to use how often do i use a clarifying shampoo and styling tips etc so everything that you can think of is going to be featured in this video the first question is how often do i wash my hair so that is something that i had to teach myself over the couple of years so i have she changed my hair not to get as oily as soon as possible it might sound strange to you guys but once you listen to it it might start to make sense so most of you might face this that your hair starts to get oily really soon right after you wash your hair a lot of my friends and then i get emails from you guys i also get a lot of facebook messages saying that you know your suggest a shampoo for me because my hair gets oily really soon as soon as i wash it ass wash my hair every second day the thing is the more often you wash your hair the oily it is going to get yes listen to me on this one so what you can do is train your hair so that it does not produce as much oil and it's used to so the more you wash your hair the more used to paint the natural oils off of your scalp once you wash your hair less frequently your scalp need not produce that much oil to replenish and rebalance the stripping is caused because of excessive shampooing okay second thing is that when you shampoo your hair you need not wash anything below your ears and you're basically supposed to clean your scalp so and make sure to use your fingers will either the shampoo and then start from a behind you of yours and then just go up like this so once do this leg tries and then go up like this twice and then go again on the back of your head and then massage your head and then just wash the scalp off and whatever is left of the lather you can just go ahead and just rub it against your like the rest of the head and the third thing is don't apply conditioner on your scalp or anywhere above yo - yos and washing your hair too frequently and the second thing is using conditioner above joy's yours these are the two factors that lead to your hair being greasy very quickly even if you shampooed it yesterday you don't need any special shampoo you just need to wash your hair properly wash it twice wash this cap twice and then go ahead and condition it well but that being said i'm going to share the shampoos that i like to use i was using the moroccan oil shampoo this is the moroccan oil conditioner and this is their shampoo so i thoroughly enjoyed using this and these two are almost empty using a new barrier shampoo and conditioner now these are both from macadamia natural oil range yeah the macadamia natural oil range this is the rejuvenating shampoo and this is their deep repair mask i'd really like the shampoo because it does not leave your hair greasy and it does not strip it off completely and it just cleans your hair really maxi this is followed by the gp bear mask the mask is extremely hydrating and it just locks in all the moisture i have to even conditioners that i use this is the moroccan oil and this is one of my absolute favorite i have talked about it a lot this is the more often oil treatment and i like to use this on wet or dry hair then i also like use the macadamia heating oil children as a leave - in conditioner once a week i like to use a clarifying shampoo and this is spam things lightly clean so it's a very ultra cleansing shampoo so it cleanses everything and i like to use this on the weekend especially if i've used a lot of products throughout the week so to remove the excess gunk and just strip my hair off of all the styling products and this is the one that i've been using for years now one of the styling products that i use is a bee or a flame hair x styling extreme volume mousse that's a mouthful but yeah i like to use this only on special occasions if i want too much volume on the crown of my head so i like to use it then otherwise i don't use it very often my styling products is my drill and let's satin hairspray and this is the hairspray that the only hairspray that i've used and i'd really really like this and i think it's really nice hairspray does not damage your hair too much as in it does not leave your hair feeling that thick and immovable if you know what i'm saying if your hair super soft and satiny and not feel get that whitish layer on your hair the third thing that i have as a styling product is my dry shampoo now this is a savior when it comes ends monument favorite hair products of all time and i wish we could find this in india but one of my friend got this for me right now my hair is super oily and the moment so what you do is just to shake this up real quick and then just you know move your hair up and life is great yeah and then rub it up like this so you just do that and it just absorbs all the excess oil and your hair feels like you just washed it i file if you're watching this so this part is for you because you requested this heavy oiling coconut oil regime so yeah here it is so what i like to do is take in two tablespoon of coconut oil and two tablespoon of olive oil mix it all together in mixing like any bowl any microbial cysts bowl and then microwave it for 30 seconds until it is warm to the touch so once that's done i have my oil here in a bowl and i like to take a cotton ball soaked it in with the oil remove any excess from my partition what i like to do is just jab the cotton ball so what this does is make sure that the oil goes directly onto my scalp i know this might sound a little you're too much work but um actually like once you all your scalp you can actually see the difference it really stimulates the roots and then your hair grows faster so i'm going to repeat the process again just tipping the pot in it with which i can't really see what i'm doing so i hope it's alright so what i like to do is just over my scalp and then just you know turn the hair inch by inch and then go ahead and oil the scalp once that's done once you've completely applied oil all over your scalp what i like to do is just stick in my fingers and gently massage my scalp a little bit to do to stick my finger beginning from my yours i like to go upwards like this taking a circular motion and then just do that i think like four five times and then what i like to do is just go from her to my center of my hand head and then just do this and i'll do that couple of times and then what i like to do is stitch it behind on my head and just repeat the same thing it's really really nice when somebody else does it for you i always fall asleep once that's done i like to apply whatever is remaining in the bowl on to the length of my hair so i'm just going to pour it on my hand like this and then just massage it a little bit and then just put it on to the lengths of my hair don't worry if you're going to get a little bit of hair fall by doing this because you are rubbing your hair so much it might cause some breakage but it's okay if it is not too much once i've applied oil all over my head what i like to do is something known as the turbine therapy and that does is really helps in the oil to get deep inside your hair and moisturize it from deep within what i like to do is take a towel and soak it in extremely hot water and squeeze out any of the excess as you squeeze all the water out or what i like to do is just turn my hair upside down like this and then take the top on and make sure it's it's too hot be careful so i'm going to put all my hair up in a turbine and keep it like the until the doll don't scold another tip that i wanted to give you guys was if you have oily skin don't keep your hair oily in your head for more than two hours actually not more than one odd if you have runny oily skin so what happens is that the oil seeps into your forehead and into your skin and then it attracts dust and then you can get breakouts because of that and also if you sleep overnight with your heroine that is disastrous don't do that i know it's a very popular practice here in india to sleep with hair oil in and just don't do that especially if you are very prone to acne and have a really oily skin don't do that try not to do that even if your grandma tells you to do that yeah so once that's in i like to use the shampoos that i just mentioned and then just wash my hair off so another thing that i wanted to mention is to keep my hair healthy i like to trim it very often so i trim it around or every two months or two and a half months cut to inch off of the length and just to make sure that all the dry ends and the split ends are all chopped off so that is a week in my hair i hope you found this video helpful if you try this out don't forget to send me a turban selfie i'd love to see that if you take it up with selfie just tag me on your instagram picture and i will go ahead and repost some of my favorites because i love going to instagram feeds and i think instagrams for my favorite social media and i think you guys should follow me there because i update it very regularly so i'll see you there and i'll see you in my next video very soon bye",

        "video_sub_title": "what we're going to go over now is proper brushing technique with an electric toothbrush what we traditionally see when patients come in before they've had braces is they brush in kind of a sweeping motion like this it's very common and by far the most prevalent brushing technique for kids what we're after with electric toothbrush is we're trying to actually slow down and brush each individual tooth one at a time we're going to give you an example here you turn the brush on what we're after is brushing putting the bristles down between the braces under the wire kind of sliding it down between each one and then taking the brush up from underneath and brushing that area between the bracket and the gum that's the critical area we're keeping the gums healthy and avoiding a lot of or any of the white marks that you might see after the braces come on we're going to show you this technique here a little bit on a patient come over here we're going to close just a little bit good what we're going to see here if we turn this on we're going to take the head of the brush and slide it underneath the wire between those back to teeth you'll notice i'm kind of going in and out with the toothbrush it allows me to see if that plaque is coming off the teeth when i go up there it was in and around like this then i take the duke brush and i brush that area between the brackets and the gums that is the area of the mouth that you see most of the problems and most of the plaque buildup so continue to take the brush underneath the wire around the brace right up here at the gum line and work your way around the mouth you'll notice the gums here are a little irritated we're seeing a little bit of bleeding but we've been doing a few takes on this and the gums are a little irritated continue to work the brush around getting the plaque off of the seat the most common area we see is right up here problems is between the brackets and the gums if the plaque is allowed to sit in that area the gums get puffy and inflamed and we see little white rings around the braces and we want to avoid all of that so that when we take your braces off the smile is healthy and you're happy with it",

        "video_sub_title": "prevent overfishing welcome to my master sky today i'll be showing you how to butterfly coil a rope it's very easy let me show you how it's done so first things first we're gonna need a rope hopefully it doesn't have any knots or tears or anything like that just a little more rope and we have it on the ground i'm gonna pick up one end it doesn't matter take one end and you make two on links sections so one two wherever i stop i'm gonna grab it with my left hand and bring it to my waist then i'm gonna go straight up and around my neck and then with the other side i'm a crisscross and keep that end and still holding then go straight up cross around straight up cross go straight up cross straight up cross straight up cross straight up cross and i'm gonna repeat this pattern until i'm almost done with a stroke so i'm not fast forward this okay so i promise even though it looks like a big mess there's a method to this so right now my two ends on the ground are about the same they're about two arms mix on the ground and what i'm gonna do is i'm a let go of the bottom and i'ma grab to one side on the other side and i'm gonna pull this apart you see how that worked that's why i was doing the crisscross now the next next step is you fold this in half very carefully and you take the the to let you end and this is very important that you keep them tight and then you loop it around the very top go ahead and make two good loops on top and make it tight once you've done that you're gonna basically have something like this you're gonna take these two pieces of rope and you're gonna fold it like so and you're gonna stick it through once you stick it through you're gonna have a loop like this and then with the other side of the rope you're gonna put it through and then you're gonna cinch it down okay so basically now a rope cannot get untangled as you guys can see now the awesome part about this is that you can backpack coil so you throw it in your back like so you crisscross go around your waist then it comes back out then you can tie a knot or a bow or whatever you want to do the way you don't have to carry an extra backpack to carry this rope because it'll be on your back already just like this so that's how you butterfly coil a rope now to simply to use it again you can take it off your body and you reverse the steps it's very important to when you do this don't just throw this whole thing on the ground spread it out like this and whenever you lay it down be very careful and see if you use the top you'll never have any kinks in this rope because whenever you need the rope you don't want any extra hiccups and that's how simple it is to use it and as always i hope you guys like this type of video go ahead and comment down below share this video subscribe if you haven't already and you guys know i'll enjoy seeing you guys next time talk apakah",

        "video_sub_title": "so you're at that point you're trying to decide okay i have low dopamine levels i get that but how can i actually increase them naturally without necessarily having to use a medication so we're gonna talk about that right after this intro how you doing my optimal mind today we're going to be talking about how can you increase your dopamine levels naturally now if you are somebody that has low dopamine levels because whether you're told because you have adhd whether you have depression anxiety or you have a trouble focusing or paying attention if you're in that kind of care category or you forget things and you can't remember things chances are that you can have low dopamine levels so we're going to talk about that but before we get started if you are new here and actually do have adhd and are trying to look for better ways to improve your adhd naturally well i also have a free guide in the description below basically goes over the labs that you should be running if you have hd what supplements and nutrients you can implement what foods to implement as well as what foods to avoid all that is in the description below for adults with hd as well as parents with kids with adhd so enough about that so let's talk about first dopamine what that actually means having low dopamine so like i mentioned before use these people tend to who do have low dopamine levels can either have adhd depression have trouble focusing you know forget all the time remembering can have anxiety there's lots of symptoms that can be associated associated with basically having low dopamine levels and so dopamine is a neurotransmitter basically a chemical that our brain produces and it's also throughout our entire body so neurotransmitters are through our entire body so we can see low levels throughout our body as well but what we need to really realize before you go and try any of you know okay the things that as far as what supplements and other natural things that you can implement to increase dopamine levels you first need to test to see if you do have low dopamine levels in the first place you do need to see if there's other imbalances in your neurotransmitters and you can certainly test that something that we i do at my own place my own practice and i what i do with my own patients is to see where there's imbalances because it could be more than just low dopamine it could be other things that are imbalanced such as serotonin norepinephrine epinephrine just to name a few neurotransmitters and so it's really really critical to first do some testing to see what's in balance okay so first and foremost you do just need to check before you try anything of these things i suggest okay check with your doctor first as always especially if you're on medications because a lot of these medications can interact and if they're not done correctly you can run into some problems so when we talk about dopamine what becomes a problem is it's usually the nutrients that does help and provide basically building dopamine okay and i've talked about this in some of my other you know videos on talking about neotropics but let's talk about a few things as far as some some herbs as well as some other types of nutrients that can help contribute to dopamine so just to name a few n - acetyl is one rhodiola which is an herb that can actually help contribute and does help with increased dopamine levels and also mokuno purines which is an ayurvedic type of herb that you can use that has been shown that has some small levels of l - dopa in it now l - dopa is a precursor to dopamine to be able to actually help improve levels of dopamine and they've found in that actually particular herb it can help actually does have actually l - dopa in it another one is l - theanine so l - theanine has been shown to increase levels of dopamine so these are just a few that do help make the dopamine it's that process that if you do have low levels of dopamine you can certainly try using some of these different herbs and different types of aminos in different types of supplements that can help build those factors if you have low levels of dopamine now going a step further upon that sometimes it's the cofactor so a cofactor is usually what helps convert basically the process of making dopamine so that cofactor the process of making dopamine so like i mentioned before l - dopa is the precursor to dopamine and then from l - dopa it's tyrosine so it has a step process and in between that i'm actually converting it you have to use enzymes and then of course cofactors that help with that process of breaking it down creating the dopamine and so forth and then of course dopamine then makes norepinephrine epinephrine and those are very important also neurotransmitters in our body when they're imbalanced that can contribute to people who have anxiety or depression or adhd or having trouble focusing and remembering these things so taking that step further talking about cofactors there's certain types of nutrients that are key to actually have those cofactors to help break down that process from l - dopa to dopamine so just to name some important nutrients some important cofactors would be vitamin d vitamin b4 and b3 zinc as well as sam e just to name a few and also vitamin c are these are certain cofactors that are really critical now to know if you need these you need again run these tests there's a neurotransmitter test to be able to actually check your neurotransmitter levels to see if there's actually imbalances going on now if there's not i wouldn't be sitting there and experimenting to see okay you know let's try this type of supplements let's increase this it could eventually lead to be more damaging than good that's why you always need to check with your doctor first and to see if you do have these imbalances and that's something that i do like i mentioned before something that i always do with my patients or my clients that i work with who have trouble with focusing and paying attention or are dealing with adhd or maybe they think they have adhd or even have anxiety or depression so these are things that are really kind of crucial to be able to see before you actually implement a treatment plan because when you do this then you actually can see how natural medicine can be beneficial when you don't do this and you just are testing whatever you're going to find natural medicine not working for helping increasing your levels of dopamine and that's by that's why you got to be careful with this and if you really want natural medicine be effective first do the testing first so i hope you found this beneficial and before you go if you want to know more information as far as what types of nutrients to implement for adhd as well as what labs to run for adhd as well as what foods to avoid and foods to implement our free downloadable guide in the description below one for adults as well as for parents who have kids with adhd so until next time this is dr grand and remember you have an optimal mind thanks bye",

        "video_sub_title": "hey there welcome back to how to medicate and welcome to this new video where we will cover the most common causes of a low testosterone [ music ] for those of you are meeting for the first time my name is raoul i'm a medical doctor from the netherlands and i'm making weekly medical videos to educate myself as well as you my viewer because i believe that medically educated people make healthier decisions which is the whole point of this channel this video also comes with a quick disclaimer it's meant purely informative this is not medical advice and if you're looking for medical advice always contact your own doctor and now quickly let's get started let's first start off with some background information on testosterone testosterone is the male sex hormone and it contributes to the development of male genitals and a later life it plays a role in your libido muscle mass bone density blood sugar and metabolism as you see testosterone is involved in many different processes and therefore low testosterone can cause many different symptoms among which are difficulty sleeping low energy loss of body hair growth of breast tissue erectile dysfunction a lowering libido reduced endurance when exercising mental health problems and short - term memory loss which brings us to the most common causes of a low testosterone testosterone seems to peak in early adulthood and then slowly decreases over time it's part of your natural aging process losing about one to two percent of your production each year and this effect can become noticeable for men from their 50s and upwards and while a lowering testosterone can be part of your natural aging process it can also be caused by several underlying diseases or medical problems starting off by some dietary factors among which eating too much soy soy food is in structure quite similar to estrogen which is the female sex hormone and high levels of estrogen is associated with low levels of testosterone in addition you should eat fat in moderation as your body actually needs fat to produce testosterone so if you would consume too little this can contribute to lower levels of testosterone another contributing factor can be consuming too much bisphenol a this is found in plastic like plastic bottles and the next cause of low testosterone levels is being overweight or even obese this is especially important because your fat tissue can convert testosterone into estrogen to female sex hormone and again high levels of estrogen will cause a lower production of testosterone in addition being overweight can increase your risk on developing diabetes which is further associated with lower levels of testosterone next up is experiencing too much stress you see if your stress your body releases all kinds of other hormones like cortisol and high levels of cortisol can indirectly lead to decreased production of testosterone and the same is true for sleeping too little as little sleep is also associated with high levels of cortisol again indirectly decreasing your testosterone and the next cause is having too little sex however this is a bit of a downward spiral having too little sex can lead to a lower libido leading to lower levels of testosterone further decreasing your desire for sexual contact a shocking cause of low testosterone for those of you like to party is the consumption of alcohol as you hopefully know consuming too much alcohol is unhealthy for several reasons but one of them is that it can increase your chances of becoming overweight and it can more easily lead to several insufficiencies in your nutrients both potentially leading to low levels of testosterone furthermore for those of you who especially drink beers they contain hops which are also estrogenic further contributing to lower levels of testosterone then there are multiple medical conditions that can lead to lower levels of testosterone among them are some chronic illnesses delayed puberty testicular damage true trauma infections or testicular cancer and some genetic diseases such as kleinfeldtos syndrome and lastly various medical treatments can contribute to low levels of testosterone just to name a few chemotherapy radiation treatment for cancer hormone therapy and corticoid steroid drugs now i hope this video was helpful but if you have any questions please let me know in the comment section for those of you who want to keep learning check out the playlist i will put up there or in the description all that rest me is to thank my sponsors on patreon thank you sebastian who is an investor t supporter and thank all of you for watching but before you go please leave a like this will help out the channel tremendously and consider subscribing i'm trying to reach 10k subscribers before the end of the year and you could help me with it thank you all and as always i will see you next week with a new video bye bye you",

        "video_sub_title": "[ music ] hello everyone this time to giada i'm going to talk about that pain in your stomach caused by essentially a hole called an ulcer now the one important question i always ask my patients is okay does it improve after eating when you eat something does it go away or what happened does it get worse after eating okay those are two different concepts now if it is an ulcer what's the cause of an ulcer in no particular order aspirin and seds ibuprofen why because it reduces the production of the mucosal lining in your stomach okay our stomach is a big tube as if i'm sorry is a big bowl and it means a layer of mucus to protect it the inside so again aspirin and ibuprofen decreases our production of that nice mucosal layer in our stomach and that's how we get a hole in our stomach called an ulcer all the two of refined foods sugar sugar sugar sugar causes a lot of inflammation okay coffee now i'm not talking about that one or two cups a day i'm talking about the people who are drinking at least a gallon of coffee a day okay alcohol will do it but also to here's the main thing there's a bacteria we have good bacteria and we have bad bacteria in our system and we always want that nice little balance between the two what happens h pylori okay it 70 % of the cause of ulcers is due to this bad bacteria now the fun the reason why there's a bad bacteria because our stomach needs a certain ph level between one and three to make it acidic okay so if it's a little bit higher than three like three point five four so four and so on that means more alkaline and that will allow that h pylori bacteria to grow okay so nice 70 % of stomach ulcers are caused by this bacteria now what are the symptoms now again remember does it hurt after you eat does it hurt before you eat because again this the reason why it hurts is because you have pain caused by the acid that's going over the hole now there's again it's burning and cramping so again burning and cramping on an empty stomach so here here is the difference does it improve after eating yes it is then it's an ulcer if it gets worse after eating it's not an ulcer it's actually you have low stomach ph which means it's actually more alkaline okay and the cure for that is just simply to make yourself more alkaline and take a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar now here's the one caveat if you do take before if you do take outside of vinegar and it actually gets worse then it's definitely an ulcer okay so you always say play around the episode of vinegar if the apple cider vinegar makes your stomach better then it's just low ph but if this episode of vinegar makes it get worse then we definitely got an ulcer okay now what do you do if you have an ulcer the solution very simple remove the triggers number one remove overeating when we overeat like thanksgiving dinner holiday meals so far and so on we're not producing enough stomach acid okay and that mechanism breaks down the food products okay for absorption so stop overeating also spicy foods the body does not like spicy foods processed foods sugar sugar causes inflammation it will make the acid in your stomach less less between the ph between one and three caffeine will do it excessive amounts alcohol will do it in acidic foods that will all create that ph level instead of one and three it will make a more alkaline also too so what will happen is that the spice will actually burrell right through the stomach wall which will create the ulcer so number one remove the triggers number two change diet not forever okay but just long enough for you by to heal again is it due to the the aspirin are you creating a hole in your in your stomach or is it due to the h pylori because what you want to do if it's h pylori that's the bad bacteria you want to build up the good bacteria in your stomach that's the goal bone broth phenomenal for for stomach rejuvenation also ella vera juice helps them yukos a lining in the stomach it's kind of like a liquid band - aid also to steamed vegetables steamed steamed that not raw because many people have trouble breaking down raw vegetables due to a certain lack of an enzyme okay and now irritate the ulcer you want steamed vegetables just enough again you don't want to do you want to plead it with new from the nutrients okay so watch out steamed vegetables also cabbage juice cabbage juice has a lot of the probiotics that will help balance out that bad bacteria the good bacteria now supplements i recommend licorice root very important it helps coot and coat and soothe that your the the lining of the stomach wall okay well stu i'm sorry the licorice licorice root 500 milligrams a day chamomile tea same thing it helps calm down the inflammation i always recommend two glasses of chamomile tea a day supplements al glutamine power l glutamate powder 5 milligrams either you want to take it first for i'm sorry 5 grams first in the morning or at night time before you go before going to bed l - glutamine it's a phenomenal muscle recovery amino acid okay also - bone broth a collagen protein now either or you want to bone broth or collagen protein bone broth is phenomenal for muscle recuperation college and proteins phenomenal for most operations what is the stomach of the line what is the lining of the stomach coated its muscular its smooth muscle tissue and you want to repair that smooth muscle tissue and now he's recommending a minimal of one scoop of the powder in not milk you don't want any dairy milk because again if you have an ulcer that's going to curd chews like water or maybe you see how your you are with almond with almond milk okay if you have almond milk and it irritates it stick with water okay ulcers they're not fun to have they're pretty easy to fix number one thing remove the triggers gave yourself a good healthy 30 days okay change the diet take the supplements and you'll be better thanks for watching i'll see you next video everyone this dr. jawad hey it's the last couple of years my youtube channel has grown tremendously and i can only appreciate it the viewers who subscribe if you're watching this on youtube please hit the subscribe button to get the first up -

        "video_title": "At Home Earwax Removal!",
        "video_sub_title": "hey y'all so this is going to be kind of a an interesting video because it's knitted me too but i just went to cbs and i picked up and earwax removal kit because last night when i was going to bed i noticed that my ear my right ear kind of hurt and after some googling and whatnot i deduced that i have a buildup of earwax in my hair that is actually causing a bunch of pain in my ear i can also hear just like a lot of no random noise in my ear which is awful i had a really hard time sleeping last night and falling asleep last night and i couldn't sleep with the side of my ear that is in pain up without it being like super painful oak about 9 : 00 a. m. today and i tweeted how do i get rid of excess ear wax painful excess of your wax and most of y'all suggested your wax removal kay so i'm hoping that this works just because i this feels awful i feel terrible um since it cleanses the ear with foaming action to provide a safe non - irritating method of softening and removing earwax and ear wax will foam and i think that's because there's hydrogen peroxide in this so i'm going to open up the kit you get some ear drops and you also get this little object directions for use in the ear only tilt head sideways place five to ten drops into ear tip of applicators should not enter ear canal keep drops in here for several minutes by keeping head tilted or placing cotton in the ear use twice daily for up to four days if needed or as directed by a doctor any wax remaining after may be removed by gently flushing the ear with warm water using a soft rubber bulb or syringe so i think i'm going to put the drops in directly without the syringe i think the syringe is for later when you want to rinse it with water so i'm going to do that i've had a lot of problems with my ear when i was 12 years old i failed a hearing test at my school and i was i went to a doctor and i was diagnosed after like a series of getting a cat scan and whatnot i was diagnosed with a cholesteatoma which is basically a cyst that grows in your ear and destroys all of the bones in your ear and it you know if left untreated it's really dangerous and could just keep growing into your brain which is a terrifying horrible thing to imagine and so i had surgery on it and i had destroyed a lot of bones in my ear so actually the bones in my ear right now and my right ear are made out of the cartilage it's right here if you were to like look at me closely and examine me you would notice that i'm more cartilage here than here because this was cut out and then the cholesteatoma actually reoccurred the next year after like some follow - up stuff we noticed that it came back so i actually had to get it removed twice and since then i have had a lot of hearing loss which i don't think is necessarily normal for post cholesteatoma um but it hasn't come back and i also think that a lot of my hearing loss has to do with the fact that i have a excess amount of ear wax in my ear and this probably won't tackle the amount of ear wax that i actually have that needs to be removed but i think it'll do the job in order to at least make it significantly less painful for me i'm going to tilt my head and i'm going to place the ear drops in three four five and so i'm just going to hold it hold my head down so i was hoping that i would feel more fizzing but i don't actually feel any fizzing at just slightly disappointing because that seems like the fun part i'm actually going to put a few more drops in my ear see if that helps a little bit i'm not really feeling any relief yet and the liquid is very like looby it feels like lube it's very slimy i think there's probably mineral oil in this as well so i'm in the bathroom and some of it already came sort of oozing out of my ear so i'm going to try and kind of clean this up with this little contraption okay so i got some water in the syringe and i'm going to kind of shoot it into my ear hoping that that did something but it doesn't really feel that much better turn that off actually it doesn't feel really any better than when i started but i'm just shooting water everywhere alright so i put the drops in my ear and then i squirted everything out with the syringe i don't feel great um but i do think that the drops are going to take a little while to work so i'm hoping that i feel a bit better in a little bit i also think that the amount of wax my ear and the amount of maintenance that i need to do is very great and so i'm not sure how much this is actually going to work but i hope it does work so i'll keep you posted and i'll update you in a few hours and let you know how this earwax situation is going i'm and let you know if i try it again this is i can use up to two times so i'll talk to you soon hey y'all so i'm back um it is now 6 : 44 p. m. and i probably put the ear drops in about around about 1 p. m. um i'm not feeling a hundred percent yet i think i'm going to do the ear drops one more time but i also spoke to an old roommate who was dealing with this issue over the summer and he said it took him about a week to feel normal which is super stressful but it's okay it's not unbearable it's uncomfortable so i'm going to try these ear drops again so this time i'm going to lay down and i'm going to put the drops in one two three for five i'm not going to do more than five because it doesn't feel like it's really going down that much it's been an interesting day because i've wanted so badly to take something to my ear and like shove it in there and start like trying to scrape wax out but i know that's horrible for your ear and i've sort of just become aware of the fact that q - tips are not good for your ears either which seems bizarre that there's something that's marketed you know for cleaning your ear but then again lots of things that are not good for you or marketed to you so i guess i can't use q - tips anymore because apparently what happens is you if you push you kind of end up pushing all the wax back and making it worse um so you're kind of just like shoving everything down instead of pulling everything out like ears are so precious so i think i'm going to take a shower and try and sort of get some of this wax out of my ear or see what i can do with that little funnel thing hey so i'm out of the shower and it i definitely feel a little bit better the pain the initial pain that i was feeling and that discomfort seems to be subsiding and i think it helped also to get some like warm water in my ear i think that in terms of feeling improved hearing i haven't felt anything yet i think i'm going to keep using this for the next few days and see if that helps at all but it's definitely making a difference because i can feel it it seems a bit more bearable and i think it's just going to be a process because i haven't had my ears professionally cleaned in about five years and i used to do it almost every year most people don't need to have their ears professionally cleaned or really even bother with cleaning their ears because the ear wax does kind of regulate itself and it sort of falls out naturally but some people are just more predisposed to a buildup of earwax i don't know if it also has something to do with the fact that i did have a cholesteatoma and my ear has been affected in that way i'm happy with the results i think that it really helped me out this morning and i really needed to do a lot of stuff today and it helped sort of get me back on track instead of being so focused on my ear yeah just let me know if you've ever experienced something like this before if you have any tips on general wax maintenance or if you have anything that sort of works better than that or just anything you want to comment on let me know cool well i'll see you soon bye",

        "video_sub_title": "how to preserve a severed limb suffering or witnessing the separation of a limb from a body is horrible to even think about in such a scenario emphasis must be placed on taking care of the injured person call an ambulance immediately if you or someone in your vicinity has suffered the loss of a limb while it is sometimes possible to reattach a severed limb many factors can make reattachment impossible still the chances of a successful reattachment are high enough that you should preserve a severed limb after ensuring the safety of the injured person initiating emergency medical care call emergency services you must immediately call emergency services if someone has suffered the loss of a limb if an injury has occurred where there is no phone service or emergency services cannot be contacted or will be unable to reach the victim do everything you can to get the victim somewhere where you can get them additional help take care of the injured person first don't expend any attention energy or time on a severed limb until the injured person has been tended to only once breathing and circulation have been stabilized should you turn your attention to an amputated body part attending to the injured person must take complete precedence the rest of this section provides some basic advice on emergency medical services if it is only you and the injured person event in the limb and focus all of your attention on the injury the chances of reattachment are small and the limb should be forgotten entirely if retrieving it in any way jeopardizes the safety of the injured person don't overlook injuries that are less apparent than the amputation most importantly the victim must be treated for any airway or breathing issues shock bleeding and infection prevention don't attempt to push any body part back into place controlled bleeding apply direct pressure on the wound raise the injured area above the heart by laying the patient down if possible adjust and reapply pressure if bleeding continues if substantial bleeding continues a tight bandage or tourniquet can be used to apply the necessary amounts of direct pressure to close the wound be aware that using a tight bandage or tourniquet may ultimately damage tissue and prevent reattachment but must be employed if necessary to prevent persistent bleeding and keep the injured person alive apply a direct pressure dressing firmly over the site and watch for it to bleed through if it does then apply a tourniquet immediately if you apply a tourniquet apply it within two to four inches of the injury site be advised that an amputated limb may not bleed profusely early in the incident as blood vessels retract into the body as a self - defense mechanism this does not mean there is no need to apply direct pressure position the injury or the patient etc bleeding will commence and be severe take steps to prevent shock keep the injured person warm by covering them with a coat or blanket lay the injured person down on flat ground raise the feet about 12 inches to maintain circulation and blood flow to vital organs don't place the person in this position if a head neck back or leg injury is suspected as moving them may injure them further don't place the injured victim in any position that increases their discomfort or impedes their breathing attempt to calm and reassure the injured person while this may seem trite it can have a significant effect on preventing the person from going into shock keep in mind that patients suffering this sort of traumatic injury can be susceptible to fast mood swings anger panic etc don't take these things personally don't engage with the patient in discussing the situation just make general comments about the fact ms has been called and you are with them try to avoid saying things like you're okay as this can trigger more panic don't place the person in this position if a head neck back or leg injury is suspected as moving them may injure them further don't place the injured victim in any position that increases their discomfort or impedes their breathing attempt to calm and reassure the injured person while this may seem trite it can have a significant effect on preventing the person from going into shock keep in mind that patients suffering this sort of traumatic injury can be susceptible to fast mood swings anger panic etc don't take these things personally don't engage with the patient in discussing the situation just make general comments about the fact ms has been called and you are with them try to avoid saying things like you're okay as this can trigger more panic be aware of how the type of injury affects the potential for reattachment if the injury was caused by heavy machinery or a vehicular accident it is extremely unlikely that the limb can be reattached as substantial tissue damage has likely occurred if the limb is severely damaged or contaminated know that it will almost certainly not be reattach abul reattachment is more likely if the injury occurred via a sharp clean cut such as that from a guillotine or sharp industrial blade",

        "video_title": "What's a Tonsil Stone and how to get rid of Tonsilloliths",
        "video_sub_title": "[ music ] the doctor is in hi guys is your pal ducked his cell and today we're gonna take a look at tonsil stones aka tonsil ants so this video was basically prompted to my mind because in last week i saw a young guy with one of these tonsil stones and in this episode we're gonna take a look at what causes tonsil stones what are our tonsil stones and how can get rid of them both professionally and from home so first off let's take a look at what a tonsil stone even looks like what is a tonsil stone so if we look down here at my atomy board i'm just gonna show you using a screenshot this is a screenshot taken off the internet from wikimedia now what you'll see here is this little dinky thing here is the individuals uvula hello dingley finger this is the tonsil here tonsil here now this is a normal healthy tonsil on this side and whoa you can see there's definitely something not right here with this dude see right there that big white cauliflower appearing structure that is the tonsil a - - the aka tonsil stone now you might find it a little odd or bizarre that you would have or be able to form a stone in your throat well then actually turns out your body is actually exceptionally good at producing stones in fact i can tell you right now you've got 206 stones in your body as you sit or stand watching this presentation that's calling your skeleton every bone in your body is basically a biological stone you also form stones in your kidneys you can also form them in your inner ear you can form them in your brain you can form them in tendons so forming stones your body is no stranger to forming stones in other words however in most people i would say 90 % of people never are aware and have never had one of these tonsil stones so why is it that some people seem to be afflicted once sometimes multiple serial type stolen formers well the answer to that is not totally clear but i'll show you what we know to this point so we're gonna call this pitch in here tasha and actually before i tell you what tasha i'll tell you a little bit more about this story about the guy i saw in the past week so he gave a story of he was just sitting there my name is own business eating some ravioli it was nice soft it was slurping back it was delicious he was having a good time with his meal when suddenly out of the blue he felt like somebody had taken a knife and stabbed it into his tonsil so this so when i looked in basically i saw what you want to show you on the phone there what's smaller toss lifts than that and it might shock you but some of these tongs lists can actually get pretty large so we got to look a little skill here to give you an example some of the biggest ones recorded have been up to 42 grams so if you consider that this battery here is 45 grams that gives you some idea of the kind of monster that can happen of course that would be rare most cases are fractions of a gram usually very very tiny little things which would be more like the norm so i'm getting back to this case here of tosha she discovered she has a tonsil stone so first up what are the most common symptoms of having a tonsil stone well believe it or not the most common thing is absolutely nothing you don't even notice that is there and for that reason just like my buddy last week that i saw there with this stone most people when they first look in their throat and see one of these stones they immediately misconstrue that that stone must have just formed in the last day or two because they can't believe it was there probably for months to years but the stones don't originate over 24 hours it's just that most of the time because they cause no symptoms they just percolate there quietly like cavities for me until you finally notice something going wrong just like when you get a toothache from a cavity and that being said a lot of the formation also is kind of similar to forming a tooth plaque so if you imagine this is the does not hurt also this is the stone here grossly exaggerated so if i were to take her tonsil out just gonna do a little tonsil here one of the things you'll notice about tonsils is they're a lot like a miniature brain there's lots of grooves in them and folds they're not they're not perfectly smooth there's lots of crevices which we call crypts so that's the first thing that the first enemy that allows stone formation is these little crypts if they're tonsil is perfectly smooth it'd be hard for any any plaque to form on it so the first step is you have to have crypts so these little folds here these are called crypts so that's step number one the next thing to make this to perpetrate this crime is you need to have food or debris which is really easy because obviously the tonsils right on the path after you've eaten swallow it's gonna get stuff sticking into these crypts so you have a allele there of a bunch of different fibers and food particles and all kind of nasty crap they're sitting around some of it lodges and sticks its way into these crevices then you have our old friend which is also used in forming cavities bacteria so i'll draw it back towards this little of okay here so a little smirk on him he's up to no mischief sorry up to lots of mischief so there's our bacteria here so you have a family of bacteria starting to live on this nice little moon surface with this crevice here in your throat fed by all this food debris passing by wishing's pass here is some of it getting caught so just like with formation of a cavity initially what you get is a film so sit but starting here so you get this nasty film first which causes some inflammation and then gradually over time the film actually starts to protect itself by depositing calcium and other salts into the region which then forms a little stone so just bring you back again to your parents here let's see if we can get this a little brighter for you so again looking here this isn't the result of 24 hours of action this is probably months or years of bacterial activity to get it's still not large is benjamin franklin used to say constant dropping wears away stones well this is the opposite thing constant dropping of a little bit of deposition over time you come back months or years later and you have a monster like that okay so that's how they're formed and by the way the tall so why do we even need tonsils well the tonsils are basically a century system it's like having a police station in your throat so inside the tonsil there's lots of lymphocytes and other defense we call it cells so i'm just gonna draw this here it's a tonsil so here is our tonsil so it's a defense method a defense point so that's one of the reasons why you get things a strep throat and other kind of sore throats is because that was the first line of defense when some invader came in it gets stopped at this security checkpoint and then the tonsils get swollen so that's why we have tonsils no so i was mentioning what are the most common side effects for having a tonsil authority so stone well the two most common things like i said first i'm by far the most common is absolutely nothing so you don't notice a thing long until something does go wrong and the second is a bad breath or halitosis many cases of halitosis if carefully looked at there's an element of one of these stones another curious thing is that i've never seen one of these stones in anybody over 50 very often is young adults like the gentleman i saw last week he was probably maybe 22 or somewhere in that area and i remember also personally having one of these tonsil stones once probably when i was about maybe around 13 or 14 ironically enough i was in chemistry class and suddenly i for whatever reason i suddenly felt this this little hard bit in my rolling around in my mouth on my tongue so i couldn't figure out what that was all about because i was just in there paying attention to benzene wings and whatever else who were talking about and i extracted the extracted a little go the little flick and it was the most putrid thing i have every smile in my life and trust me working as a medical doctor for over a decade i've smelled some real horrors but this little tiny thing it packed quite a punch i was late wtf what the fibula it was so such a stink poem so i was got to be rid of that and i remember it was a little a little bit more a little darker than one i showed you in in the photograph there of someone else's tonsil earth but since that time i've never had one since it was just a one - off i've never seen one again so one of the other risk factors besides having crypts food bacteria and things like chronic sinusitis we're constantly having mucus bathing over here is also aged so youth usually young adults and why that is don't know know the million - dollar question the everybody's gonna wanna know is yes that's great to know what tonsil stone is but doc how do you get rid of that a little to my throat and i've got one oh forgot there's a third a third symptom too which is actually when my guy had come in last week the third thing is uh pain when you swallow so basically most of time you feel nothing and then occasionally when you start swelling you might notice that it causes pain in his case what had happened is the the tonsil left it looked as i had gotten shared maybe buy something to eat so instead of being a small stone when i looked in his store it was almost jagged and pointing out so obviously as his tongue roll past it would scrape so that's why was causing pain and some people even though it's doing nothing will just notice them by by accident because they look in the mirror or like what happened to me they expect to write one of these little stones wonder where the heck did that come from and then they look at it throw and see eugenie oh just a tip of an iceberg so i'm getting back to how do we get rid of them well there's there's two different broad ways so i'm just gonna draw a line here can you see that yeah so i'm gonna call this one the professional way which is to see one of my homeboys at your nose and throat or the other way is just dealing with it from home so i'm going to deal with the professional way first which is to see ear nose and throat ent there's one one method that that they can use to remove it i'm a family doc myself so i don't do this what i would do is refer you on to one of my colleagues that specialize in ent so one method is you take a freezing agent spread inside the throat then that reduces the ability to feel any any pain and then you use a tool that we call a curette a curette is almost i don't have one with me right now but it's it's almost like a long metal considerately tough work if you want to buy it it's more cylindrical and then on the end it has a tiny microscopic i don't call it microscopic but like a very small spoon on the end what's smaller than you obviously you would eat it so unless you were feeling like that long a budgie or something like that so anyway that's what a curette is so the curette you were just going after the throat is numb and then you grab you just pick away at this stone and pop it out so that's a curette curettage if you wanna sit in this french lingo another more modern method is using laser therapy so basically it's called it off the area blast it off and then one of my colleagues downtown they they have some new fancy ultra something which which i believe what it does is just like for kidney stones it it shakes the stone by resonance and causes it to shatter so these are the pro methods for getting rid of stone now from home now from home just because you're doing something from home doesn't mean it can't work it can be effective it just depends on your patients level if you're a patient then you can do it from home too by doing a chemical gargle so what are you doing is a chemical attrition warfare on the stone so morning and night you can either gargle with peroxide h2o2 and another method is gargling morning and night with vinegar apple cider vinegar now i don't really have preference of one over the other obviously if you have a huge stone or is causing pain then you probably want the faster method which would be the professional method if it's not too bad and you can wait you have time to burn then you probably could just do these gargles and just to give you an example of how the chemical method works i set up a little experiment here for you to see this is a bit of an exaggeration but we're gonna imagine this here is my stone here made predominantly of calcium so it's gonna break so got my calcium there on either side then in this little bottle here we've got some apple cider vinegar so vinegar and calcium creates a chemical reaction so i didn't remember some of that chemistry when i pulled off my tonsil stone so see when i add it it's causing a fizzy chemical reaction they're breaking down the stone well you can't smell this over you too but it actually smells quite nice oh it's kind of refreshing clean smelly no so that's using a apple cider vinegar this one here is using hydrogen peroxide which i picked up here at walmart and you'll notice it always comes in a brown bottle that's because it's photo degradation if you're leaving in sun it destroys the properties of a busy turns it back in the water so you always want a fresh bottle and you should notice that when you swish it in your mouth it starts forming the bubbling then you know it's active so i'm gonna try a little bit of this on this side too and [ music ] this one's a little more indolent it's not as fast as the acid - base reaction with the with vinegar but again you can see it's coming to life you can see that sweet bubbling this one [ music ] this one isn't as as aggressive smells it's almost smell less whereas this one had a kind of smell so anyway this is showing you basically an exaggerated version of what you're doing by gargling twice a day using those causing these acid - base reactions no in real life the the process is going to be much slower because each time the stone you can't get it the interior of the stone when you're gargling all you're doing is getting rid of this surface at a time so each time you gargle you destroy a little bit more of the surface and a little bit more of a surface bit by bit like erosion until finally ended a stone crumbles under its own weight or fragments into pieces and falls out or you just keep destroying the be chemically degrading it until there's nothing left so there you go that's again this is an exaggeration won't be this fast when you're actually doing it with your gargles so that ladies and gentlemen is tonsil stones and tonsil it's in a nutshell pun intended and how to how you can get rid of them from home or professionally by seeing one of my colleagues so thank you so much for watching this is again dr. sal and i'll have more doctors secrets coming for you in the next week or two thanks for watching thanks for watching get notified of new videos subscribe now [ music ]",

        "video_sub_title": "avoid alcoholic beverages that lead to high levels of acetaldehyde in your mouth. as soon as you take sip of an alcoholic beverage, microbes that naturally live in your mouth instantly convert alcohol into acetaldehyde. microbes that live downstream in your gastrointestinal tract will also convert alcohol into acetaldehyde. your liver also produces acetaldehyde when metabolizing alcohol, but your body then further breaks down acetaldehyde over period of time. avoid alcoholic beverages with high levels of pre - existing acetaldehyde. the alcohol level of the beverage has no consistent relation to the acetaldehyde content of the beverage. dilute alcoholic beverages. use non - alcoholic beverages that are unlikely to contain acetaldehyde such as club soda, seltzer water, and tonic water to dilute the alcohol and acetaldehyde content. this will help to keep the acetaldehyde content in your mouth and throat at lower levels. fruit juice may contain acetaldehyde. maintain excellent oral hygiene. the fewer microbes that are in your mouth, the better. brush, floss, and use alcohol - free mouthwash. however, you will not be able to totally eliminate the microbes that live in your mouth. take the amino acid l - cysteine before drinking alcohol. l - cysteine ( not n - acetyl cycteine or nac ) immediately neutralizes acetaldehyde, and it has been used successfully to lower levels of acetaldehyde in the body, especially in the stomach, when alcohol is consumed. drink water immediately after sipping or drinking alcoholic beverages. if the alcohol is removed from your mouth and throat right after you sip or drink and alcoholic beverage, the acetaldehyde and residual alcohol that could be converted into acetaldehyde will largely be removed from your mouth and throat. the less time that acetaldehyde contacts your mouth and throat, the less time cancer - causing levels will be in contact with your cells. drink alcoholic beverages as quickly as possible. remember that each and every time you take sip of an alcoholic beverage, the levels of acetaldehyde spike in your mouth. slam or chug alcoholic beverages so that they are in contact with your mouth and throat for the smallest amount of time possible. take care to do this safely in responsible manner. limit your intake of alcoholic beverages. the risk for cancers caused by acetaldehyde in alcoholic beverages increases in linear fashion. that basically means every drink increases your risk of cancer, an even one drink per day will increase your risk. three drinks will essentially triple your risk. also, if you drink to the point of being intoxicated, there will be high levels of alcohol and resulting acetaldehyde in your body even after you finish drinking alcoholic beverages. absolutely avoid drinking if you dont carry pair of effective aldh2 genes. people without an effective pair of this gene are unable to break down acetaldehyde in to acetic acid ( basically non - carcinogenic vinegar ) within their body as well as other people. therefore they are at much greater risk for cancers caused by acetaldehyde. an effective pair of the aldh2 gene is uncommon in asian populations ; either one or both are often defective. avoid homemade alcoholic beverages. while homemade beer ( homebrew ) and wine probably doesnt contain more acetaldehyde than many commercial examples, very high levels of acetaldehyde have been measured in homemade beer and wine. the same goes for distilled spirits ( moonshine! ). improper packaging and production methods ( fermentation, etc ) can lead to high levels of acetaldehyde.",

        "video_sub_title": "hi, i \u2019 m chris harper and with me is melissa and we are demonstrating an application for a low back pain. low back pain can be located across the low back or just above the pelvis and today we've placed or red dot just to demonstrate where that pain may be. ok, and low back pain can be caused by hip misalignment sitting or standing for excessive periods of time uh... inflammation from overuse or activity uh... or blunt - force trauma to the lower part of the back. how kt tape helps treat this condition is it relieves pressure, provides some support and may increase circulation to the area. for this application we need to have the skin on stretch, so the position for this is the flex forward as much as is comfortable before we apply the tape. so for our first piece we're going to take a full strip. we \u2019 re going to twist and tear the paper backing and peeling that back being very careful not to touch the adhesive. we're also going to stretch the tape by placing our thumbs across the tape and applying even pressure verses pressure like this which may cause some uneven pressure through the tape. so thumbs flat on the tape and we're going to apply this with eighty percent stretch. so what that is, if this is a hundred percent stretch we \u2019 re just going to back that off a little bit and apply that right over the area of pain. we \u2019 re going to pinch that off and as we remove the last bit of paper we \u2019 re going to leave the ends of the tape with absolutely zero stretch on that as we lay those down. we \u2019 re doing the same thing on this opposite side, just laying that piece down. and you give a little bit of a rub. for our second piece we \u2019 re going to tear second full strip and just like the first one we \u2019 re going to twist and tear that paper backing again being very careful not to touch the adhesive. apply even pressure on that stretch with our thumbs going just below that first piece were going to apply eighty percent. so full stretch backing that off just a little bit and laying that down. again it's important just to lay the end of the tape with absolutely zero stretch. again, same thing on the opposite side, opposite end of the tape is laying that down and give that a good friction rub. that \u2019 s just to activate the adhesive, heating it up just a little bit. make sure that's well adhered. go ahead and stand back up. you may see some wrinkling the tape that's what we do want to see across there. ok, some tips for this application is making sure that you clean the skin very well take some care with removing clothing as this may roll the tape just be careful with that area. some complementary treatments for this may be ice, rest, use of non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs, physical therapy or chiropractic care, strength training, some focusing on posture while sitting for prolonged periods of time such as at work or with driving and possibly using a new mattress if you \u2019 re having pain at night. please seek care if you have extreme pain or swelling, discoloration over the area or difficulty standing or marked loss of movement. for more information please see our website at kttape. com.",

        "video_sub_title": "synesthesia is a phenomenon in which stimulation of a certain sensation leads to a simultaneous activation of another unrelated sensory pathway for example some synesthetes see colors when they hear sounds while others can taste distinct flavors when they hear unrelated words remarkably this involves not only the five senses but also cognitive and mental experiences such as pattern recognition spatial orientation or even emotions some forms of synesthesia involve more than two senses or experiences at a time in theory there can be as many types of synesthesia as there are possible combinations of sensory or perceptual experiences but some forms are much more common than others these include grapheme - color synesthesia where individual letters and numbers are seen with a specific color sound - color or chromesthesia where sounds produce colors and spatial sequence synesthesia where elements of a sequence such as days in a week are assigned a specific location in a 3d arrangement around the person it's not uncommon for a person to experience more than one form once thought to be rare synesthesia is now estimated to be very common the numbers are far from accurate however perhaps because most synesthetes have their experiences since a very young age and don't realize that anything is unusual until much later in life at which point many tend to keep it a secret for fear of being different or diagnosed with mental illness with today's better understanding of the phenomenon synesthetes are more likely to come forward sharing their experience despite being referred to as a neurological condition by some neurologists synesthesia is not a disease it is not associated with cognitive or mental disabilities in fact synesthetes generally perform better in memory tests than an average person and tend to be more creative they have built - in capabilities that are to their advantage seeing colors when hearing musical notes can help achieve perfect pitch automatically arranging items in space aids with memory and having numbers color - coded can help quickly spot differences and patterns most synesthetes perceive their experiences as a gift rather than a handicap many tend to have inclination for creative artistic professions a true synesthetic experience is automatic involuntary and consistent over time these experiences are the only way a synesthete perceives the world a sound or a letter always gives the same color every time without fail and if they hear a new sound they never heard before or see a new character they never seen before a color will be automatically assigned to it some drugs may produce synesthetic - like effects but these are not real synesthetic experience because they don't last genetic makeup seems to have a role in predisposition to synesthesia as it tends to run in family but family members can have different forms of synesthesia mechanism of synesthesia is still poorly understood but there is evidence that the crosstalk between various sensory pathways accounts for the experience for example with the help of brain imaging techniques the brain v4 region responsible for color recognition can be seen activated when a sound - color synesthete is presented with auditory stimuli synesthetes also seem to have more gray matter in the implicated brain areas as well as more white matter connecting them there is a theory that we are all born synesthetic with all the connections between senses but lose them together with synesthetic ability as our brain matures whilst synesthetes retain it this may explain why most people still have some degree of synesthesia as adults let's see if you have it which of these shapes is named \" kiki \" and which \" bouba \"?",

        "video_title": "Bipolar disorder (depression & mania) - causes, symptoms, treatment & pathology",
        "video_sub_title": "maybe you \u2019 ve heard the term \u201c bipolar \u201d used to describe someone who \u2019 s moody, or who has mood swings, but this colloquial use of the term is really different from bipolar disorder. bipolar disorder, which used to be called manic depression, is a serious mental illness that causes a person to have dramatic shifts in emotions, mood, and energy levels : moving from extreme lows to extreme highs. but these shifts don \u2019 t happen moment to moment, they usually happen over several days or weeks. there are a few different types of bipolar disorders, but there are some common features. first, the low moods are identical to those in a related disorder - major depressive disorder, also known as unipolar depression. individuals with this can feel hopeless and discouraged, lack energy and mental focus, and can have physical symptoms like eating and sleeping too much or too little. but along with these lows, the thing that sets bipolar disorders apart from unipolar depression is that individuals can have periods of high moods, which are called manic episodes or hypomanic episodes, depending on their level of severity. in a manic state, people can feel energetic, overly happy or optimistic, even euphoric with really high self - esteem. and on the surface, these might seem like very positive characteristics, but when an individual is in a full manic episode, these symptoms can reach a dangerous extreme. a person experiencing mania might invest all of their money in a risky business venture or behave recklessly. individuals might talk pressured speech, where they talk constantly at a rapid - fire pace, or they might have racing thoughts and might feel \u2018 wired, \u2019 as if they don \u2019 t need sleep. manic episodes can also include delusions of grandeur, for example they might believe that they are on a personal mission from god, or that they have supernatural power. and they might make poor decisions without any regard for later consequences. one way to understand these swings is by charting them on a graph. so let \u2019 s say y - axis is mood, with mania and depression being on the far ends of the axis, and the x - axis is time. the average healthy individual might have normal ups and downs throughout their life, and they might even have some pretty serious lows once - in - awhile, maybe after losing a job or moving to a new place and feeling lonely. an individual with unipolar depression though, might have the normal highs, but they might have some crushing lows that last for a long period of time and may not have an obvious trigger. now, for the bipolar disorders, the first one is called bipolar 1, and these are people that have some major lows that last at least 2 weeks, and some major highs that last at least a week or require hospitalization. that said, untreated manic episodes can last as long as 3 - 6 months. depression is seen in most cases, but is not required for a diagnosis. the second one is called bipolar - 2, and this is when a person experiences similar lows, and has additional highs called \u201c hypomania \u201d, which are less severe manic episodes than we see in bipolar 1. to qualify for a diagnosis, these hypomanic states need to last at least four days. once again though, these symptoms generally last a few weeks to a few months. alright the third one is called cyclothymia, or sometimes cyclothymic disorder, and these individuals have milder lows as well as the milder highs or \u201c hypomania \u201d like you see in bipolar - 2, and they cycle back and forth between these two over a period lasting at least 2 years. sometimes, people with bipolar disorder can show other, less common symptoms as well, for example having what are referred to as mixed episodes \u2014 experiencing symptoms of both depression and mania at the same time. another symptom they might have is rapid cycling, which describes a situation where a person has 4 or more episodes of depression or mania within a given year. like most mental health conditions, the exact underlying cause of bipolar disorder isn \u2019 t known, and there is no single \u201c bipolar gene \u201d identified, but it \u2019 s thought that there are genetic and environmental factors that play a part. for example, one interesting clue is that people with family members who have bipolar disorder are 10 times more likely to have it themselves. another clue is that some drugs and medications can trigger manic episodes, like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( or ssris ). it \u2019 s also worth mentioning that people with bipolar disorder often have other disorders like anxiety disorders, substance use disorders, adhd, and personality disorders as well, making diagnosis and treatment a real challenge. even though there \u2019 s no cure for bipolar disorder, identifying and treating individuals is really important, since there \u2019 s a real danger that the person could harm themselves or commit suicide. one of the oldest treatments is also one of the most effective treatments, and that \u2019 s lithium salts. lithium acts as a mood stabilizer \u2014 smoothing out the highs and lows they experience. that said, it is much better at treating manic rather than depressive episodes, and so individuals who take it often have to take other medications as well, which can be problematic since some antidepressants ( like the ssris ) can trigger manic episodes in individuals who are predisposed to them. other treatment options include antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, and benzodiazepines, but many of these \u2014 including lithium \u2014 have side effects that can be severe and lead to non - adherence which can be dangerous for an individual. now, unlike certain disorders like unipolar depression, psychological interventions, like talk therapy, or cognitive - behavioral therapy are not particularly effective in treating the manic episodes of bipolar disorder. having said that, they can still be very helpful tools to help individuals with bipolar disorder in general \u2014 especially after a manic episode has ended. they can also help an individual handle stressful situations that might otherwise lead a manic episode, thereby helping to prevent a potential manic episode in the first place. alright, so super fast recap : bipolar disorder is a mental disorder characterized by depression, periods of lowered mood, as well as mania, periods of heightened mood. thanks for watching, you can help support us by donating on patreon, or subscribing to our channel, or telling your friends about us on social media.",

        "video_sub_title": "hey everybody it's doctor jo, i'm just chilling out here by the fire nothing to do. it's the doorbell! jack! come on in. hey doctor jo. hey how ya doing! good to see ya! everybody, this is my buddy, jack. i met him at youtube's nextup. tell us a little bit about your channel. so my channel is called a healthy gamer, and i make a bunch of fitness videos to help video gamers get healthier, and strong, and confident. awesome! so i hear you've got a little little hurtin going on. right so when i started exercising, i just did the traditional bodybuilding stuff. i just did tons of bench presses, and i mean tons of chest presses. if i would do it in the overhead, i would be like like dumbbell overhead, but i would be on a bench, and basically doing another bench press, so over the years my chest and my lats have become really really dominate and really you know, too strong, and you know now i can raise my arms like this far before they just don't go any higher. and i and i get, right, and then i start to get shoulder pains, especially if i don't do anything anything like any growing exercises, i just start getting real bad shoulder pains, i'm waking up in the morning if i slept on my side. i just have especially my left shoulder, just shoulder pain. okay that's that's pretty common especially with lots of lifting going on, and i think i've got some stretches and exercise for that so let's check it out! so a lot of lifters like jack, when you're first starting out, you really want to pump out that chest area, you're working on a lot of those movements and you kind of miss out on the back, and then you end up having those shoulders roll forward because you have those tight pecs and then when you have those tight pecs, when you roll forward, then you end up having a lot of those shoulder issues as well. so we'll stretch out the chest, and we'll stretch out the shoulders, and then we'll work the upper back a little bit to strengthen that and get you back in a good proper position. one of the best chest stretches that i like is using a foam roller. if you don't have a foam roller, you can just roll up like a beach towel just to give you a little bit of a lift. so what you want to do is put it in a vertical position. it's going to be where your spine is, so you're just going to kind of roll onto it and make sure that your head is supported so then your neck doesn't fall off of it and get super extended, and then you're just going to bring your arms up. come into a stop sign position, and then let those elbows drop, and so that's really gonna open up that chest, stretch those pecs muscles, all those chest muscles, and you can hold it for about thirty seconds. you can change your position a little bit just to get the different muscles, so you can go up higher, you can kind of go into a wide position, but i like starting off with this one and just letting those elbows drop. so again holding that for 30 seconds, and then doing that three times. i also like, to help stretch the shoulders and a little bit of the chest area, is to go into a prayer stretch. for the prayer stretch, you want to get on your knees and you're going to bring out your arms as far as you comfortably can, kind of placing your head on the ground. for getting a little bit of the lats to stretch as well, you can go in an angle, so i'm going to do all those. so just starting off, you're gonna kind of go into that prayer stretch, and you can creep your hands forward, and you'll feel it in the shoulders there to get more of that shoulder flexion, and then coming back up. you can just hold it 10 to 15 seconds or so, and then go add a little bit of an angle to get more of the shoulder and to get those lats a little bit, so then you're going to come off to the side this way, so again holding 10 to 15 seconds, you can work your way up to 30 seconds if you want to, but you don't have to. coming up, and then just going straight down. so if you have a chair that has an opening like this one, this works great because you just come back and kind of grab on the seat back there. you want to keep your upper body straight, keep your chin kind of tucked in, not looking down, and just lean forward so that's gonna get a nice stretch in your shoulders and your chest area. if you don't have the opening here, but you have a backrest where you can put your arms around you can do that as well, so just kind of put it back and then still just leaning forward, so that'll still open up that chest and stretch those shoulders a little bit too. you can also just kind of put your elbows there and come forward as well and that again kind of stretches that chest and pec area, so just doing that, leaning forward as much as you can, but i really like the one that has the opening because i feel like you can get a better lean with that. so that works really nicely as well and holding those if you can for about 30 seconds and doing three of those. so the next stretch again will stretch the shoulders and the lats a little bit, so get yourself into a lunge position, and then what you're gonna do is you bring up the arm of the side that you want to stretch, and take the other hand and kind of place it below so you're going to come up and then lean over, so almost like you're taking your hand towards the other corner of the ceiling, and if you want to get your hip flexors a little bit, you can lean forward and get that stretch as well, but you're coming up and over and kind of pushing that other hand towards that side to get that stretch. so again holding that for 30 seconds, and then doing that three times on each side. so i'll show you forward as well so you can kind of see that lean, so this hand across this one, up and over, and then kind of pushing that hip out a little bit will give you that extra stretch, so almost like you're reaching towards the ceiling on that side and kind of pushing that hip out so you'll get that stretch all the way through here, and then the next stretch is going to be with the swiss ball. look at that it just showed up! so again with chest stretches, there's a whole lot of ways you can do it, you can do it on the foam roller, you can do it in the corner, and stretch that when people do that one. but you can also stretch it on the swiss ball. so just kind of leaning on it where it's on your mid - back, so you have a little room to let your your chest and your shoulders open up a little bit, and the same kind of thing, like when on the roller, start off with your hands kind of in that stop sign and just let them stretch, and if you want to get a different position you can come up a little bit and then just let those arms hang down. and this is nice because you can just relax on the ball and let that chest open up so holding it for 30 seconds and doing that three times. alright now we're gonna do some awesome exercises, so these exercises are for the upper back they're gonna be the is, ts, ys and ws. a lot of times you'll see people do them just lying on their stomach flat on the table, but doing it on a swiss ball makes it a little bit harder because you have this unlevel surface so it works your core as well, it makes your core and your upper back work together, so i really like it on the swiss ball. so you're gonna get it kind of in this position where you're up on your toes because once you get on the ball you want to bring your knees off the ground, that's what's gonna make it a little bit harder, and have you have to work your core a little bit. so trying to get it a comfortable position on the ball, and as you can see i'm on my toes my knees are off the ground, and then you're going to start off in that i position with your thumbs up, and just bring them up this way, so just starting off with about ten of those and then you're going to come into a t. still with those thumbs up, and come really trying to squeeze those shoulder blades together doing ten of those. then you're going to go into a y position. same thing trying to squeeze those shoulder blades together, and then the last one is the w. so bring your elbows bent now and put your palms down and then still trying to squeeze those shoulder blades together. so ten of each of those. so there you have it, those are some stretches and exercises for the chest, shoulders, kind of back area, and hopefully they will get you to loosen up and get ya back in all the gaming without hurting. so don't forget to subscribe to jack's channel, and don't forget to subscribe to askdoctorjo, and remember, be safe, have fun, and i hope you feel better soon.",

        "video_sub_title": "before isn't this video on a clip remind everybody that once we hit a hundred subs i will make a huge three foot tall on that is way too big because it's three feet tall and then i will probably injure myself badly on it anyways if you haven't subscribed yet you should subscribe so you will see when i make that video and so we get closer to a hundred subs so i will make that video i will not make it until we get 100 subs though so we have to get there first okay now back to what this video is actually about okay so i may have bought some more plywood to build more ramps bought two more sheets all right here and here ish bought some math tonight and then i did buy some two by fours because how else are you going to build a scooter and i just felt like building a micro quarter for here because this is where we actually live and that ramp is at a lake house and i can't use them very often so i decided i'll build a mic recorder here and a uh what's it called ticker ramp i think yeah that's pretty much what it's called i think so i guess i'll just start chopping up this well this is the 3 / 4 inch like i did with the other one this is going to be sides and one of the other things i'm going to be doing with these two ramps is i'm going to build them only out of a jigsaw okay i might cheat a little bit using my two top and i'll show you how to cut two backwards of the jigsaw [ music ] [ music ] okay i've got these side panels for the kicker ramp built and the ramp i'm building is going to be one foot tall four feet long and 4 feet wide oh and if you're wondering why is you a jigsaw to cut straight cuts it's because i was trying to prove that just was this one tool you can build a whole skate ramp you don't need any fancy tools i like my fancy tools but you really don't need it like you can just sit with a jigsaw the cuts won't be as perfect not that my cuts are perfect they will be they'll be good enough for any ramp you will ever need to build it just takes a little bit longer but that's fine when you only need to spend $ 100 then ok now we need to cut the what's it called again there is the two by fours that go in the middle of the ramp and again i will be using a jigsaw for that [ music ] yes we [ music ] okay i've got two of the board's cut and if i lay them down move a straight not this end we perfectly start with each other this is go over here there's legs act right sighs like they're flush with each other there's a little gap right here vanessa from warping meaning cutting two by fours with a jigsaw doesn't work just fine it will take you a little bit longer because it's a jigsaw and not a miter saw but it is totally doable well because i'm lazy i'm going to cut all mine with a miter saw okay so i miter saws out and my shed which is also where all of my fish are they're just right behind this camera right there i have to keep all the dust from this miter saw out of here because i don't want to get the sawdust in the aquarium so i've got that dust collector right there but i need to put that outside so all the dust gets vented to outdoors okay i got the desk click to set up and everything tonight i just need to cut up all my three boards okay i'll the burglar cut noticing to bring in the dust collector that is now inside and now i'm yellow okay i got all the one in here on the three - quarter inch sheet of plywood and now i will be using that for my table so now i understand start assembling it i've got before i start assembling everything i need to cut off the ends again so they don't break off okay now i am start assembling it okay so i just realized that i forgot to pick up screwed through this let me i rep sick of screws for the ramp thing and it's already pretty late so i cannot pick up screw tonight and work on this so i'm going to have to continue this video tomorrow okay now we are back the next day as you can see by the bright window back there and i did get screwed so now i can actually build this ramp behind me [ music ] [ music ] okay the ribbing is done on this i think it took under 30 minutes to do because little is stuff like these things don't take too long apparently like let's see there is one seven ribs and that took very short amounts of time so if you don't have a book on time or whatever to build something something like this kicker ramp would be possible in about three hours i think now you can throw on the top for this thing and the masonite and then i do need to put some steel down at the bottom down there at some point in time the person you get that steel which is a little bit harder oh and if you want a more detailed explanation on how to put in the ribs check out the video before this on rebuilding a quarter pipe it shows a lot more in depth on how to put in the ribs for a any sort of skatepark anything [ music ] okay i got the plywood on there but as you can see it's very very long so i need to cut it but right here just like all the other ramps and he's we cut throat making that on and then i'll be done unless i paint it and just like everything else i'm going to use a jigsaw to trim this this thing down not because it's the best option but because i want to show how you can build a ramp out of only a jigsaw [ music ] okay now that the bottom of this thing is cut right there i have to run to paint star like sherwin williams to get some primer it is actually black but it says it's white racist okay that's a joke okay i'm not racist anyways i have to get zapped because i never got this this is not crusher treated this is just normal lumber and i don't really wanted my pressure treated so what i'm going to do instead that have heard that works from people that know what they're talking about is paint it i'm just going to paint the whole bottom of it and hopefully that should work instead of pressure treating it and then i can also paint these sides because they are ugly first i need to put primer on though because well that's kind of how paint works okay i got it propped up behind me i need to start with painting the bottom [ music ] okay so as you can see everything on this side has been primered or whatever the proper term is but on the ramp side it has not been building maisonette on this but one of the things you have to do if you paint one side of something you have to paint the other side or else it works go on painting the side [ music ] ah [ music ] okay both sides are just painted like this because it looks better than this color right here i like the black more so that's what i went with okay it's about an hour later so this thing should be dry i'm hoping so now i just need to move it on to my table right here so we can put on me masonite okay we have got it on this table this thing's really heavy now i'm going to grab that to the basement right back there is yeah right there and throw it on top of here and then we'll need to chop it down to size and then we'll be done for now okay i got it all screwed down i have two rows of screws one about right here one right over there six inches in from each side artists need to cut this really long bottom section off okay i've got it marked off right here where i need to cut it i'm going to try it without a guide of any sort i'm just going to freehand it because my guides have been failing me they have not been guiding my saw very well it's done well mostly i mean we'll need to eventually put coping on it but for now it's done ok i'm going to get this thing on the ground so i can try it ok it is on the ground i don't need these anymore so now i'm going to try it have a little scared i have very little space behind it but really hope i don't hit anything [ music ] [ music ] okay that thing is amazingly fun i need to put coping at the outlet because you can hear it cracking i don't know if that's of masonite or then you know there pratt plywood so i'm going to add another layer plywood and at the coping hopefully that goes away then so i guess he'll be it for today's video i really hope you guys enjoyed it remember 100 subs and although the three footlong see i think you very much for watching like if you liked it subscribe if you liked it to you [ music ]",

        "video_sub_title": "[ music ] okay so doing a timing chain replacement basically just that timing chains probably old worn out never been replaced on this craigslist engine here so i just want to put it in my car and have it run not have any problems so going to replace timing chain cover timing chain and the harmonic balancer and go through and replace the oil pans feel just that hopefully i won't have any problems with it so just go through once the water pumps off and harmonic balancers off you can get to the timing chain cover take these bolts off all right so i got the old bolts out here now and got kind of pried off and funny thing we're looking at it and it looks like two seals on this actually so it's just interesting kind of shows it's been off before then so maybe the chain had been replaced but it seems kind of loose but anyways when you're pulling this off you can see that dowel pin in there you pull this out past that and so you're free to dowel and then you can just kind of bump up on the bottom here and the cover should slide out of that pan right there and then you got your at full access to the timing chain okay so i have the cover off here basically when this was coming off and just kind of i had to pull out quite a ways here and basically if you look here you see this seal around here this this rubber seal right here it was just kind of it was old needs you know very stiff and so it kind of started to actually break i mean which is why i was able to pull the cover off you look down in the bottom of this cover here you see all the seal material this gasket material it's all kind of crumbling and falling apart but on both sides here you can see with this seal those cracking had to be pulled out and like i said very stiff so that had ones that broke free then it came right off now going looking at a timing chain here we got all this slop right here this drive side is pretty tight maybe it could pass and be fine but while the engines out it's really easy to do this so that's why i'm doing it now and timing chains are pretty cheap now so this way i know it's good so yeah kind of good take this off and put a new one on alright so what i'm going to take this off here again and try to do this as simply as possible so that i don't have to refined top dead center or anything but i'm just lining up through the mark on the both of the pulleys here for the chain so if these are in the same spot opposite each other on the crank and the cam bolt then when you pull them off pull the gears off and put the new ones new set on if you line those up again you crank and you're cranking your cam they're not going to move so you don't going to get off a gear or anything or off the tooth so this way you know that it's right if you pull it off straight don't turn anything put it back on straight then you know you have it right and you're not going to mess anything up all right i got bolt off here now and if you look there's that dowel pin right there and it'll just pop right off over the top of that and then that's how you take the top pulley off there and everything is loose then it'll come right off okay so looking at my crank on here it's kind of interesting because i'm looking at it and you can see that really well looks like it almost looked like it was cracking on the end here all the way around there's these marks on it and think what it is actually is from a pipe wrench on the end of the crank here somebody was turning the motor over with a pipe wrench and it cracked it or made these scratches in it here so somebody obviously wasn't treating this engine very well at all but you know it probably should still run for me so i'm just going to go with it okay so i'm pulling off this bottom gear here just got a two - leg puller on it it doesn't take too much effort just simply with a wrench here and it's not even enough to turn the motor over so you can also worry about spinning it really but it's just you see it in just one hand not even all the way out on the wrench and it's just kind of slowly coming off so just be careful do this do it go straight with it but that gear should come right off for you okay so i got the gear off here and you see that obviously the three key ways for it so you could get it a third of a rotation off but thing to look at is you get this chamfered edge on it here on the inside just make sure that when you put the new on on that you get the chamfered edge on the inside again otherwise you won't have your marks on the outside okay so putting this timing chain gear back on basically i know there's probably a better way to do this but i'm just using a socket seems when i go to method but sits over top of the shaft here large enough in the point on one of the hexes which it should sit around this key on a gear here so before i put the this on i'd already went around and scrapes a gasket material off of here so that's good and clean and before i start pounding on here i got the backside of this crank braced up against the engine stand here so that i'm not pushing the pushing on the crank and wearing out bearings there so it should be braced this way so i'm not going to ruin those bearings and just putting this on here so just kind of pounded on should go fairly easily easily you don't need to really whack on it if you have to hit it too hard you it's probably not going on straight you should probably stop and look at it and see if something's going wrong on it okay so got a big gear out so what i'm going to do you line up sorry this dowel pin right here and this hole in the gear and if you're wondering which resides goes out look at the mark on it you see that dot and then mark it up match it up to the circle on this right here that's for the factory setting i was looking the circles for the factory i believe the triangle it's for advancing and squares for retarding the timing but basically what you want to do you put the chain on the bottom and you have the chain on top before you put the dowel on and then you make sure that your marks are going to line up straight and then you put the pin on so if you're off one tooth then stop reset it and make sure it's straight on before you get this top gear onto that dowel and then you can tighten bolts down okay and so what i did here to put this on instead of fighting it what i did was i went on the backside of the engine on the flexplate and i just turned it over a bit to pull this or to be able to turn this higher just top gear in regards to turn the crankshaft to get this dowel hole higher so it's easier to put on then i turned it back made sure my alignment pins are store alignment marks are still straight on here don't have the bolts in yet but you can see it straight i got dowel pin in and bolts are lined up now so saddles that makes it so much easier than trying to fight to try to get this dowel pin in that one okay so i looked at the specs here on how tight to put the bolts on this upper gear here and what it said was 20 foot pounds and threadlocker so you just need to drop of it on here but 420 foot - pounds i know it's not a lot i'm still going to do it in two or three increments i'm thinking i'm going to go to 10 and then 20 and since i'm using old bolts again i'm actually just going to up it a little bit and go up to 25 for myself just a little bit not too much so you don't strip it but it makes me feel a little bit better with that 5 pound tire because when you get to these older bolts that have already been stretched at 2 to 20 pound mark hopefully that's what they were set to and so if i go 25 then it will tighten it a little bit more and you can stretch the bolts just a little bit against that it's tight okay so i stuck these bolts up and three different increments and tighten it down it did i didn't even have it pressed up all the way tight before i had the bolts on so i was tightening and brought it in tie it against there and you do that equally so that it sets flat again and flush against the face there but now this is installed you can see here there's almost no play in this chain at all versus the other one that you can see this whole side was just really bad so shows you what the new one looks like in comparison right there but next step i need to put had a new gasket for this you should always put a new gasket on if you're going to take it off this one was all dry rotted out so it definitely in the end replace but got a new gasket for put the cover back on and she'll be set okay so i'm putting on my timing cover gasket here i actually have the oil pan off because i was replacing that gasket also but her star was just a timing cover here i bought a gasket from fel - pro it also came with the seal here that your harmonic balancer would go into so i replaced that to pull it out put a gasket sealer on around on the outside of there and then i took some it's called the right stuff it's basically just a gasket maker and so i only have five minutes i'm trying to do this quick after you apply it but clean the surface off and then i put some gasket maker there on the back side of this feel front side of the seal and over this corner right here so i can get a good seal on it and get that way there's just no chance of it weakened",

        "video_sub_title": "hi guys i'm going to show you how i make my homemade deep conditioning treatments so you will need a mixer an empty container one egg and avocado extra virgin olive oil and a measuring device so why these ingredients the avocado is a good fat it's very moisturizing to the hair it contains vitamin e vitamin b and other vitamins the egg contains protein the olive oil gives the hair a shine now i started out with my empty container my avocado is in there as you can see i'm not using the seed and my avocado is peeled and i'm going to add 2 tablespoons of olive oil this shows only one tablespoon but i did use two now i'm going to add my egg i'm going to use my electric mixer so that way i can have a smooth finish and everything is mixed really well now if you could mix this without an electric mixer you could do so just use a spoon or some kind of mixing device so my mixture is thin but it's not watery so my hair is wet i did add smooth and silky conditioner by giovanni you don't have to add conditioner to your hair so as you can see the outer part of my hair is already done and tucked away now i have two more portions to complete i'm spraying my hair with water to ensure that my hair is wet you can apply this to dry hair but i do think that when the hair is wet first is easier to apply it's okay now doing this process i am removing shedding hair i'm detangling my hair also so i'm doing all this in one which makes it easier so i applied small sections at a time okay and what i'm doing i'm pulling my hair i'm stretching out my hair but i'm also giving the hair a smoother finish by stretching the hair and applying the conditioner and like i said earlier i'm also removing shedded hair at the same time and you definitely want to apply this to detangle hair so if your hair is not detangle detangle as you applying this to your hair and i'm applying this from root to tip okay here you can see that i'm applying a little more making sure that that section is well covered and as you can see i'm stretching it i'm pulling the hair okay that section is complete i'm just going to twist it and tuck it away with a hair clip now move along to the last section and i'm just using the same technique that i did previously i'm adding water making sure that the hair is wet and not dry remember i already have conditioner in my hair that's why it looks white like i said before i'm just applying the traditional small sections at a time just to make sure that the hair is covered with the conditioner throughout as you can see i'm using that stretch motion to just give it a nice and smooth finish here you can see my hair pattern with the conditioner in it and i will be doing this treatment to my hair every couple of months when i remove my braids or before i add my braids this section is complete so i'm twisting and i'm going to tuck it away i'm not quite finished i'm going to add the product to the edges of my hair i'm going to add it to my hairline to the back of my hair making sure that it's covered throughout from root to tip now i'm going to reapply it to the ends of my hair because the ends of my hair is the oldest parts okay which is the driest part so i just want to make sure that my aunts are well moisturize remember moisture equals to hair that does not break and as you can see here i'm just continuing on with the steps just making sure that the ends is well moisturize with this conditioner and here i'm just basically doing a check just to make sure that all the ends are covered the hair is not dry the hair is fully fully covered with this conditioner and i'm as you can see here i'm applying it to the roots of my hair and as i'm applying and i'm also smoothing it with the product i'm smoothing it i'm just making sure that i have a nice smooth finish at this point i am done and i'm going to apply my shower cap to my hair i'm using a shower cap to provide heat i am going to use two shower caps to make sure that the hair is covered this is my second shower cap and then i'm flying it more towards the back now i'm going to add my satin bonnet as you can see my son barnet is stretchy so i'm just going to secure it with a goody ponytail holder with no metal of course okay you leave this in for 20 to 45 minutes you will shampoo your hair as usual you would then condition your hair as usual this deep treatment leaves your hair feeling soft moisturized and shiny hope this helps thanks for watching and god bless",

        "video_sub_title": "hello to all guys here we are again to make another face mask in fact in the last video i had already mentioned that i had recorded a video tutorial to make a very delicate and purifying summer mask for the face with simpler ingredients to understand indeed that damask rose powder and here we are with this new recipe just as simple with simpler ingredients are few of pivot but to be able to really buy in our city in fact i will use dried or essential demand flower of lavender and white clay that you want to buy safely in herbalist shop then we will also use a normal face cream and then also in corn starch which is found at the supermarket you will also find further explanations in the post on my blog of which i leave you the link box information and also any substitutions and omissions i also recommend you to make this mask no more than once every seven ten days during the summer because otherwise it can be risky during exposure to the sun to have skin that we say has just been treated and remember to have a clean and dry face so it does not matter if you have not made up your face during the day in the same way clean it and dry it with a dry cloth a few minutes before the application i will also be completely removed so don't be scared it was completely used a shift between the career now is the one that sees the soon anyway be calm that sum a rho lens this mask must be performed in this way like all masks in general so i leave you to the recipe and the procedure and see you for the application first of all let's pulverize our dried lavender flowers that you can safely buy in herbal medicine i repeat, however, that you can also use other types of dried flowers because they are only needed to give an exfoliating effect so there will be no effect given by the plant because it will not be used such as a leonida but it will be directly bewitched on the skin so you could use chamomile flowers or marigold flowers or even mallow flowers in this case decided to use lavender also because then i will use the essential oil of lavender to make our purifying mask so i put them inside a mortar and i go to crush the flowers to organize ours are pulverized we can continue with the rest of the ingredients let's go to pour our dried flowers into a small bowl and add the white clay you can also find this in the herbalist's shop they sell it from the tree of all the herbalists and we also add the corn starch that you can easily find in the supermarket and mix between their things already the scent of lavender is really strong because the flowers have one naturally very very strong fragrance in this mask we add a face cream little by little you can use any type of face cream to make the mask very very moisturizing and soothing and we mix again and now if you like, add a combined one you could add a lavender yeast or of chamomile also of calendula in this case i am using an unpublished carrot because i have finished all the other oils i had and they had already used rosehip in the other mask so i prefer not even used differently and we mix this time too finally we add two drops of lavender essential oil you can also find this in herbal medicine the mask is ready for use and here we are again to apply another face mask this time the mask is much larger than the previous one we made with rosaline powder i was born and it is much more purifying because c'it is also the clay in a lavender essential therefore in similar ingredients but the purpose of this mask is certainly different if you want it more delicate in case of a blog post and insert different flower powders than those used however, i already see i talked during the procedure now i'm going to apply my mask always with the same panel that i have right among the other day, possibly even teaspoon itself is fine and then rinse your face and as i showed you in the other video then this time i won't show it to you anymore i. e. with running water massaging with circular movements in this way the grains that remained of dried lavender flowers will make a very light and delicate exchange now i just have to let the mask act for 10 15 minutes and then rinse a face you see not put even a little bit in the part under the chin because in any case also in this area check some small black points and then this mask is very purifying see you later and here i am or highlighted the face and dried with a clean and dry cloth being the skin really soft purified luminous very very fresh much fresher than the mask of the another time this because there is the extension of lavender and the clay take the other mask that we made these two events were not there will make it much more nutritious so in my opinion the one even more suitable for the summer period so to me this mask like it a lot as i repeat to you for substitutions and omissions i leave you the link in the information box that's all and see you next time bye",

        "video_sub_title": "studies have shown many positive health benefits of using essential oils but a question i often see is do they help with breathing now that my friend is exactly what we're going to talk about in this video are you ready let's go first and foremost what is an essential oil an essential oil is a concentrated liquid that contains chemical compounds and substances that are derived from plants these compounds do offer many great health benefits and we're going to talk about some of those here in this video but before we get into it just know that essential oils should never be used as the main treatment for asthma or any medical condition unless instructed by your physician please check with your doctor or medical professional before purchasing or consuming essential oils this video is for entertainment purposes only so now that we got that out of the way you may be wondering what are the benefits of using essential oils and there are many different types of essential oils all with different health benefits in general here are some of the health claims that are associated with using essential oils they have been said to boost energy levels aid in digestion calm your nerves and relieve stress increase your ability to focus improve and treat your skin improve your mood and relaxation reduce anxiety treat headaches and nausea fight infections boost immunity help with depression and many many more with that said in this video we're only going to focus on how they can help promote the health of your lungs and provide breathing support which brings on the question can essential oils help with breathing to give a brief answer yes they certainly can but it's typically in an indirect way allow me to explain essential oils don't provide bronchodilation effects meaning that their components don't directly help to open up the airways of the lungs for better breathing now with that said essential oils do provide aroma therapy which has calming effects this can be beneficial for those with asthma and here's how asthma is a condition that typically gets worse when anxiety levels and stress are increased the aromatherapy effects that come from essential oils can help to decrease stress and anxiety which in turn can indirectly help make breathing easier essential oils have also been found to provide anti - inflammatory effects which may also be beneficial in treating asthma in some people so just to give a quick recap yes essential oils can help with breathing but just know that it's in an indirect way so now you may be wondering what are the best essential oils for your lungs i'm gonna mention a few that you may consider experimenting with after doing your own research and of course first checking with your doctor so first there is lavender according to a study from pubmed breathing in diffused lavender essential oils may help reduce inflammation that is caused by asthma and allergies next is eucalyptus this essential oil can help loosen up mucus so that it can be expected more easily this essential oil can help in silencing a cough as well in fact it's an ingredient that can be found in many over - the - counter medications another good example is peppermint which is an essential oil that can be used as a combatant for sinus congestion next up is rosemary this essential oil has components that helps to relax the smooth muscle tissues of the trachea which makes breathing easier a studies show that rosemary oil can reduce asthma symptoms in people who didn't see improvement from traditional treatment and last but not least there is lemon this essential oil can help provide a boost to the immune system and help you get over a common cold more quickly these are just a few examples of some of the essential oils that provide lung benefits for breathing support if you're interested in learning more on this topic we have a detailed article on our website if you want to check that out i'll drop a link down below in the description now you may be wondering how to use essential oils for breathing the best way to do so is with a diffuser which is a device that disperses essential oils throughout the entire room so that the particles can easily be inhaled now you may be wondering if a diffuser is required for essential oil consumption while they're technically not required they are recommended simply because of how well they work for breathing however there are some other techniques for using essential oils that don't require a diffuser here is an example you can place a few drops of an essential oil in a tissue or in the palm of your hand then simply cup your hand over your face be sure to exhale first and then slowly inhale the vapors of the essential oil without tensing or making a sniffing sound then you can repeat this process for about five to ten inhalations another method is to apply the essential oil directly to your body in key spots that are close to your nose some examples include the collarbone under your ears on the temples and along the jawline just be sure not to ingest the essential oils or get them directly into your eyes nose ears or mouth keep in mind that each person is different meaning that different essential oils may have different effects on different people what works well for you may not work well for me and vice versa but most people will experience some type of positive breathing and lung benefits after consistent use but if you're watching this video now and you are having breathing issues you should know when it's important to see a doctor as i previously mentioned essential oils should not be the main source of treatment for any medical condition essential oils are generally considered safe to inhale or apply through the skin but they should not be directly swallowed when they're used for minor health problems essential oils are likely harmless as long as they're used as a complementary form of therapy however if you do have a serious health condition you should speak with a health care professional before use in general you should consider seeing your doctor if you have breathing difficulties or eickhoff that causes any of the following signs and symptoms high - grade fever shortness of breath wheezing and bronchoconstriction a cough that produces blood or a drastic weight loss so just to recap if you're experiencing any of these signs and symptoms especially if you have an underlying respiratory condition this is when you should consider seeing your doctor in order to get professional medical advice so there you have it now you have a good understanding of how essential oils can be beneficial for not only your lungs but for your overall health keep in mind that some essential oils including the ones that were mentioned in this video can trigger allergies in some people and actually make breathing more difficult this is why it's important to do plenty of research and always talk to your doctor about the potential benefits and risk before using an essential oil with that said as long as they're used correctly essential oils can provide support for a coffee breathing difficulties and for your overall health if you thought this video was helpful if you don't mind do me a huge favor and hit that like button to support the channel i want to know what is your favorite essential oil leave it down below in the comment section and while you're here you might as well go ahead and subscribe if you videos one more thing if you want to dive deeper into essential oils and learn more about their effects on the lungs and respiratory system we created a full guide on our website that i think will be useful for you it even lists out and provides reviews for some of the best essential oils that are available for purchase on the market today if you're interested i will drop a link to the article right below this video down below in the description that's it for this one thanks again for watching and i will see you in the next video and as always breathe easy my friend [ music ]",

        "video_sub_title": "hey it's tim fraticelli here with pt progress and in today's video i'm going to show you how to fix rounded shoulders with five really easy moves look these are absolutely my favorite exercises for fixing rounded shoulders because not only do these movements help to improve shoulder range of motion but they also help to improve thoracic mobility so that we can fight against this hunchback posture that comes with this rounded shoulders so the first movement can be done at any wall or door and it's a variation of the wall slide that you might have seen in the past and i love the wall slide as an exercise for relieving shoulder pain but when you add this extra component to the wall slide it really emphasizes improved thoracic mobility and upward rotation of the scapula which is really important and exactly what we need if we're trying to fix rounded shoulders i'm going to start with my hands at the wall about shoulder width apart and while keeping my head in a neutral position i'll slide my arms up the wall and perform a small lift off the wall now bring your arms back to the wall and slide them back down to complete the first repetition of 20. now this movement alone may be enough to tire out your shoulders and your mid - back because those are the muscles that are probably weak and by strengthening them we can work out of that rounded shoulder posture and fix the problem for good and there are some really great ways to progress with this exercise especially if you have any of those flat resistance bands like this you can stand on one end and glide your hands up along the wall for some added resistance which really helps to engage the rotator cuff and the lower trapezius muscle the group of muscles that will help to keep your shoulders back in the right place my buddies bob and brad sent over some of their famous pt resistance bands which are on par with any of the other bands that i've seen out there the expensive ones even except these are like half price which is awesome so you can see those in the description below the second move to fix your rounded shoulder posture is to address the tightness that's in your chest with an active press and stretch technique now you can do this with a tennis ball or a dog toy or a lacrosse ball like i have here and then place it against the side of your pec between your chest and your armpit now some people will prefer to do this on the ground but you can also perform this in standing as well the goal here is to apply some pressure into the ball as you work your shoulder into flexion and external rotation not only does this stretch the pec but it also works the muscles that help to flatten out your shoulders and to fix your posture for the long term try to perform 10 to 15 repetitions of this movement two to three times a day oh by the way if you're new here welcome to the channel we post practical videos about physical therapy career treatment and products to relieve your aches and pains so if that sounds interesting and you're finding this video to be helpful please consider subscribing to the channel okay the next movement that we're going over today is called eyes wise and t's and i like to perform this movement over a bench or an exercise ball if you're looking for even more of a challenge the idea is to make the letters i y and t with each movement and this really targets the muscles of the mid - back that helps to pull your shoulders back from that rounded position that they're in i count each sequence as one repetition so by the time you're done working through 10 rounds you've done 30 movements in total and you'll really feel the shoulders working after this exercise you can make it a little easier by doing this at the wall and even progressing it by using a resistance band or a one to two pound dumbbell okay i absolutely love this stretch the fourth movement here is a combination of a pec stretch and a lat stretch using a foam roller and if you don't have a foam roller you can just roll up a pillow but honestly if you have been dealing with rounded shoulders for a while a foam roller is going to work wonders for your posture and the way i use it is by laying down on it lengthwise and placing my shoulders in a w position i could hold this position for 20 to 30 seconds to get a great pec stretch and i can make even more use of this stretch in the position by targeting my lats the best way to do that is by bringing your elbows in and driving your hands behind your head as you try to point your elbows to the sky you're going to feel a stretch along the lats which is great because oftentimes this muscle becomes very tight pulling you further into that rounded shoulders posture and if you're not already doing this fifth movement to fix your rounded shoulders you absolutely have to give it a try and that exercise is the diagonal band movement i love this movement because we can challenge the rotator cuff the mid trap and the low trap and work the shoulders through a full range of motion with progressive resistance and if you're not sure what progressive resistance training is i'll teach you that in the video up here now the diagonal band movement is great you simply hold the band in front of your body and lead up and out with your arm into full flexion at about 30 degrees be sure to lead with the thumb up because this opens up the shoulder and avoids pinching and popping i like to alternate the movements and aim to perform about 20 of these at a time 10 on each side now with all these movements i do like to perform these in sequence because it gives you a nice variety of stretching and strengthening and it really loosens things up enough for me to achieve that full range of motion while strengthening and supporting the muscles through the range just know that it's going to take some consistency to make a noticeable change with your posture you can't do this routine once and expect the problem to be fixed forever so work through this routine throughout your day for the next couple of weeks and let me know if you have any questions in the comments below hey if you found these tips to be helpful let me know by giving this video a little bit of physical therapy by hitting that like button and consider subscribing to the channel for even more videos thanks for watching and we'll see you in the next one",

        "video_title": "Dr. Gregory Abbas: The Proper Use of Nasal Spray HD",
        "video_sub_title": "[ music ] we can go ahead and show some proper techniques when you're prescribed a nasal spray it could be any one of the sprays there's several out there but the proper technique is when you get the bottle that you prime it first some bottles actually are inhaled actually are a metered dose inhaler so you prime it it's like a it's a puff that comes out and so that those are some that can be using those this is a liquid based product some you have to shake some you don't so it usually tell it recommends that you shake this particular one and it's a flonase based product and you prime it basically you push down on it to get the mist first so that you know that there's going to be medication in there okay and a proper way to to to spray this in is to put your head down like this pull your nostril out with one hand so my left nostril i'm going to spray with my right hand but i'm pulling my nostril out with my left finger okay now one mistake that many people make is that when they spray it they snort it in and so when you spray it and snort it guess where it's going to go it's going to go into your throat mediately and you're going to taste it and you're not going to like it and it's not going to be as effective because it's not staying where it needs to stay okay so when you spray it you don't inhale you let the medication go in the nose and then if you need to sniff back a little bit so it doesn't drip out the front then you do it after you put the spray in okay so once again you might need to sniff a little bit to keep the medication up in the nose proper angle is up and slightly out so it's almost towards the corner of your eye where you're trying to get where you're trying to get that angle okay now i see a lot of people use use the right hand to spray both sides and so what happens is that if you're right - handed the angles perfect for spraying your left side it's not perfect for spraying your right side what happens is that you end up spraying right onto the wall that septum which we talked about earlier the wall that divides the left and the right side of your nose and if the spray collects there it tends to cause an irritation it can cause bleeding so that's where we get into bleeding issues with some of these medications the proper technique for spraying the right side is head down you pull out with your right you pull your right nostril with your right finger and you spray just the opposite with your left hand and you might need to sniff again after you put the spray in sniffs lightly keep the medication in the nose okay so that's the proper way of using a nasal by using a nasal spray",

        "video_sub_title": "my name is ben i'm 63 i've just had a bilateral stage tka approximately seven weeks ago i had the left knee total knee replacement done and approximately three weeks ago i had the right knee total knee replacement done one of the things that i realized early on was that there is this anomaly that seemed to occur at nighttime pain seemed to come out of nowhere for no reason at all can able to keep me up at night i can take pain meds that help some but it was still very frustrating i want to show you a way that i found very helpful in controlling that nighttime pain it's sort of like the phantom pain that vets got when they had a limb lofting you have nerve endings that don't really know quite what they're supposed to do here's what i want you to do first of all we need to understand one of two things what stage are you at in your tka for instance if you have staples or stitches still in your leg i want you to take something could be a bandage i like white paper towels you just put that around your leg couple pieces of tape on it and then take something it's just this plastic self - sticking wrap i always call it poly vinylidene chloride none but itself sticking i'm just doing one wrap you want to wrap several reps on there now the reason for the paper towel is that the paper towel is a wood product containing lignin lignin is an antibiotic so if you sweat or something like that we don't want to turn any terms so forth so the paper towel absorbs moisture and it will tend to kill any microbes that are around there now if you don't have an open wound for instance in my case my right leg i've had three weeks of healing there are no open wounds so here's what i do usually about 2 : 00 a. m. the pain gets me wakes me up i can't figure out you know why me you know what's going on i take a hand cream any kind of hand cream will do just kind of lather it around that knee area wipe it off now take your handy dandy ramp and we're going to wrap that real good take it and wrap it once and you notice i'm wearing compression socks to help alleviate venous stasis okay now i may put a couple more rats on this but this is all there is to it you've got some cream on there you've got this self stick wrap and it may be easier to apply with a smaller tube but you leave this on you will find that you can now probably get to sleep you may need a little pain medicine but what happens is the smooth surface takes away the irritation and the stimulation on the various surfaces of your your knee where it's very sensitive so you're not transmitting those strange signals back to your body and trying to get your body to process them and put them in the right place so we bypassed that mechanism it will make a big difference and i'm only taking the time to do this because it made a huge difference for me i'm still doing this at night for some reason about 2 : 00 a. m. i start getting those strange pains that come out of nowhere so if you'll just apply this tenaciously you will reap the rewards i would recommend using a good self - sticking food service film body kroger's at any grocery store or you can use plastic from maybe a dry - cleaning clothes but they don't tend to stay wrapped as well you also notice you have another benefit when you wake up in the morning your leg will be more pliable and that knee joint will be more flexible so you'll have several trade - offs there i hope this has been as helpful to you as it was to me because the strange nighttime pain can drive you crazy at times and i want to help you get through this i'm now in my seventh week and i've had both legs done but i'm still battling these little gremlins that come up and i want to share my solutions with you as i find them thank you and enjoy this",

        "video_sub_title": "hey guys dr. berg here in this short video we're going to talk about the three factors that affect oxygen and their nutritional factors okay in the body so what happens is we have this condition called acidosis that's different than alkalosis it means your body's too acid so the ph is too low and we're talking about in the blood normally the blood ph should be slightly alkaline and what happens is the ph goes slightly too low okay so we're just talking to small little variations so when your body is too acid your breathing is going to be off you're going to be like you're going to sigh frequently you're going to kind of go just can't get enough air it's air hunger that's one of the big symptoms all right so what do you do basically very simple you take calcium magnesium take it before bed take a little calcium magnesium boom correct the ph the way you get this condition is actually being in ketosis for a period of time now it's not a bad thing to be in ketosis because you're burning fat but ketones are acidic so you always have to offset it by eating more calcium magnesium what i do i consume so much vegetable that i don't have a problem with a loss of calcium okay or i might do some cheese on a regular basis at night but just realize if you're breathing soft you need to alkalize your body with alkaline minerals vegetables or calcium i'm using would be the best thing all right another way to know that you need calcium is or magnesium is if you have cramps and your cats okay so that's acidosis secondly vitamin c deficiencies vitamin c is stored in your adrenal glands and vitamin c allows your body to hold oxygen in the body longer and better and so with the vitamin c deficiency you won't be able to hold your breath very long okay you will not be able to you're going to get out of breath when you climb stairs fast your muscles will fatigue faster without vitamin c especially if you're going up in kind like your legs are heavier but mainly you can't hold your breath for a long time that's adrenal problem but see the adrenal stores vitamin c so you just don't have enough vitamin c to store it so it drops out and you have oxygen problems mainly shows up incline walking up stairs out of breath you know that type of thing all right just make sure that when you take vitamin c you always take it from a food concentrate don't take it from some synthetic pill because the type of vitamin c you're getting from synthetics are just ascorbic acid and that's just one little piece of the vitamin c complex you need the whole vitamin c complex so i like to get it from food base a good source would be the wheatgrass juice powder that actually provides the full vitamin c complex then we get to vitamin e vitamin e deficiencies will create problems with high altitude breathing problems at the top of every mountain top you will see empty bottles of vitamin e because mountain climbers consume a lot of vitamin e to help them climb higher and be able to survive at higher altitude so if you're deficient in vitamin e the muscle tissue in your heart will demand so much more oxygen you'll start getting cramping of the muscles in the heart and so like angina pain chest pain is really a vitamin e deficiency so vitamin e provides the oxygen to the muscle tissue if you're if you have muscle damage from an injury you need vitamin e so vitamin e is really important in recovering muscle tissue and increasing oxygenation of the muscle itself and the heart all right where do you get vitamin e you get it from raw nuts you get it from the vegetables you get it from avocados okay that's what you get you get it from a lot of them you can get it from basically seeds nuts vegetables things like that alright so those are the three factors that you want to look at if you want to increase your oxygen carrying capacity and i will see you in the next video",

        "video_sub_title": "do your eyes ever feel tired, fatigued or even blurry after a day of being on your cell phone, tablet or computer? if so, the truth is, you \u2019 re not alone! with the increasing ways digital devices are consuming our daily lives, you \u2019 re probably experiencing digital eye strain ( also called computer vision syndrome ). digital eye strain is known as the temporary discomfort you feel after two or more hours of viewing a digital device, like your phone or computer. and while it \u2019 s probably no surprise the sun is the greatest source of uv and blue light, what you may not know is that digital devices give off blue light too! in fact, recent studies suggest that an overexposure to blue light can cause early onset cataracts, macular degeneration and disrupt your sleep patterns. according to the vision council, more than 87 percent of americans report using digital devices for more than two hours a day. this puts them at an increased risk for digital eye strain. and guess what, these numbers will probably get worse over time. the reality is, your eyes were not designed to stare at digital screens all day long! therefore, if you have digital eye strain, you may experience headaches, eye fatigue, dry eyes and blurry vision. also, if you neglect to wear the glasses your eye doctor prescribed you or if your work environment is less than optimal, you may experience neck and shoulder pain after a long day of working on your computer. now for many of you, your symptoms may subside shortly after you stop using your digital devices. however, for some of you, your symptoms will continue to persist looong after you put your digital devices away. with this in mind, here are 5 simple ways to prevent digital eye strain! 1 ) make sure to take frequent breaks when using digital devices known as the 20 - 20 - 20 rule, the american optometric association recommends you take a 20 second break by viewing something that is at least 20 feet away for every 20 minutes of digital device use. however, for many of you, it \u2019 ll be challenging to stop what they \u2019 re doing every 20 minutes. therefore, i personally recommend a 5 minute break for every hour you spend on a digital device. regardless of which timeline you adapt, taking scheduled breaks will provide your eyes and brain time to reset so you can tackle the rest of your day! 2 ) get a yearly comprehensive eye exam getting a yearly eye exam will help you stay on top of any vision changes you have over time. especially since uncorrected vision can intensify symptoms of digital eye strain. also, your eye doctor will assess how well your eyes work together as well as evaluate if you have any new or advancing eye diseases. 3 ) modify your work environment bright or poorly positioned overhead lighting can cause unnecessary glare off your digital devices. this glare can cause your eyes to work harder than they have to ( and who wants to do that? ). simple modifications like installing office blinds, turning down your overhead lights or swapping out high wattage for low wattage light bulbs can certainly go a long way! also, make sure your computer is about 4 to 5 inches below your eye level and that you \u2019 re sitting in an ergonomic chair while you work. 4 ) adjust your screen lighting fortunately, many digital devices now have settings that allow you to adjust display lighting and font size. even cooler, apple \u2019 s night shift technology is designed to decrease your exposure to blue light in the evening by using your device \u2019 s clock and geolocation to determine the sunset in your area. this technology automatically shifts the colors in your display from a cooler to warmer light output. the next morning, your device display will automatically return to its regular settings. 5 ) manage your dry eye disease studies show we blink less when read. therefore, it \u2019 s no surprise that staring at digital devices can really dry up your eyes. fortunately, keeping on hand over the counter artificial tears is one simple way to help keep your eyes comfortable and lubricated. eyepromise ez tearsanother option to consider is applying heat to your eyelids for a few minutes each morning and evening. known as warm compresses, performing this daily routine can help activate the glands in your eyelids that naturally release oils onto your eyes. last, but certainly not least, consider taking nutraceuticals like eyepromise\u00ae ez tearstm. this daily supplement works in as little as 1 week, soothes dry, irritated eyes, reduces your need for artificial tears and, if you \u2019 re a contact lenses wear, will keep you comfortable in your lenses. curious if you have digital eye strain is impacting your quality of life? what are you waiting for? make sure to schedule an appointment with a local eye care professional today!",

stomach so i always go for tea now the two teas that i recommend having is one peppermint tea and two ginger tea so with peppermint tea peppermint tea is actually great because it actually helps to relieve the muscles in the digestive system so that's why i recommend having peppermint tea and i think it does wonders and i actually love it so much that i carry it around in my bag with me especially when i go to tropical places like bar or if i go to asia like thailand or somewhere and i actually don't really get on with certain foods when i go to these country so i'll just make sure that i carry a good old bit of peppermint tea in my bag and it helps so i can enjoy all the amazing food that has to offer number two obviously is ginger tea now ginger tea is amazing i recommend having fresh ginger in hot water if you want ginger tea because i think it's better than having a teabag now ginger tea has traditionally been used because because it actually helps to reduce information in this stomach especially if you've got bloating where you feel sick have intentionally is really going to help get rid of the nausea and it's going to help to make the bloating go down in your stomach so now the two teas that i recommend having and of course if you guys have any other suggestions that you feel it's great to have as a tea let me know in the comments below but those are the two teas that i recommend having so tip number two is having a lemon water or coconut oil so this is fine i'll only have when i've woke up in the morning and i'm bloated and my stomach is just doesn't hurt it's just voted and i don't know why so i will go downstairs i will add lemon freshly squeezed into warm water or room - temperature water i actually don't really like having lemon water that much so i would actually avoid having it i mean lemon wood is great and i know loads of people do do it but i personally don't really like the taste of lemon water so i personally will have coconut oil in my tea in the morning or mct oil the reason why i have this is because it's a healthy fat that's actually going to help my digestion get moving in my stomach which is going to help me go to the toilet and flatten my stomach out so coconut oil has amazing benefits anyway but especially if i'm bloated having just a bit in my tea in the morning does really do wonders for me and i couldn't recommend it enough one thing i will say is if you guys are wanting to buy mct oil please do read the back of the instructions and follow the dosages that they say to take because if you have too much of it it actually has the opposite effect and make sure you keep going to the toilet which you guys don't want to do and it can cause stomach pain so just follow the dosage like it says i'm able to now take one big tablespoon of mco in my tea in the morning but you definitely have to build up a tolerance to it and i think when you start you just normally take that one teaspoon and you build yourself up so if you guys like me you're not really feeling the lemon water i want to try coconut oil mct just read the back of it and follow the dosages and you guys will be fine tip number three now i highly recommend doing this it's finding what is bloating you so before people used to always tell me to keep a food diary used to really annoy me because i don't want to write down every single note i'm having but i am gonna tell you it does work and i really recommend keeping a food diary if you suffer from bloating quite often like i used to and sometimes can do now so what i notice with keeping a food diary i actually could establish the type of foods that were bloating me things like onions seem to bite me for some reason definitely gluten gluten really makes me bloat out at the minute and greek yogurt which is really weird greek yogurt just boats me it makes me feel really sick so i can't go near it yogurt which is really annoying but keeping a food diary has helped me notice what is actually triggering me to blow out and obviously in that case i can avoid those certain foods i am someone the process of trying to figure out what foods do bloat me and since i've been on a lower carb diet high protein high fat my stomach does stay flat pretty often but there has been certain meals that i have had recently that have bloated me and i just want to keep track of what they are so as you guys also know i have actually applied to do 23andme which is great i couldn't wait to get the results of that when i do i'm going to extract the data and put it into different tools which can hopefully tell me if i have any sensitivities to certain foods so i'll keep you guys updated on that of course since i find out but definitely track your food find out what is voting you and then you guys know to avoid those foods so you guys don't have a flat stomach on that note if you are bloated i do really recommend to avoid or limit the carb intake and what i mean we can't intake is just you know things like bread pasta or crisps those sort of carbs obviously have need food vegetables because you actually want to get the fiber in your body which is going to help the digestion go through but i would really recommend from staying away from like the processed carbs or refined carbs and on that same topic i would really recommend limiting your dairy intake de dari actually just really isn't that good to have i don't actually drink milk i have like nut milk so i almond milk and coconut not my favorite so i would recommend omitting the darien and take one dataset you are bloated tip number four if you guys are severely bloated which i have had had recently especially when i was in bali i would eat in mail and i too get so bloated that i could get craps my son would be so hard that he actually poke it and again i look pregnant it's activated charcoal now this honestly it was a lifesaver when i discovered this aaron was the one that actually gave it to me because he takes the capsule versions and i have the loose powder version but it's actually amazing especially after you've eaten so what activated charcoal does is it actually sucks up all the uncomfortable acids and gases in your stomach that are causing you to blow out so what i have is i just take one tablespoon put it into water stir it and shut it down doesn't taste amazing but the effects of it are so good that i really do highly recommend taking especially after you've eaten and you just feel really full and you can't move so try activated charcoal if anyone is suffering from bloating straight after once you've taken the activated charcoal will actually help to get rid of the bloating and give you a flat stomach that you guys won and you want to just get back to normality tip number five is probiotics so providers are great because it's actually going to help to balance out your gut bacteria so if you're someone like me who has maybe had gastritis in the past and i actually noticed that got rid of all my good bacteria and that was probably one of the reasons why i was biting out so much so primaries are really gonna help with balancing out the good and the bad bacteria in your body which in then it will actually help get rid of bloating in the future from certain foods so probiotics are going to help you're gonna help to restore the bacteria and balance in your body and there are there are certain probiotics that don't actually work so i would recommend doing your research but one probiotics that i think is absolutely amazing and has worked for me in the past and i'm actually starting it again is bsl - 3 it's really great it's actually sachets that you just put into water in the morning and down it's like bacteria and i think personally that is what has really helped get my butt and got bacteria back to normal and actually helps you have keeney a flat stomach when i eat some foods tip number six is eating whole foods so of course this does kind of lead into the video that i did last week which is avoiding obviously processed refined carbs and sugar so you really do need to follow a diet that is obviously rich in whole foods and especially fiber because all those nutrients minerals and vitamins are going to help get the digestive tract moving which is going to help get the crap out your body and it's going to help relieve any stomach pain that you have bloating and make your stomach go back to normal which is nice and flat so i recommend trying to stick with mainly a diet that's high in fiber and especially things that are like leafy green vegetables i mean things like spinach lettuce kale all those type of foods are really going to help give the nutrients that you've got and digestive tract need and in terms of having any fiber you can get fiber from loads of different things obviously like vegetables anyway but you can actually get them from chia seeds which if you guys want you can add it to smoothies or you can add some to water and of course nuts so they're the two ways that i like to get my fiber intake up for the day and i have been trying out this new shake at the minute by security and i think that's how you spell it i'll let you leave it in the comments below for you but that is a really great shape because the ingredient it's all pure whole food ingredients i have it with almond milk or coconut milk and the fiber is so hot in there that it does really help make me feel great definitely recommend that as a like protein shake or shake if you guys want one one thing i would say is try and steer clear of broccoli and cauliflower if you guys are boaters and it was trying to increase the fiber or vegetables in your diet sometimes those two vegetables can actually have the opposite effect on bloating and make you boat out more and have excess gas so definitely trying to avoid those when you guys are posted and obviously you want to get your fiber intake up tip number seven is sweating it out yes exercise so exercise is actually going to help to make you feel better especially for me if i wake up bloated i love to just go downstairs bust out a workout get my sweat on and i actually feel so much better after i've got a workout and i don'tice that my stomach will be a lot flatter after i have done a workout if for any reason you get up or say after you've eaten dinner and you know you're so full and so bloated that you can't move and you just feel like oh my god doing a worker is the worst thing for me right now that happens to me sometimes and the other thing that i would recommend to do is just going on a walk you know get the digestive tract moving go on a nice walk somewhere doesn't have to be long if you literally be like 15 minutes around the bok bar that's gonna help get the food move you through the stuff and hopefully it pass it through so just go on a walk if you don't want to do an exercise but if you do have the energy to exercise i recommend just doing like a hit session of mine busting it out get your sweat on and now what make you feel so much better because it does for me and finally my last tip number eight is having an epsom salt bath so epsom salts baths operate because the epsom salts actually help to draw out the toxins in the water from your body and obviously the heat from the bath is actually going to help to sweat you out so sweating and getting rid of all these toxins in your body is going to help to actually give you a flat stomach and make the bloat vanish so if i've had a full day of bloating and i just feel like you know i need to relax and get this out of me now i will go into the bathroom have a nice bath with some can i put some epsom salts in there and i just honestly feel so much better when i'm in the bath and especially when i get out i just feel so good after so that is the end of my video guys i hope you enjoyed learning what my top eight tips are for reducing any bloating that you have of course if you guys have any other tips that you want to share let leave them below in the comment section and i will have a rage and give them a try but i hope you guys enjoyed this i will be uploading more videos

        "video_sub_title": "hello ladies and welcome to this tutorial which is for a briar rose bunny which has burn injury trimmings and of the month for july 2012 i never had the long hair community i hope you enjoyed the tutorial and if you like the look for this fun thing keep watching ok so let's start off with the course requirements for this hairstyle you are going to need 3 hair ties in the color of your choice obviously i'm going to use the brown ones because you're gonna need some pins for gripping you can either use a regular hair grips or you can use spin pins i'm probably going to use a combination of both for this one and you're going to need a nice long piece of green ribbon and one of these little clipping roses now normally and these would just be accents to the hairstyle but the whole point of this is that it's the briar rose bun and it's central to the style so you must have these the green ribbon can be any shade of green you like i just i happen to have this one and it needs to be pretty long because it's got to be able to get all the way through your hair so once you've got all those things let's begin as always we're gonna start by detangling your hair i don't know what i've done with my tangle teezer i had it and i put it somewhere probably somewhere safe and now i can't find it it's probably in my bag um but once you do tangles you want to smooth your hair back into a ponytail and secure with one of they say nothing unusual here just a regular page sell you want it to be fairly high up sort of in the middle of your head next you're going to take your green ribbon and you're going to slide it through the ponytail holder like so and just pull it so that both ends of the ribbon are the same links just like that then you are going to split your pain tale into two pieces and preferably it's even as you can get them but it's not it's not a huge deal now with each of these pieces you want to have a bit of ribbon let the ribbon go for the moment and you are going to rope braid each of these pieces and you want to rope braids fairly tightly and make sure that you know which way the rope braid is going because once we finish the rope braid and gotten right down to the bottom you are going to wrap the ribbon around the rope braid in the opposite direction so i'm wrote braiding to my right and once i've got to the end which is here i'm gonna wrap the ribbon around to the left and i want to start with it fairly close to where i began right continue to wrap that around make sure you've got a good holding on the end of your rope break so that it doesn't unravel and i'm just gonna tie that braid off and then do exactly the same thing on the other side so you're going to rope braid your strand of hair and then wrap the ribbon around the rope braid in the opposite direction okay so the next step is to burn these two braids and what we're going to do is wrap the first one around the base like that and just hold that in place with your thumb and bring the other one over the top so this is like when we did the vortex bun you've got one strand on top of the other and this creates a flatter bun and it also creates a wider bun on back of the head so where the ends are going to be in different places don't worry and you just need to bring the ribbons around to finish it off just going to secure the main part of the bun with the spendings spigot pens can be a bit tricky in buns that includes great with ribbons or scarves because you can't push a spin pin through a ribbon in fact i'm stuck here so i'm actually i'm gonna take this one out and i'm going to grab my mirror and just pin the ends into place to make sure that they just just use a few pins and that just holds everything in place no that's a pretty nice bun on its own but just to finish it off take your rose flower there and just stick it in the middle like so and that just finishes it off and yeah i think this is a really pretty hairstyle and it's a lovely way to use your ribbons which is as i mentioned earlier the hairstyle of the month over on the elective for july so i hope you've enjoyed this tutorial i hope you liked the introduction and yes any comments questions anything just leave them below of course if you've got little flyaways i've just noticed i've got them here and you can use a bit of hairspray or some more hair grips just to keep them down and i can join this and i shall see you soon with some more ribbon ideas cheerio",

        "video_sub_title": "hi everyone and welcome back to nurse catherine here welcome back to my channel today i wanted to educate you all on how to take an accurate temperature yes an accurate is key word there in this video i am going to focus on two ways of taking a temperature that is easy for you to do at home if you just have a normal thermometer currently my hospital actually has me taking my temperature twice a day at home and at work to monitor for the symptoms of kovat so this is how i take my temperature using this vix thermometer [ music ] some cowboy [ music ] first you're going to take this part off and there you go you have your thermometer mine comes with plastic coverings but it's only me using it so i'm not going to use a plastic covering but if you're using this between multiple people make sure you are using a plastic covering for your thermometer next for this fixed thermometer is somewhere a little bit different all you have to do is turn it on and you simply then just place it underneath your tongue but make sure you are placing it far back i have seen patients who try to put it like on top of their tongue or like very very shallow in their mouth like right there and it just it will not work that way so make sure you're placing it pretty far back so that was the oral way of checking your temperature you also could do underneath your armpit it's not as accurate but you just simply take the same steps but when you're placing it under there make sure you are getting it very far in there and not just on the outer part here make sure you're placing it right under in the midst and squeezing i do want to remind you that everybody's body core temperature can vary person to person so a fever for you might not be a fever for somebody else but what we base off of in the hospital that i work at is anything above one - hundred point four we consider a fever other than that guys that is it for today's video stay safe please stay away from people wash your hands stay inside and i will see you in saturday's video",

        "video_sub_title": "hi my name is amelia samuels and i'm an active rehab physiotherapist today in this video i'll be taking you through the setup and use of canadian crutches these are also known as forearm crutches if you've sustained an injury that requires you using crutches it's highly recommended that you see a physiotherapist for appropriate assessment and treatment if needed in today's video i'll be taking you through the use of crutches in a partial weight bearing injury and a non - weight - bearing injury your weight - bearing status will be determined by your physiotherapist or by your surgeon if you've had surgery before using your crutches it's essential to check that they're safe for use you need to check the rubber stoppers on the base of the crutches to make sure they're they're not worn or loose it's also essential to size your crutches before using them sizing them can be done by pressing on the button and sliding the telescopic end of the crutches to adjust when standing with the crutches 10 centimeters from the side of the foot your crutch handle should be about level with your hip bone your elbow should be bent about 15 to 20 degrees and the elbow support should be situated about 3 to 4 fingers below the point of the elbow at times it may be necessary to use a non weight - bearing gait pattern in a non weight - bearing gait pattern the injured leg is not having any way to put through it to use crutches in a non weight - bearing fashion from this position you'd be putting the weight all on your good leg and then bringing the crutches one step length in front of you you're then putting your weight through your arms shifting your body weight forward and bringing the good leg up to in line with the crutches so to repeat that bringing the crutches forward bringing the good leg up to meet the crutches as you get more confident you may be able to bring the good leg past the point of the crutches this is a more fluid movement but you should avoid any big hopping movements this can throw you off balance when using crutches to walk in a partial weight bearing fashion the goal is to use the crutches to d load the engine structures to allow for healing having said that it is still important to use your usual gait pattern with your injured leg this means as you step through putting your heel first and then your toes to push off in the same way you would when you're normally walking so as you use the crutches from this position you would bring the crutches about a step length in front of you you then bring the injured leg up to meet the crutches and then swing through the good leg to join it in line with the crutches so bringing the crutches forward injure the leg and then bring the good leg up to join it as your confidence increases you can start to swing that good leg past the point of the crutches which gives you a more fluid movement closer to a normal gait pattern so crutches stepping the bad leg forward swing the good leg through remember if you're having difficulty using crutches or if you're feeling unsafe it's recommended that you see your physiotherapist for some further instruction or to practice the techniques",

        "video_sub_title": "and brad the two most famous physicals there is only today hi folks i'm bob short physical therapist brad heinrich physical therapy we have the most famous physical therapist on internet you know kidding of course bob that is your knee pain or anybody's knee pain is really coming from a meniscus tear or from a ligament sprain hotel it's a good question yeah as a matter of fact some people i think you really need to understand mechanics and it's very not that complicated right you dissect it a little bit well that's what we're here for rail defected exactly say no more i sector district never hi say no more but i don't get i'm adding english made all right all right well i'm gonna look at the ligaments first well yeah let's look at the ligaments first because so many people jump right to the meniscus i think because i'm not sure is this more popularly used or something of that nature but if it is a ligament you know someone hurt their knee and you're wondering is that the ligament is it the meniscus or a muscle or is it you know and oftentimes it's you know people here at the acl which one of the four major ligaments of the knee we want to know what all four of them right okay so let's here we've got our knee here that we took from bonaparte leopold lea now you got me saying italian their pulley an appalling ongoing apart so here we got the knee now here at me to hold anything well so far i'm doing good i'm going to take the patella off so thanks the kneecap i have taken that right off yep just get that out of the way so we can look in there okay now we're going to look at this oh this is the left leg mm - hm here's the femur and here's the knee right here for me right yeah i think they can see that down here's the foot obviously so we're going to focus in right on the knee and here you can see here this other knee bends now if you look at the blue kinesiotape we use here because it works well for this those are your this would be your mcl your medial lateral or medial collateral ligament and your lcl lateral lateral okay now the acl and the pcl are in here and i don't know it was really hard it's hard to put tape to represent those so we're going to show you how to test and they're inside and they make they form an x yep song and so you'll see that more clearly as we show you the test now for these ligaments you can see they support lateral motion so this one's your leg can i go this way now this tape is actually stretching now your ligaments are they don't stretch at all right they're very strong and they're attached to the bone and it prevents this from happening or this from happening okay so and then the acl and the pcl bob i've got one little thing here to do and well i do that why don't you man all right by the way if you are new to our channel please take a second to subscribe to us we provide videos on stay healthy fit and pain - free and we upload every day the subscription button should be up here or down here and by the way if you haven't liked us on facebook you're going to want to like us write brad we're likeable people please like us on because i'm in like a vulnerable bob well anyway we're put a happily we're giving away stuff all the time and right now i'm going to put a picture or a photo and it's the napple memory foam lumbar support pillow slash cushion it's for low back pain relief for home office and car use and we're going to be giving away three of these brad can you believe that yeah it's a go - to deal and we're going to do that over the next week or so so all you're gonna have to do is go in and like the picture and and and you're in the contest we make it very simple excellent all right well we're back okay so we talked about the support of the mcl and lcl which support the knee this way now if you look at the knee from the side view we need support so the knee doesn't slip forward or back or backwards so the acl is responsible for forward this dragon so it doesn't allow this to come off and then you would have a big problem get short and hurry and then the pcl posterior cruciate khurshid like right yeah it prevents it from going this way so we got support this way we've got support this way and now that i've got the knee apart but we might as well look at the meniscus so those are the four ligaments that you know that's the problem there's only four ligaments holding the e together and that's why each one is so crucial exactly so exactly so then we got the the cushions between the joints right right which is we're calling obviously the bone between the bones which is your meniscus and the meniscus is attached to the tibia the lower part and i've got it read here and in real life it's actually white okay but this shows up much better and you got the lateral side in the medial aspect of the meniscus and it's shaped their shape kind of like general and medial i'm sorry sorry i've got the leg mixed up but the shape kind of like a horseshoe and actually if i were to did a better job cut my construction paper you would see that here but the big thing is is you know where they are and when they come together that that's now we can't put them together like they're i need to go ahead like that there you go the femur actually squishes down on there and there's a cushion between the two bones and that's part of the job of the meniscus so well you can see if one of these gets torn and even flips up like this you're going to block the motion yep and and it's going to be painful right and your knees not going to be able to move exactly some of the tests are designed to pull out very good off let's go to the letter to lay down bob turn i'm gonna grab a pillow yeah grab a pillow to go down here seem to be worried about my comfort brad no not really should i'm complaining flat i'm not that we'll go ahead lay down i'm not that way with my patients bob i care about them okay let's bring this leg up all right okay now i'm going to do show you the test on the lcl and the mcl you want to grab that again bob so those are the ligaments on the side right beside ligaments these tests are relatively easy to do but they take a feel and we're the knees here we want to test a mate see if it's structurally sound in that direction they're easy to it relatively easy to do but if you haven't done this on a number of legs you don't have the right right right demonstrated to you i don't suggest that you do it but when you go to see a therapist or doctor you're going to know why they're doing it and understand it and maybe even ask for them exactly why don't you come over this way bob i'd like to have a patient you're close to the edge i bring their leg off i have them relaxed i put a slight bend in the knee and what i'm going to do here then you get over here i don't do it this way but so you can see what i'm doing one hand is here and one hand is here and i slightly bend the knee and i'm going to pull in underneath here and support here and go like this and actually i can you won't be able to see this but i can feel there's some play in bob's knee you feel it bob yeah a little bit kind of fun now that's the lcl the outside one now i'm going to do the same test i'm going to push this direction while i support the knee with a slight bend a netbook ten degrees and it is kind of neat and there's not a lot of effort it's very little strength needed if someone has a complete tear of one of these ligaments like my instructor said it's like a barn door opening light up you can do this you don't feel that that resistor that resistance the best way to do this if you've got a sore knee on the right test the good knee first ain't exactly going to feel for how they are on the good knee then you'll know and more that you know if two knees are healthy they're going to feel similar and if you got to complete there it's going to be pretty obvious maybe a little painful too and these tests should not create any amount of pain if they are you don't do them right now let's go to the acl and pcl sure okay i mean there's a number of ways to do this i'm just going to show you two simple ways i have the patient sit or lay down like this and then i sit right on their foot right here and i'm going to bring your pant leg up bob so we can look at shaniqua d you go again he's just he's pulling that that lower bone forward exactly yeah look at this so i can hold this part yeah i'm going to pull his tibia this way if the acl is torn i'm going to get quite a bit of motion yeah subluxation this way and i'm going to go the other direction to test the pcl okay now i told anterior drawer because it's like you're pulling on a drawer exactly an anterior means forward version and sometimes right here i'll push my finger my thumb's in right on the joint line which is just below the kneecap which takes a little practice to know where that is true so don't expect you can feel that and then i'm going to come under here put my thumb's in the joint line so i can feel the translation between the don't drink and i'm going to pull this way and you know bob doesn't have a lot of place some people that are lacks you can do this and they'll go you can feel that bone move and it kind of goes clunk clunk and that'll normal can almost see it even yeah exactly again do the good knee first you go to the route then you go back to the the knee the injured knee and assess carefully and then you're going to push this direction on the tibia this way and push and you know i don't know if i've ever seen a pcl because they're not that calm no they aren't i haven't actually i think i did once when i was a student and i was a long time ago then you can push in this direction and the translation will go this way but it's going to be solid this way there's a lot i'm not going to go to the lachman's it's common when i it's probably more commonly used by therapists and doctors but we're going to skip that because i'll get to the meniscus test now if if everything feels similar on both sides you're thinking long clear and after you do these you're around like it can whip do these tests pretty quick yep exactly okay now the meniscus why don't you stay down bob all right these are the meniscus tests i do laying down and i think they're a little harder to do for the average person i wouldn't recommend it i'm just going to show them to you so that you know what may be done in the clinic sure why don't you put this leg down do you overdo the macmurray's yep okay absolutely so we start here and we do a rotate and push in one dragon and the person needs to be relaxed and that's checking the lateral meniscus open up and here and then go the opposite direction there's i'm making a kind of a circle that's neat in over his other leg and then we're do the same thing out this way and let it drop and i usually put my fingers on the joint line right in here yeah i can feel whether or not yeah just looking i don't have a good feel for this one i like to a please test which i'll do next sure or the other one that does the drop test right where you just keep let it go straight in and then the patient or you have to relax right just plop it down like that and you're expecting pain right yep and this one have you used this one i have not i know we demonstrated this happen before yeah and i don't use this funny that i really doesn't hurt if you don't have a good deed i like the weight - bearing ones in this app we want to like because there's the weight right right i put you want to lay on your stomach laughter okay so normally on this one let's put this leg down i'll roll up a towel and put it right here to keep the kneecap from banging into the the table or not being by pushing it to it's uncomfortable or i'll have the person lay down slide down to the edge of the table i'm not going to do that cuz i don't want to get out of the end of the screen so we're going to pretend i've got that towel roll there and i'll push down rotate the knee in and come this way and then i'll rotate the toe the other direction push down and push push push when it'll lock up it'll be painful and if if it feels as good as the other leg again to the good leg first you know that's a negative sign if you feel pain or some lacking it's a positive sign okay bob let's get up and let's do one more a couple more yeah well we sure want that that you could do yourself pretty easy we have these these are okay the fistly test that's that name that yeah not sure if i've got that right right this is the disco right a disco test you just if you face that way bob lay off it's this way let's do it on our left leg you stand on your left leg you bend the knee a little bit five degree and you're twisting and if that hurts yeah we can we should bring julie in there and see if she's got a bad knee and then you can go down to 15 degrees which is a little bit more but you know you're not going lay down this fire on this test so it's against that twisting you all she did is really grinding the patella to you know the meniscus to exact matter of fact my friend this is a test i used on him and he was positive both this one and the next one which is the duck walk yeah yep and so we were like this yeah they like tolls rotate out bend the knees down in a deep squat and you try to walk yeah believe me you're grinding the knee on that one yep or you can do a zappos pointed in and he was tested positive on both these standing wins and we did it right in his office and i said you should get to a doctor he did hit meniscus he had surgery already next actually he's rehabbing it right now so yeah it works while that tests easy to do on your own soul exactly all right folks thanks for watching good luck with those knees whether acl pcl or meniscus or you know the other thing bob that we really been working on and this is more important than the knee is that broken heart broken higher there you go we'll get we'll get on it yeah thanks you",

        "video_title": "How To Suppress Your Appetite Naturally | Hunger Hormone Science | Weight Loss",
        "video_sub_title": "- though it might not seem like it, we actually have control over our appetite to some degree. in this video we'll be discussing the science of hunger and appetite and the corresponding hormones, and how you can use this science to feel less hungry while on a weight loss journey, while improving the health of your metabolism at the same time. the experience of hunger resides mainly in our brains, specifically in the hypothalamus, an ancient brain region involved in instinctual processes such as sex, sleep, thirst and obviously appetite. key hormones in your body communicate with the hypothalamus to either cease or initiate eating behavior depending on many different factors. these include leptin, ghrelin, insulin, glucagon, and others like peptide yy and cholecystokinin. because hunger isn't as simple as an empty stomach, our behavior and most importantly what we eat actually has a huge impact on how hungry we are. this means we can actually control our appetite to some degree, and we can do so through managing our hunger - regulating hormones through what i'll call the 3 pillars of appetite control. one, blood sugar management, two, slow - absorbing foods, and three, healthful behaviors. stabilizing your blood sugar is the fastest way to real in and out of control appetite. when your blood sugar is stable, free from huge peaks and valleys, the result is sustained energy and a better connection with your real hunger cues. the hormone insulin is the major determinant of how stable your blood sugar is. the more insulin your body releases in response to a meal, the more unstable your blood sugar will be and the faster you'll feel hungry. insulin has been called the fat storage hormone but more accurately its job is to direct energy from the food you've eaten into your cells for fuel. it's released in response and even in anticipation of meals in varying degrees depending on your individual body and the macronutrient you're eating. sugar and refined carbohydrates result in a massive insulin response from our bodies, and this effect is amplified if we pair them with little to no other macronutrients. these foods were not available to our ancestors, so it's a little bit unnatural for us to be eating them especially in the quantities and formats that we do today. when we eat foods like this they are digested so quickly that they produce such a massive insulin response that too much of our available calories get forced into our fat cells for storage. when this happens, not enough calories remain circulating in our blood to be used as energy by our body. without available energy, our body cranks up the demand for food and turns down our desire to move so that we conserve energy, meaning we're hungry again faster than we should be and the food we just ate has been turned into fat even though we needed it available in the blood for energy. refined carbs equal white bread, pastas, white rice, and the most - refined carbohydrate of all, table sugar. if you're wanting to feel fuller longer, consider these foods your worst enemies. they're absorbed so quickly by our bodies that they send our insulin and blood sugar skyrocketing, only to come crashing back down, leaving us prematurely hungry, unable to focus and sometimes shaky and irritable too. interestingly many people start their day with this energy roller - coaster all the time. the most popular breakfast foods are mostly refined carbs after all. people have different insulin responses to different foods. studies have shown that some lucky people can eat a cupcake and get only a moderate insulin response, while others get a massive insulin response from even slow - digesting carbs. you really have to pay attention to how foods make you feel. everybody reacts differently to different foods. i can't emphasize this enough. for a general idea of how different carbs are likely to affect blood sugar levels, we can take a look at the glycemic index which i'll link below. not surprisingly, the research says that the consumption of anything listed as a high gi carbohydrate may increase hunger and promote overeating relative to the consumption of items with a lower gi. pillar number 1 manage your blood sugar by staying away from refined carbs and simple sugars. if you find it really hard to give up refined carbs while on a diet, remember that you don't have to. you can lose weight just counting calories, but you're gonna have a much easier time sticking to a diet if you're not starving all the time, and your blood sugar levels will be stable so you should feel a lot better and more energized as well. if you are going to eat them, try pairing them with another nutrient and sticking with smaller quantities. this will slow down your digestion a little bit and is healthier for your metabolism overall. again, you may just be one of those people who only has a mild insulin response to refined carbohydrates, but generally feelings of hunger and issues with body weight are indications otherwise. but again, everybody is totally different, so you really have to pay attention to how you feel. pillar 2, slow - absorbing foods, protein, fiber. so what should we eat then? well, basically the opposite of refined carbs. foods that digest slowly produce stable blood sugar, long - lasting energy, a reduced insulin response, and also impact our hunger - regulating hormones in a positive way. starting with protein, protein is the most difficult macronutrient for the body to break down, so it takes the longest. in a quote taken directly from sciencedirect, \" many studies show \" that dietary protein is the most satiating macronutrient, \" since protein may affect appetite \" by its involvement with appetite - regulating hormones. \" glucagon and peptide yy are two key hormones impacted by protein intakes. glucagon is the inverse hormone to insulin. it's released when blood sugar levels become low and it helps us pull fat out from storage to be used as fuel. meanwhile, peptide yy is similar to leptin in that it tells our brain we're not hungry and is linked to a decreased motivation toward food. researchers studying adolescent girls found that a high protein breakfast not only resulted in greater feelings of fullness throughout the day, but a reduction in evening snacking compared to controls. increasing protein to 30 % of your daily total caloric intake has been shown in a ton of different studies to reduce calories consumed over the course of the day overall. i've just included the one study, but there are a ton, and honestly in nutritional science it's very, not rare, but it's not often that there's so much of a consensus that doing something will get a certain result. so i'm very confident in telling you that if you increase your protein intake, you will feel more satiated. fiber, fiber promotes fullness in a bunch of different and beneficial ways. first it slows the absorption of nutrients into our bloodstream. it's the reason high fiber fruits and vegetables with low carbohydrates don't impact our blood sugar the way fiberless refined carbs do. second, the volume of food we eat at a meal impacts satiety both psychologically and physically through stomach stretch receptors that sense when we have enough food in our bellies. even the increased degree of chewing required to eat foods high in fiber has been shown to increase perceived fullness. studies show that fiber increases satiety, decreases hunger, and reduces daily overall caloric intake. fiber is also digested in the deeper chambers of our intestines. refined carbs are broken down in the first chamber while fiber makes it all the way through, stimulating peptide yy and cholecystokinin, two key hormones that tell us we are not hungry, in the process. interestingly in patients who have gastric bypass surgery, those who have a type called roux - en - y typically experience the most weight loss. hey guys, sorry i messed this part up. so i forgot to mention that the reason that patients experience more weight loss with roux - en - y as opposed to other types of weight loss surgery is because the stomach is reconfigured so that food misses the first part of the small intestine completely and is instead digested in the deeper layers. this is really similar to what happens to us when we eat fiber, so that's why this bit is here. this is thought to be the result of key changes in their hunger hormones stemming from this deeper intestinal digestion, the same hunger hormones that we can stimulate through a healthy intake of fiber. so i just thought that was an interesting and useful point. pillar 3, healthful behaviors, sleep, exercise, stress management. to get the most out of the other two pillars, you should also engage in other keystone healthy behaviors, adequate sleep, regular exercise, and stress management. if you don't, it's really like fighting an uphill battle. our overall health and our body weight are linked, and our hunger hormones are one of the key pathways that this occurs through. sleep, inadequate sleep massively affects our hormones, and in particular those involved with metabolism and hunger. as a result, studies show that individuals running on less than six hours of sleep per night report an increased sense of overall hunger and an attraction to high carb, high calorie foods. lack of sleep directly impacts the hunger hormones leptin and ghrelin, decreasing leptin and increasing ghrelin. so if you've ever found yourself hungry all day for no particular reason, not enough or poor quality sleep may be to blame. poor quality sleep has been called a potent psychological stressor, and as a result, also increases the stress hormone cortisol. stress in our lives expresses itself internally largely through cortisol, which has far - reaching effects on our health far beyond waking, but we limit the discussion to appetite here. cortisol increases reported food cravings and overall intake of high calorie foods, which seem to truly offer a comforting effect through the release of feel good serotonin. it's helpful to realize that, you know, although we don't have control over the stressors that might pop up in our lives, we do control our stress response and how we react to those stressors internally. worrying about past or potential events for example is something that we do have total control over. a lot of people don't realize that indulging in these types of negative thoughts is a choice, and although it can be extremely difficult especially at first, we are in control, and we can choose not to engage with these types of thoughts. meditation is a great way to work on your relationship with your thoughts and how you think about them, something called metacognition. exercise, exercise is also a great way to lower your cortisol while at the same time providing some other hunger hormone benefits. it's been shown to decrease levels of circulating ghrelin while increasing peptide yy and resistin. in one study overweight adolescents were put on an aerobic workout program for 32 weeks. the researchers found that exercise training increased total pyy and decreased resistin. these are favorable changes, as pyy plays a role in decreasing appetite, and resistin is linked to insulin resistance. it should be noted also that the exercise appetite link is somewhat controversial, and in some people some types of exercise might actually induce hunger. controlling your appetite or suppressing your hunger sounds like some sort of like sketchy diet ad benefit, but all the tips i've given you today actually make you healthier. they're improving your metabolic health so you can get in touch with your real hunger cues and feel more satisfied with what you're eating. if your blood sugar is all over the place, if your hormones are out of control because of what you're eating, not gonna feel good and it can be hard to stick to a diet if you're essentially fighting your biology the whole way. thank you guys so much for watching this video. i hope you enjoyed it, and next week i am finally ready with my \" foodie beauty \" video. so i think it's one of my favorite ones i've made to date, so i'm really excited to show you guys and i hope everyone is safe and doing well during this really crazy time.",

        "video_sub_title": "finally a breakdown for you on how cheat meals truly work and how leptin is really responsible for what's going on with our body's metabolism i'm going to break down the science of left and i'm going to break down the formula that you can use to get the most out of your cheat meals to break through the plateaus that are absolutely driving you crazy right now but first let me describe what leptin is if it lept into something that's secreted by your fat cells okay so it's secreted by your fat cells and that essentially sends a message to the brain telling the brain that you're either hungry or you're not hungry now how exactly does it work in the body well you see it comes down to being like a gas gauge you see leptin operates as a gas gauge for the brain to see how much fat is on hand here's how it really works step by step the fat cell releases leptin the leptin goes into the blood and travels to the brain then it tells the brain hey brain this guy has enough fat on hand don't worry about it you can go ahead and turn up the metabolism and burn some fat no need to eat more food okay but then if you have low levels of leptin those low levels signal the brain and say brain this guy is low on fat he's low on leptin you need the signal to eat more food and you need to hold all of the fat burning process and halt the metabolism so that this guy doesn't die of famine that's the overall simple breakdown of how it works you see what it comes down to when you go into more detail is that there's different things that signal leptin for example obviously having more fat on the body is going to signal more leptin it's going to mean that the body can eat more food and the body can burn more fat and have more metabolism but the same thing also happens when you eat a lot of food so if you eat a lot of food in one sitting it's going to signal that left in response the brain is going to go ahead and say okay we've got enough food we can rev up we can burn some fat and crank the metabolism all having to do with how much food you consume at one particular point in time but there are some caveats that you need to understand you see if we have a lot of body fat we're secreting a lot of left and in theory that would make sense that okay then our metabolisms are going to be really really fast and we're never going to be hungry but it ends up becoming quite the opposite you see when you have so much left in being released by so much fat the brain starts to kind of tune it out i want you to think of it like this if the leptin is the phone call to the brain then you have to think of it like a hardwired now what can happen is if you have so much leptin it's almost hard to understand the conversation so the brain just tunes it out think of it like a nagging spouse it's just constantly nagging at you you know you're always joke that eventually he's kind of tuning out it just becomes white noise left and sort of becomes white noise to the brain so even when you have a lot of leptin floating around because there's a lot of fat the brain doesn't register it so it sees you as starving and it tells your body to slow down metabolism and tells you to eat more that's what triggers that death spiral where people gain weight and then they get so overweight and they just continually get hungry and they continually put on weight because their whole signalling system is messed up but what can we do to fix that now that we have an understanding of how leptin really works in the body well it comes down to understanding what the biggest factors to left in resistance are and the first one of course is the obvious one it's being overweight but how do we lose weight if we can't control the leptin first well the next one is actually surrounding inflammation okay you need to eat an anti - inflammatory diet and i have a lot of videos on that and you can look up online what anti - inflammatory foods are but inflammation clouds the brain's ability to see leptin so think of it like a staticky phone line it's like the brain picks it up and it just can't understand what's going on because it's so clouded with inflammation around the hypothalamus this is very very critical if we can start taking action to reduce inflammation then we can receive left and better and have a clearer response from the fat to the brain the other one that's really really important of course is exercise now can be very very tough but getting up and getting going first thing in the morning fasted cardio that kind of thing can help inflammation a lot and help this whole process but the other one is sleep studies are now starting to show that sleep plays a huge huge huge role in our levels of leptin less sleep equals low leptin more sleep equals more leptin and the actual sensitivity and the brain's ability to receive it but now let's get to the nitty - gritty what can you do what about cheat meals what about having the right kind of foods at the right time to help your body see left in the right way first things first we need to reduce our intake overall of carbohydrates and we need to reduce our triglycerides now triglycerides are stored fat essentially being converted from carbohydrates it goes through a process called de novo lipid genesis which i can talk about in another video excess carbs turn into fat fat that has turned into fat from carbs is really a triglyceride triglycerides disrupt the communication of leptin to the brain as well meaning it's slowing down the signaling so if we can start lowering triglycerides yes we can burn more fat it's not just about what's on the blood work if your triglycerides are high you are potentially going to gain more fat but the other thing is the strategic implementation of cheat meals because so many of us are eating way less food and consuming way less calories than we should be it's not just a myth there's legitimate science behind leptin levels and eating too little calories so how many times has this been you you're eating food you're eating healthy food you're not eating much of it is you're trying to restrict calories and you feel like you're just stagnant and sometimes even gaining weight well it's because your body is seeing you as being at a time of famine so it's holding on to and storing on to whatever it possibly can so the implementation of a cheat meal once every week or two weeks structured properly signals leptin and tells your brain hey guys this guy's cool he's totally fine he's got enough food you can turn up the metabolism you have the green light to go ahead and rev it on up and burn some fat that way the brain isn't constantly on standby saying okay all systems are on stop right now we're not burning fat so it's very very critical now what should your cheat meal look like well generally speaking looking at the science your cheat meal should be very low fat high carbohydrate but not high sugar why because starches and glucose signal leptin extremely extremely well even more so than fats and you guys know i'm a big proponent of a low carb high fat diet generally speaking but when it comes to your cheat meals and it comes to your refeed day is you want to get your calories up to at least maintenance and higher and you want to be predominantly from healthy carbohydrates so sweet potatoes of starches parsnips things like that just a high amount of them it's going to signal leptin more than fat would in fact if you have a lot of fat with your cheat meal it will slow down the leptin signaling right then and there we want to get the most that we can out of one cheat meal so if you want to burn fat you need to spike leptin you need to know your body and now that you have an understanding of that communication system it will make a lot more sense so i want to do a lot more videos on this and i need some feedback from you guys i really want you to comment i really want you to let me know what kind of videos of mine you're liking the most i enjoy talking about fat burning i enjoy talking about hormones because i think it's a big big component everyday life but i'm turning to you because i really want to know what you want to hear and i will take them into consideration and i also ask if you haven't already please turn on the notifications for my posts here on youtube and also on facebook that way when you get these notifications you know i've got a new video and you can either first ones to see it and that way you're never missing a beat with my coaching videos and any information i'm trying to parlay to you so as always please keep it locked in here on my channels let's get our left and spice no better time for a nice little cheat meal out of the blue despite the leptin to stop burns and fat so you guys",

        "video_sub_title": "hi this is a tutorial of how to put on your boxing wraps and this technique is really great for beginners because it's very simple very quick very supportive and yeah so there are lots of ways to put your wraps on but i like this one just because it's just really straightforward so what we do is when you open your wraps at one end you are going to have a tassel looks like this a loop and so this is the end we'll be starting with and with the hand that you're wrapping you want to start with your hand something like this so you want to have everything straight and taut so you want to make your wrist bones and your hand bones straight from each other hit like this and make sure that you keep your fingers spread and maintain tension and throughout putting your wrap on this is really important i will remind you about that as we go and so what we do is to start by putting our thumb through here and a good way a good way to start usually is to have the seam of the of the tape here facing upwards and usually if you do it this way you'll find that when you get to the end your velcro facing the right way anybody able to see you're secure your wraps easy if not it's easily solved but i usually do it this way and so you start like this and what we're going to do is wrap our wrist three times so pass over so then the seam is facing down so there three times like this mean you don't want it too tight you definitely need to be able to have circulation so don't do it two sites there's no circulation we do want to feel it snug and you want to make sure it's smooth against your skin to have the maximum support so around one more time there so three or four times days great and then what you do is once you've done that you will pass up through your thumb knuckle here for the support long here and you will pass over and then back down here and then we'll go back across our hand to go around the risk now what you're notice here is already the entire area of my wrist is now covered with with the bandage so that that's given the vital support that's really needed that's really key area for the bandage and this is where we want to make sure basically to the bone in the same place as you punch things and this is what will help you do that so after this you'll do a diagonal say like 1 / 2 x up towards your pinky finger here again trying to keep their bandage as smooth as possible and then we'll wrap our knuckles three to four times that will depend on how you like it wrapped that will depend on the size of your hands and also the length of your bandage that you're working with and i never generally recommend less than four meters but you can get four and a half meters which are the best ones as well as bit more area on that then after you've completed here we will complete our x by passing back down here so the other side of the x back to the wrist and then we'll basically alternate between the wrists and the knuckles to do maybe three or four times around here and then we can go back up to the knuckles again three or four times and again the more you wrap your hands the more you train you all start to feel where you like more support i also like sometimes to do a little bit look like a little cross in the middle like that let's just mean i just like to do that and then you and keep going round your f until you have i would say about about eight at least 810 inches on the end so if you're up here and you come into the end of your bandage then you need to move back down to your wrist and then what we do is your finish off by wrapping the bandage round your wrist bone here and securing the velcro like so so there's a couple of things to notice just at the end is one you don't ever want to move too far down your wrist one it's not an area that we need to add any support to anyway but two it also means that when you train it becomes loose and then your whole wrap will lose its integrity and you won't have the support you need another thing just to notice is if you do get to the end and you find your velcro's facing the wrong way then what you can do is you can literally just turn it over like this so mine's actually the right way but if it was the wrong way then what i would do is i'd literally just flip it like this and then i would click that so you don't need too much tidier of course but you don't need to go back to the beginning to do it again so that is basically i'll do it properly right now and that is basically the simple rap that was great for training will give you all the great support that you need and have i can move my fingers and my farms i have enough space so when i make a fist nothing no blood gets cut off here and and but i also do have the support that i need keeping all my bones and everything in place",

        "video_sub_title": "hi everyone if you're wondering why i sound like morgan freeman well that's because i'm having a cold don't worry i'll be fine well just very oh i will stop today i'd like to show you how i polish this satellite dish into a parabolic mirror before i polish the mirror i tried some other things to make it into a reflector but those failed so i will show you those too so if you want to fail you know how to okay i started by decreasing the whole surface with thinner and then i applied a thin coat of my special hot glue paint once applied i let it dry for two days i elya made a video of how to make this glue paint so we'll put a link in the description i'm using an emergency blanket as the reflector surface then i poured on some hot water to slightly melt the hot glue layer so i could rub the foil onto the satellite dish [ music ] [ music ] you can see here that the result is quite wrinkly and bubbly so i used a hot - air gun to make it a little bit more smooth which kind of work but i still didn't find it a very nice result [ music ] [ music ] then i smooth out the edges and you can see that it has kind of mirror - like properties but i didn't find this results very satisfying [ music ] so it took it all off and now i applied a new piece of foil and only attached it at the sides just by using a piece of baking paper and my flattening iron to just slightly melt the hot glue [ music ] [ music ] then i firmly attached the sides in the same manner [ music ] [ applause ] [ music ] so when i done sucked out some air he became a pretty good parabolic mirror but because of little leaks is hard to keep a constant focal point you can see here that although the photo seems very reflective that let's required an amount of sunlight and you can even see an outline of the trees and the foil soles are quite weak which doesn't make it any easier so then i decided to polish the whole day and to remove the layer of paint i used the heat gun because sanding after pain scratches the aluminum surface too much so then it would be very hard to get a nicely polished surface i used a plastic spatula to scrape off the paint so it wouldn't make any scratches [ music ] [ music ] [ music ] so i started sending with 600 grit waterproof sanding paper don't start with a grid that's too rough because you will later have more work removing the scratches [ music ] then i used 1, 000 grit sandpaper to further smooth in the surface and finally 1200 grit so then i tried polishing it by hand which went pretty well it cost me a lot of elbow grease i used copper polish because it also works very well on aluminum so then i used this polishing disk for my angle grinder and to regulate the speed i used a high - powered dimmer i made earlier [ music ] it polished it pretty well but you can still see a lot of markings so i then attached a piece of cloth to the discredit i rip to see if that would make it a little bit more smooth [ music ] [ music ] it helped a little but the final polish still had to be done by hand [ music ] [ music ] it was a pretty okay result here but i still wasn't satisfied so i used a very fine piece of scotch pad to remove some rough spots [ music ] [ music ] [ music ] [ music ] then i gave you the final polish [ music ] [ music ] and this is the results it's not perfect but it makes a pretty hot spot and if it burns root and it will make steam i've painted the back of the dish black for two reasons the first is because it looks nice and the second because it might radiate off some heat and because there is no such thing as a perfect reflector some of the radiation will be absorbed by the dish and therefore the dish will heat up but this might as well be theoretical nonsense but in any case it's a good story so [ music ] because it's winter the sun is very low so you can imagine how much power it will have in the summer i'm going to use the dish to heat up this aluminium block through which i will vaporize water so it can instantaneously be converted into steam and power my steam engine at least that's the idea so you'll see but that's what i will show you in the next episode okay that's it everyone thanks for watching please like share and subscribe check me out of facebook and instagram and see you next time hopefully always found a bit better",

        "video_title": "The Sounds That Are Unbearable (Misophonia explained)",
        "video_sub_title": "just a note \u2013 this episode contains eating, tapping and clicking sounds. there \u2019 s a fair chance there \u2019 s a sound that annoys you. right? think about what that sound is and then consider this : how does it make you feel? for me, it \u2019 s a sound my mum makes. every night she heats up this weird barley milk drink and stirs her cup with a spoon. really loudly. and it \u2019 s so annoying. so i \u2019 ve been interested in why people have such impulsive and emotional reactions to common sounds. some of us might be irritated, but other people get angry and even distressed. is there more to it? now, my friend molly suffers from misophonia. the term literally means a hatred of sound and it \u2019 s a sound sensitivity syndrome where people have strong emotional or physical reactions to common sounds \u2013 like eating sounds, clicking or tapping, even certain materials rubbing. it \u2019 s easiest for me to start with scraping sounds \u2013 i feel like that bothers a lot of people. so like... that \u2019 s bad. but like... that \u2019 s less bad. and then like... that \u2019 s okay. and it \u2019 s also textural... i feel like a lot of them are quite textural. and when you scrape a rough ceramic alongside a smooth ceramic that \u2019 s a horrible sound for me. and people with misophonia get more than annoyed by sounds \u2013 they experience distress. muscles become tense, hearts race, chests tighten. it actually hurts in my teeth quite a little bit. i get like a weird, it \u2019 s almost a vibrational feeling in the back of my molars. it \u2019 s almost tingle up my neck actually for that one. it feels almost shrill. so why do some people have these reactions? well, one explanation is that their brains are wired to react to sounds differently. in a recent study, two groups \u2013 people with misophonia and a control group \u2013 were asked to lay in an fmri machine. they were played neutral sounds, like rain on a window ; unpleasant sounds, like a baby crying ; and trigger sounds, like someone eating. and when these trigger sounds were played, researchers noticed a big difference between the groups \u2013 in a brain area that helps you spot noticeable things in the environment and pay attention to themprocess your emotions. for those with misophonia, this area went into overdrive and it led to higher activity in other areas of the brains, specifically those responsible for long - term memories, fear and regulating emotions. this hyperactivity suggestsmeans people with misophonia aren \u2019 t processing those particular soundsemotions the way they should and are reacting to them disproportionately... they experience the anxiety of a life or death situation when... it \u2019 s just their girlfriend eating chips. but, how do we know that this hyperactivity doesn \u2019 t happen in all of our brains when we hear something annoying? well, the participants also rated how much the sounds were annoying and distressful. in those with misophonia, while the trigger sounds caused distress, the unpleasant sounds triggered general annoyance but not distress. and the researchers saw this reflected in their brain activity \u2013 people with misophonia didn \u2019 t have the same hyperactive response to unpleasant sounds. though this is one of the only experimental studies on misophonia so it \u2019 s not enough to be certain. we can find some other clues in our behaviour. \u201c well everyone gets annoyed by certain sounds \u201d this is dr. ali mattu, a clinical psychologist with a great youtube channel. \u201c but for misophonia it \u2019 s taking that to more of an extreme. where it is very quickly distressing. the first reaction might be... just get me out of here \u201d though despite these extreme reactions that people experience, misophonia still isn \u2019 t recognised as a disorder. and this makes it really hard to get funding to do more research. \u201c we \u2019 re not sure what we \u2019 re talking about when we say misophonia. there \u2019 s no agreed upon definition and there \u2019 s no agreement right now about what are the key features. you don \u2019 t want to cast the criteria so wide that it would fit everyone. because then it \u2019 s not something that \u2019 s different and uncommon and impairing. \u201d for me, hearing sounds i dislike isn \u2019 t impairing. and this is an important distinction \u2013 we all get annoyed from time to time, but it \u2019 s mostly trivial. for those with misophonia it \u2019 s distressful. \u201c but if i hear a low sound that i really don \u2019 t like, low vibrational sounds really bother me, but they bother me in my chest. i feel them very strongly and it makes me feel like i can \u2019 t breathe. i feel like i have to leave wherever i am. \u201d \u201c we need to convince people this is actually a thing. so a lot more research needs to happen... \u201d so consider the feeling you get when sounds annoy you \u2013 it \u2019 s probably pleasant compared to the impulsive, strong reactions that people with misophonia feel have. recognising that this kind of sound sensitivity exists and funding more research will help us pinpoint why people have misophonia and the best ways to treat it. and... i probably should be nicer to my mum. for more on sound sensitivity disorders and specifically treating them, check out ali \u2019 s channel the psych show \u2013 it \u2019 s great. i did say that before. but still, you should subscribe. and i first heard about molly's misophonia on mike rugnetta's podcast reasonably sound \u2013 also recommend, there's a link in the description. and one more thing... hi, vanessa wanted me to tell you all that now she has hats for sale. you can buy these hats at dftba. com / braincraft and you can wear them anyway you want!",

        "video_sub_title": "well hey guys what's up just me and totoro here with a little coffee and i've got some of that i'm trying the lion's mane elixir today from the four sig maddox and it like the chocolate cert is also really nice and creamy but it's super hot out right now actually i have the a / c on like four glass to try and auto right a little bit but we're getting a torrential rainfall i don't know if you can hear that in the background so between that and the heat it's it's like it's like a rain forest and you see them it's very humid as you can tell from the title and thumbnail i've been getting many questions if i could talk about heat rash particularly this time of the year when it's hot i know many of you watched me from philippines and many tropical climates and you are you're battling heat rash you've asked me to speak about it so today i'm going to talk all about a heat rash heat rash a medical name for heat rash is actually a miliaria not milly a milly area but milly area is a very common skin disorder it's a type of brush that is due to occlusion and blockage of the sweat doc the eccrine sweat docks are not the oil gland and not our seat the sebaceous gland nothing to do with acne are our sweat doct what what puts out the perspiration when we're sweating sometimes that can become plugged up just like a plugged up poor but a little different it can become plugged up and the sweat can't get out and the result is trap sweat and an itchy bomb and depending on where in the level of the skin that the sweat is trapped the bump can have a variety of different appearances and different manifestations miliaria is incredibly common it's very common in tropical environments as i alluded to it's also very common in newborns and in hospitalized individuals particularly people who are bed bound they're back all day in bed it's also very common in athletes working out and hot humid climates some athletes like to work out in gyms where they lift weights and it's really sweaty and there's not good air circulation that's another common setting in which miliaria will arise and the cause in neat in newborns the cause is due to the fact that their little sweat ducts are immature and they haven't quite quite got all of the all of them all the mechanisms in place for perspiration it's also due to intense physical exercise can be brought about and setting up a fever when your body is trying to cool itself by producing more eccrine sweat and it's also very common and caused by occlusion of the skin with very tight fabric so in a neonate for example in a newborn not only are there little sweat ducts immature but they're often swaddled so they can become a little overheated and their sweat ducts can plug up and then with prolonged bed rest you have your the skin on the back it's not breathe it's not breathing not being exposed to air the sweat ducts get included and that can result in a heat rash with miliaria and then the other common setting in addition to hot humid climates is just working out wearing some synthetic tight fabrics like a lot of baths athleisure leggings tight clothing that doesn't allow good sweat wicking can really predispose to to development of heat rash there are actually three different types of heat rashes or miliaria and the type of heat rash that an individual it's it's a result of where in the level of the skin about the sweat duct is blocked so an in neonates for example one of the more common types of miliaria are heat rashes something called miliaria kristalina in which too little um sweat duct is blocked very superficially at the top layer of the skin and the resultant appearance of the heat rash are these tiny at one to two millimeter very very superficial fragile little water filled blisters they almost look like little sweat droplets they're very fragile and rupture easily so sometimes they go undetected and they have no associated inflammation with them they're just kind of bland appearing like i said they look like little sweat droplets miliaria crystalline on the superficial type of heat rash is most common in neonates about 9 % of the units within the first week of life will have this rationale i know many of you are expectant mothers that watch my channel and expectant dads and families so that is something that can occur in the neonate but miliaria kristalina are the more superficial type of heat rash that's that's more confident units it tends to not be symptomatic and tends to resolve with with minimal intervention and i'll get to that in a little bit then the other type of miliaria is probably the one that's most common particularly in adults is miliaria rubra rubra meaning red miliaria rubra is when there is blockage a little bit deeper still in the epidermis but a little bit deeper in the skin and it causes the sweat duct to not only be block to not be able to pump out sweat properly but also to become inflamed and the result is a slightly bigger bump a two to four millimeter bump and it's red and is very very itchy this is probably the heat where actually the majority of you verbalize in the calm that you you have you you're battling with very common about thirty percent of adults who moved to tropical climates will experience miliaria rubra and most commonly happens like on the trunk on the body in skin folds under the under the breasts and women in the abdominal folds under the armpits very common areas familiy area rubra to arise they're incredibly itchy and they you may think that it's acne or zits but you notice it goes away pretty pretty quickly within a few days of avoiding that scenario but they are very common very very itchy personally i have had flares of miliaria rubra with working out here in houston just like around the sports bra areas um i find that you know they can develop pretty readily just wear that so those sweat ducts are are being not only being occluded and not allowing the proper outflow of sweat but also there's just like a lot of irritation and aggravation from the rubbing of the fabrics and then not breathing very well so that is a very common scenario for miliaria rubra to arise more you know it's it's one of the more common presentations of miliaria rubra it also can occur you know on the back of people who were bed bound or you know on bed rest for a medical condition or you know a lot of women during their pregnancy have to to go on bed rest and maybe laying flat on their back for a long period of time and just not allowing that just not allowing the sweat outflow to to proceed normally and they can arise very very itchy and uncomfortable then a third type of malaria is one familiar area profunda and that is actually pretty uncommon it occurs exclusively in individuals living in tropical climates who have been ik experiencing bounce bouts already of miliaria rubra off and on on an ongoing basis miliaria profunda occurs when there is blockage of the sweat duct deeper down in the in the sweat duct down to the level of where the the epidermis the top layer of the skin it meets the dermis so the dermal epidermal junction that's where were the blockage occurs not only is it blocked but the sweat kind of starts to leak out into the surrounding deeper layers of the skin and creates an actual an actual skin colored bump they are asymptomatic but they have an unusual appearance to them and the biggest concern with miliaria profunda while they are asymptomatic they're not as itchy they're not itchy like miliaria rubra the biggest concern of miliaria profunda is that particularly if a large area is affected is that you essentially have wiped out your capacity to to produce to release eccrine sweat an occurrence sweat is a very important part of how we cool our bodies so individuals suffering from miliaria profunda are deeper a deeper heat rash can actually can actually overheat quite easily and are predisposed to to overheating it's a relatively straightforward clinical diagnosis for a dermatologist a clinician very common to see in the hospital i've been consulted to see patients in the hospital many times you have this it's a pretty straightforward diagnosis but there are a variety of things that look like miliaria and are not miliaria that so don't self diagnose if you are battling any type of rash on the body always seek the expert opinion of your treating healthcare provider rather than self diagnosing and treating that can really be problematic you know there are certain types of little bacterial infections that could look like this there are a variety of other skin conditions that are common that can look like this so don't self - diagnosed and self - treat always seek the opinion of your treating health care provider but if you have been given a diagnosis of heat rash of miliaria there there's really not a whole lot as far as treatment for the actual rash the major major thing is prevention prevention in the form of getting air conditioning if you don't already have it i know it can be really expensive your air conditioning goes out you're strapped that's really a bad situation removing yourself from from the environment that you're in and going to a cool place hanging out in the grocery store and the freezer section can sometimes be helpful ensuring adequate ventilation you know like i alluded to earlier it's very popular in a lot of gyms to kind of correct create the sweaty environment i think people will perceive that that they're exercising harder or working harder maybe they are i'm not an exercise physiologist but if anything they're really increasing the body's demand to produce eccrine sweat to cool the body and if that's what is it's blocked you know you you can run into the risk of overheating so making sure that your environment is a quickly ventilated opening a window a fan can really really be helpful if you are bed bound or you are taking care of someone who is bed bound and they're lying on their back it's very helpful to make sure that the individual is repositioned for a variety of reasons outside of outside of heat rash but having them lie on their side and just having a fan blow on the back can be a very helpful a very helpful measure for keeping the skin cool and dry wearing loose - fitting clothing cotton fabrics also will will help to to prevent this from happening and when you are battling a breakout of a heat rash cool compresses can be helpful on the skin and just just some damn cool compresses some people find that calamine lotion can be very helpful however it is very drying so it is recommended that you follow that up with an emollient moisturizer i happen to be a fan of vani cream light lotion in this setting i think it's very nice it's not heavy it's not occlusive but it keeps the skin hydrated and it's helpful doesn't have any fragrance or additives i listed down below with the heat rash you know you've really thrown a wrench into the normal skin physiology and the cooling mechanisms the last thing you want to do is go putting a lot of exogenous things on the skin and an effort to to relieve relieve the discomfort particularly so soap has your role here you know you have impairment of sweat coming out with the body so you you really don't need any soap at this point it's merely going to dry out the skin and and cause problems so stoked is not recommended in the setting of the heat rash you want to remove wet clothing wet clothing can be even more inclusive clothing that is saturated in sweat is occlusive and can subsequently bring about a flare of this make sure you take off wet clothing if you are drenched in in sweats after sweaty workout and hunt and just take a cool shower to rinse the sweat off of the skin again no soap and just air dry the skin no towel i know no nothing just just let the skin air dry it will dry on its own and just letting the air circulate over the skin can really be helpful in in allowing some of the physiology to get back to where it needs to be in the situation of miliaria rubra where the spots are really itchy you want to try and do your very best to avoid physically scratching them physically scratching them actually can you can introduce bacteria into this and the skin barrier is impaired there already you can introduce exotic bacterial exhaustion a slimy from your fingernails and cause a little skin infection but it's really challenging to resist the temptation to scratch achieve things a recommendation would be to just get a cool compress and lightly pat it on the skin whenever you have the compulsion to scratch because it can be quite strong and scratching merely exacerbates the impairment of the skin barrier and can predispose to just get infections your treating healthcare provider may elect prescribe a topical steroid cream for miliaria rubra as well since they are itchy and a topical steroid can help with the itch and it can help calm down inflammation in the rubra that is leading to the redness and the itch and so sometimes they can be that can be helpful depending on the location in the body and the area would guide what type of steroid so you know it's something to discuss with your treating healthcare provider miliaria our heat rash can be incredibly unbearable to cope with i hope the tips in this video we're helpful to you all as far as going over the causes contributing factors and helping you understand why why heat rash occurs and behaviors that you can avoid to prevent getting it again and you know you do the best you can you can't always control your environment unfortunately you may work in a situation where you don't have ac in your work it's summer you know so some of these tips are going to be harder but just kind of having an appreciation going in of what it is that that's causing it and doing your best to to take measures like fanning the skin i think can really be helpful so i hope you guys enjoyed this video if you liked it give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don't forget sunscreen and subscribe i'll talk to you guys tomorrow [

        "video_sub_title": "hi i want to talk about glue gun burns suppose you're doing arts and crafts and you get a little bit of glue on your hand and it hurts like crazy first thing you do is if it's a low heat glue gun burn you're running to the sink and you put it in water you put it in cold water for about 10 minutes you cool it down at that point you pull off the wax off of that and then grab either soy sauce that better take off the sting and that'll make sure does the burn it doesn't get worse or french's mustard and you can find out more on people's pharmacy will tell you why it works there is tumeric in there and it's cold and it's nice and clean another refrigerator put it on there and that will stop the singing and the fernando heal really nicely now if you have the kind of burns that i have they're second - degree burns it's probably because you did what i did decided during the glue gun up to 220 or the highest level to molten lava level and at that point you've made mistake of putting the lava on a little crap that you're gonna go on another area and you you have to hold it you have to wait you hold your little glue gun thing you have to wait until that lava cools down to a normal range where most people get burns slight burns but it's got to be almost cool for that glue to stick on something problem is is that between the 10 - 15 minutes of placing it there and holding it there's a better chance of you dropping it on your leg and and especially if you're wearing shorts you know it's gonna drop and if it drops on your lap then you're gonna have a liquid molten burn and at that point the eye yeah i happen to have a second - degree burn it peeled my skin it just kept going in at that point what do you what i did after i got done no whoo hollering and hooting screaming and having everybody watching me saying i was an idiot because i did it to myself i've turned my glow got up i were into the house got some mustard and i poured it on in my hand i mean i couldn't even put it under water earth so bad and i just poured it my hand and i sat there and it was my melting paint and i did that on my leg to leg actually was so burnt it didn't hurt well after that cools what you have to do is i peel the wax off the seared skin oh that hurts like crazy too there's something called burn gel that you can get at the local pharmacy and that's got line it came to percent but if you have there's something even better it's i think it's called boil ease and i believe it's 4 % so find something with the most amount lidocaine possible and put on that burn so you can pull off that wax let it sit there for 10 minutes both that wax at that point take some some soapy what a cool soapy water and wash that maybe some peroxide wash that won't wash it you're gonna wash that burn right and at that point what you're supposed to don't pop the blisters is you can put the antibiotic cream on it you're supposed to wrap it you do that especially if the wound is open once those blisters break i'll have to walk i'll wrap it there if if you are a weak somebody who can't handle that go to the doctor remember there's always they can treat that no wrap it no it's important to change your dressings on your burns twice it today in the morning at the night you're gonna wash it again so it's gonna be really clean because you don't want infection but neosporin on that then a fresh wound dressing and wrap it up mine is so large i had to put a wound dressing on that and we'll wrap it up with an ace bandage there so well anyway sorry about your wound there and you can effect infection go to the doctor if it starts getting infected because that can be real bad stuff thank you for watching and inhabitants",

        "video_title": "How To Fix Rounded Shoulders FAST (10 Minute Science-Based Corrective Routine)",
        "video_sub_title": "if your posture currently looks more like the photo on the left and you desperately want your posture to look more like the photo on the right and fast and you've come to the right place forward rounded shoulders like the posture i'm demonstrating here which is admittedly exactly what my pasha used to look like as a student has become increasingly common and is often developed from sustained periods of slouching and or the result of an unbalanced training routine in fact a recent 2017 paper actually found that regular weight lifters exhibited significantly greater values of forward rounded shoulders when compared to untrained individuals due to the various imbalances created by their training routines and this is a problem not only because it's just generally aesthetically unappealing but also because it can negatively affect your ability to perform certain exercises in the gym and can potentially put you at a higher risk of developing shoulder pain and injuries but before we dive into the most effective way to correct this we need to first take a look at the specific muscle imbalances responsible for creating this posture and based on the analysis of multiple papers you can confidently conclude that this posture is a combination of two things one overactive muscles that have become tight and are pulling the shoulders into this forward position with the main culprits often being the pecs and the upper traps and combination with the general lack of thoracic mobility and two under active muscles that have become weak and are failing to pull the shoulders backwards into its neutral position with the main culprits often being the mid and lower traps and the serratus anterior and what's interesting is that research actually shows that these muscles tend to become weak over time partly due to the overactive muscles that previously mentioned actually preventing us from being able to turn on these underactive muscles in the first place and therefore for the fastest results we're going to use a two - part corrective routine that first involves stretching the overactive muscles and then moves on to turning on and strengthening the underactive ones using the most effective exercises based on current scientific literature the first exercise for step one is going to be thoracic extensions which have been shown in case studies to be an effective drill to improve your thoracic mobility to open up the restricted area contributing to your rounded shoulders we want to do here is place a foam roller across your upper mid - back area with your hands placed behind your head then exhale while letting your upper back extend over the foam roller and make sure you avoid compensating during this by excessively arching your lower back you want to hold this position for a few deep breaths and then repeat this a couple more times further down your upper back and if you don't have a foam roller i'll leave a link in the description box to a couple that i personally use and would recommend for now though a decent alternative is simply performing the same movement seated or with your back on a chair again focus on extending the upper back and avoiding arching your lower back to compensate next we want to move on to band / and backs to stretch out the overactive muscles we talked about earlier that are pulling the shoulders forward what you want to do is grab a band or any kind of stick and hold it straight out in front of your chest with an overhand grip pull the band apart slightly to create some tension and then without bending your elbows you want to slowly raise the band up over your head and behind your back as far as you're capable of doing in a controlled manner and then as you get behind your back you want to focus on pulling the band apart rather than just losing all the tension in the band try your best to avoid shrugging and tensing the upper traps as you perform the movement and instead keep your shoulders pulled down and away from your ears throughout each rep and to progress this exercise what i'd suggest is starting out with a wider grip and not coming all the way back at first and then you gradually narrow your grip and go further down your back as your mobility improves as you perform the movement you should feel a deep stretch in your pecs your shoulders and your upper traps which are the exact muscles that we're trying to lengthen and if you don't have a band i'd highly suggest getting one and i'll leave a link in the description box to the one that i'm using here but in the meantime a decent alternative is simply the standing chest opener stretch where you clasp your hands behind your back squeeze your shoulder blades together and pull your arms up to deepen the stretch for these you want to hold the back position for about five deep breaths at a time now although we have done a good job with stretching out the tighten muscles it's crucial that we move on to step two of the routine - now strengthen the three key muscles that have become weak over time and are failing to pull the shoulders back and in fact key studies analyzing rounded shoulder posture have found that this step actually provides significantly greater corrective results in the stretching that we previously did and proving this point is a 2010 clinical trial on 28 individuals struggling with rounded shoulder posture the study found that activating and strengthening these three under active muscles in the subjects was key to successfully decreasing the extent of their rounded shoulder posture and thus illustrates the importance of the step and to start we'll focus on first strengthening the mid traps with the bad pull apart which has been shown in case that is to be an effective exercise that doing so to perform it what you'll want to do is hold the bat like so with your thumbs pointing up and arms directly in front of your chest then you want to pull the band apart slowly and with control while twisting your hands such that your thumbs point behind you at the end position you want to squeeze your shoulder blades together as you pull back to engage the mid traps which you should feel working during each rep and then after a few sets of the band pull apart we'll want to then slightly modify it to hit the lower traps instead by changing the line of pulley using a y raise to perform it simply set up how we previously did with the band pull apart but this time what you want to do is push your fist forward slightly to protract your shoulder blades and pull the bat apart slightly to create some tension and then from here all you want to do is slowly raise your arms up to make a y overhead and again try your best to avoid any shrugging or tensing up your upper traps as you do so when done properly as you raise your arms up you should feel a strong contraction in the lower traps shown here don't worry if you're not feeling too much in that area right now as your ability to turn on the lower traps will improve over time from both consistently practicing the movement as well as stretching out the overactive muscles from step one of the routine now again i'd highly suggest investing in a batch for these exercises but in the mean time for those without access to one you can instead perform these two movements on a bench or stability ball to hit the mid and lower traps respectively and i show how to perform these two exercises in more detail in my traps workout video which i'll link in the description box down below lastly we're going to work on strengthening the sabrina santiago all the push up plus which has been shown to be extremely effective by doing so for those with rounded posture since it not only elicits high emg activity but it also minimizes the involvement of the overactive upper traps when compared to other exercises and to perform at you simply want to get into the end of a push up position with your arms fully extended and then from here push your hands into the ground to protract your shoulder blades lifting your upper back towards the ceiling briefly hold the top position and then come back down to the starting position with your shoulder blades now retracted and then repeat for more reps you can also perform these on your knees if this is more doable for you it's a very subtle movement and you only move a couple inches upwards but you should feel the serena's muscle working and to further intensify this contraction i'd recommend the externally rotating shoulders by twisting your hands outwards before you form the movement as to emg analyses have shown that this modification leads to significantly greater serratus anterior activation than the standard grip with all these exercises it's vital that you make each rep count which means performing each rep slow and controlled with proper form and focus on engaging the right muscles that i went through so now let's put this all into a corrective routine that will only take you roughly 10 minutes to do get it's gonna work wonders for your posture but with this routine consistency and frequency really are key if you want to correct your posture as quickly as possible so if you can do so consistently then perform this routine every day otherwise i'd aim for at least 3 to 4 times per week for the best results and keep in mind guys that for long - term results you need to not only always be aware of how your posture is throughout the day and correct it accordingly but you'll also need to ensure that your training program is structured in a way that prevents these muscle imbalances from developing and that's exactly why within my built with science programs we've taken the time to carefully select each and every exercise included in your weekly training routines such that you can build lean muscle while actually improving your posture and correcting your muscle imbalances in the process to join today simply head on over to built with science com2 take the starting point quiz and discover what science -

( upbeat music ) - lamb is something that we use a lot in our dishes, not just in our spicy cumin lamb dishes. lamb is also used in other things like our lamb pao mo soup and other lamb, you know, there's like an iron pot lamb that's very popular in xi'an. there's just a lot of lamb. there's a muslim population there and that's historically because of the trade, the silk road, and different people coming through. we take a small part of that tradition. we don't cook halal food. we do have heavy influences from that type of cuisine. so, we use a lot of lamb. working well with the spices, there's like a new flavor - - - it really stands up to it. it's not chicken. if it were just on chicken then you would taste just the spice. - it was you and your dad that started the business together, right? - he started the business back in 2005. i was still in school, and then after four years, i joined the business because i just thought ( there's ) such an opportunity here. - alright, jason. we are dying to know. what is behind your lamb dishes? - i'm going to ask our central kitchen chef, mr. wang, to help us cut this apart. he's very familiar with all of our operations here, and he still personally cuts a lot of the meat himself. - jason, i notice we're keeping all these nice kind of fattier bits here. - that's a great question and a lot of our guests actually are probably going to be like, \" aw man, they use the so much gristle and crap? \" it's just because you need that fat in order to, when you're cooking on a wok, everything's going to shrink. all the fat's going to turn to oil, and you really want that lamb oil in order to give it that flavor. - do you predominately only use lamb shoulder? - any parts of lamb, honestly, that has that mixture of fat and lean meat. - [ ben ] it really does give you that kind of natural balance of a decent amount of fat, but it's also a hard working muscle. you get a lot of flavor out of it. - we're just going to marinate this a little bit. it helps to tenderize the meat. it gets some of the unpleasant gaminess out of it, but we just have to give it a better texture as well when we're cooking it. - what's going to go in our marinade? - salt, cooking wine. we have starch here and some oil. looks like we have enough lamb for our dish later. alright, we're going to bring it over to our store here that's attached to our central kitchen. we going to cook this in our wok, and then we're going to do the noodles, and you know, it's lunchtime. cool, let's do it. ( upbeat music ) we just heat the wok up really hot. - [ ben ] so, that's like already sizzling hot within like seven seconds. first thing in is the meat, give some of that fat to render down and crisp up. - the oil that we added before doesn't give it that flavor. so, really, the oil from the fat will be able to achieve that. right now, wang's adding the chili oil. that's the house made chili oil that we use. - it's not a competitive thing like in new york where people are like militant about their favorite pizza joint or anything like that is it? - it's very, very competitive. it's very competitive. like in china, your family name on the chili oil. you'll have a picture of your ancestor on the bottle. you can go to the chinese grocery stores and you'll see. if you go to the dining restaurant, you're gonna see a lot of, like a huge menu. you're like wondering, \" how do they ever cook all these items, right? \" \" do they ever cook all these items? \" they probably don't get requests for a lot of them very often, but it's important for chinese chefs to typically have a large menu. to show that they can do everything. - i never even thought about why a chinese menu would be long. much less, that it is a point of pride. it's like do you have people come in and by like, \" can i get some pork lo mein? \" - we, still get some of those. some people who ask for french fries. some people ask for chicken wings. i think thankfully because we're in a big city, and we do have a lot of exposure to different cuisines. so, people sort of understand. how do you measure up with the food that's actually in xi'an, right? that's another sort of question, and i'm very confident about it because the thing is you can't find this food in xi'an. when i say that it almost seems counterintuitive like jason are sort of admitting your food is not authentic? what is authentic? is it authentic because like, well, i'm from there. i cook food that's with that taste profile. if you mean authentic meaning you can find the same food in any of these stalls that you walk into you can find the same taste? then i guess we're not authentic. i'm not so much worried about knowledge. you know, i want people to know what is in xi'an. i want people to travel over there and then come back and be like, \" oh, okay, this is different, but you know what i can appreciate the differences. \" - it's your interpretation, and that's what makes it interesting. - it is true to like your family. it's what you ate. it's true to like the trade routes that went through there. is it more important that it's authentic? or is it more important that it's like honest, and that you're trying to do something good. - yeah, is it more important that it taste good? at the end of the day, do you enjoy it? i'm gonna pull some noodles. this is just dough. nothing special about it. so, what i'm doing is kinda pulling on it. at the same time, hitting it. just kind of slap it on the surface like that. overall, you just rip it in half. and that's the noodle. usually, i'm just gonna drop them right in the water because they can't stay too long after being pulled. do you guys wanna give it a go? he's pushing a little hard, look like he's a, - pushing a little hard, but he's - but, he's pretty fast. he's pretty fast. - look at that, look at that, wow. great motions, actually. - well enough? - looks like he's, no it looks perfect. yeah. - wow. - looks like he's been doing this for a while actually. oh, no. ( laughs ) so, we're gonna take the middle part like a string cheese, and just rip it in the middle. - look at the landing. he's stuck the landing. - this is awesome. i'm never going home. ( laughs ) - this is fun as hell. - so, it looks pretty good. we fished these out, and they are ready to go. freshly cooked lamb from before. i got the cabbage, here, and it's blanched. and we've got some scallions, and chive flowers, and celery mix. and then, we are gonna dress it with the most important things : the noodle sauce and the chili oil. ( upbeat techno ) - that is so good! i love this dish! - oh, man. - yeah, the chili oil is so nice. - we're super generous with the cumin, but it just works in this case. - the shoulder is the perfect cut for it too. it has texture. it's gonna go well with the noodles. but, because there's fat to it too, it stands up to that spice. even for this, you see the imperfections and you can tell that somebody actually made it which is awesome. that's what you want out of food. - every part of this dish is made by our own recipes. and the noodles are made to order because that's the only way it can be made. i wish i could make the noodles ahead of time. that would save a lot of trouble. it's one of the special things about us though. so, it's something i probably wouldn't change. - it's perfect for new york. you order your food. you get it in three to five minutes. it's affordable. but, like, all of this stuff is actually made here. - if you guys ever travel to like any part of asia everything's so fast, and it's just any minute that you waste it's like lost money, pretty much, right? for the guest or for your yourself or whatnot. that sort of mentality was like something even back in the days when we were in flushing. we didn't have a pr system. you had to memorize all the totals. for example, if you ordered two dishes, i had to remember it was you that ordered those two dishes. and add together the math. and i'll be like you were before him. you know, it's crazy. but, that was kind of the culture that our business was built on. - so much fun to learn about a serious new york city iconic dish. - i appreciate you guys coming, and you know, you guys were really good with the noodles. that was the most surprising part of it all. i was like you know, you guys are gonna be pretty good in the meat rooms, but i don't know about the noodles part. but, wow, you guys are good. - what time do i show up for work tomorrow? - let's get here at nine, i think? - okay, cool. this is better than the meat hook. - the commute shouldn't be that bad. ( laughs ) - if you enjoyed this video, maybe you will also enjoy some of the videos from our good friends over at vox. - [ narrator ] your oven to 350 degrees is sort of a basic requirement for baking in america. our ovens even do it automatically as we turn them on. but, have you ever stopped and asked yourself.",

        "video_sub_title": "thank you guys so much for tuning in to my channel i just want to let you know that i really appreciate all your support and all your encouragement all the messages i get from people that are being so sweet and so positive i love the positive energy and i truly appreciate it okay this the other day i was recording a video about the aikido mistakes and how people can get a keto flu and then i totally forgot about speaking about vile production i had it written but then i got carried away talking about lemon and it's actually a good thing that that happened because this is really important and i would actually rather break this down into a completely separate video because you really see a lot of information about violin viola production and it's so important for our health so before i get into it i just want to let you know anything that we learn in life that can improve anyone's quality of life we have to share it with others honestly no matter what it is you could be reading the book right now share it on your interest story tell your friends if you think it might help them you know so that's why i tell you guys please like the video please tag someone because it reaches more people you know what i mean and all i'm trying to do is just share free information that i know that are gonna help people live a healthier lifestyle which is ultimately gonna make them feel so good so that they can focus on their life and have that right energy okay so i'm gonna be talking about why it's so important so that you actually watch the full video because i know how some people like that i don't forget about this one something else you know how we can eat fixes and how we can increase it the symptoms everything so i'm really i know you see a lot of information here but i want to try this video very short i know people have a very short span with you know their attention span so they're just like sliding away and you know what i mean but just try to watch the video it's only gonna be in ten minutes and it can really improve your health okay so what is bible okay it's basically an outline fluid in our body okay that is produced within our liver and then our gallbladder stores it so that when we need it it comes out and that helps us alright so what does it actually do to our body it helps our body to digest especially fats it helps our body digest food the mainly fats and fat soluble vitamins like vitamin a vitamin d vitamin e vitamin k2 so all of these things help for a brain function our nervous system to produce and replace you know more cells that our body our skin for a hair for many things our nervous system so it's really really important that we focus on making sure that we have enough violent production so that when we are eating these fats we can actually break it down which it does breaks it down into small little particles so that our body can absorb it and take those nutrients from it so especially when you go on a high - fat diet or a ketogenic diet this is very important because your body's not really used to having this much facts so it's important that you try to increase that file so that you can break it down and not feel bloated and not feel like oh my god the food is heavy it's too much fat for my body to handle your body can't handle it but it's this could be one of the reasons why you may feel like it can't what else does it do it regulates friendly bacteria i mentioned in the past videos that when we take antibiotics medication what does it do it basically kills the good bacteria in our body and when that happens that becomes an imbalance now we have too much bad bacteria bacterias i just took antibiotics for my finger now i'm taking probiotics i'll do another video how to do it and all that stuff but it's really important that we increase that friendly bacteria and the yeast as well it destroys these unwanted organisms in our body so it really balances those bacterias out it helps get rid of waste because it helps detoxify the liver now the liver is smart danny subhana allah our body is very smart and knows what to do but because of people exaggerated with processed food and sugar it can become backed up so it's important that we you know incorporate things in our diet that will help flush those toxins out and that's one of the things that bile does it helps actually flow the cholesterol out as well so this will help lower cholesterol and prevent cholesterol stones or any type of stone gall bladder stones also type of stones so it's really important for your cholesterol so if you have high cholesterol and this is also it could be one of the reasons that it could just be vital you know what i mean um conversion of t4 to t3 hormones if you are dealing with a thyroid problem bile has a huge impact because if you're taking medication the medication sometimes won't even work your body won't even react to it because you don't have enough bible because your bile is what helps convert the the t4 to the t3 but if your hypothyroid then you don't want too much wild because then it's going to be converting too much but it's do you know so so yeah so now i want to share with you the signs that your body could telling you that maybe you don't gotta move bloating this is the one thing that a lot of people are dealing with me myself i went through a stage a couple of months i was bloating like crazy and i finally created amazing diet for myself and it worked and i can eat whatever i want now anything that i want and i don't get bloated so when you create a meal planner you go to a nutritionist or you get from a trainer it's important that they understand everything that's going on in your life not everything in your life but the most important things in your life that's happening that could be affecting you because bloating could just come from stress or not sleeping enough so it's important that they have valuate your life and your eating habits and your history and if you take it any medications or stress or whatever so that you create a plan that's gonna help you become healthy a lot of people focus on what's gonna help me lose weight but when you're your healthiest state oh you're gonna be burning fat like bang 50 so any digestive issues okay not just bloating since he's feeling tired your brain can't function these things these vitamins fat soluble vitamins are very important for your for your brain to function so if you're not absorbing that this is how it's gonna affect your body you're gonna feel fatigued you can get acne migraines constipation diarrhea actually can come from too much file because bile is a lubricant so when you have too much well and i when you have diarrhea it could actually lead to much vile acid reflux gall bladder disease non - alcoholic fatty own fatty liver gerd you can actually get right you get pain in your right shoulder even going down their arm it's crazy right you maybe want to out pain here that could be one of the reasons see how the body works to really importantly know these little things you don't matter what everything that's important to know a little bit so that you know what to eat so that you can be in your healthiest state and yellow eyes and skin you see some people they have a little bit yellow in their eyes or maybe their palms are a big yellowish is because the liver is backed up with toxins and also you're constipated all those toxins are backed up so that could you know that's really importantly to flush everything else when you go to the bathroom every day and making sure that everything is getting released and not you know getting stuff outside so now what are the things that are actually decreasing this vial that's causing us to feel this way processed foods and sugar processed food damages our gut and sugar feeds bad bacteria so then you have these unbalanced bacterias in our body this is people think weight loss weight loss you nada lose weight at home this is really important trust me you eliminate those people are thinking about cheat days all the time you know when you when you really respect your body honestly and you look at this food as something that's gonna heal you and nurture you and take care of you you don't even care about cheat meals you actually start to enjoy your diet so it's important when you when you go to these cheat meals it's not something that you praise it's the weekend i have a cheat meal oh my god you're conditioning your mind to actually not enjoy healthy eating that this healthy eating is like you're oh my god i have to do it i can't wait to have a cheat no enjoy it eat your fruit know that every food that you're eating is either healing your body preventing you from having a disease or feeding a disease okay this food is on earth for a reason um smoking and alcohol i hate to tell you what it does and saturated fat so when you go on a ketogenic diet you want to make sure that you're having polyunsaturated fats not too much saturated fats a lot of people having so high in saturated fat and that's why this diet becomes unhealthy for someone you know so when you're doing the keto it's not just about you know eating sausage and pork and you know all this cheese and everything you know what it means so it's doing it in a healthy way now how can we increase it this is the most important thing the questions you ask yourself will become the quality of your life why what how if you don't know the answer who could you ask there's information online so every time you go through a situation make sure you ask yourself the right questions because the right questions will lead you to the right solution so how can you increase it the number one thing that i have my clients do celery juice in the morning juice okay you want to put in the blender we want to take that fiber out on an empty stomach so that it can go straight to the liver and cleanse everything out you can add lemon in there because lemon is really good for you to increase that bile production and many other benefits that mentioned in the last video especially on a ketogenic diet but for anyone in general this is for anyone in general celery juice you want to leave the leaves get organic you always want to organic we don't want all these pesticides and everything you know what i mean so if you could get organic it's only a little bit more expensive i mean if i would invest into anything it would be my help before anything okay so celery juice in the morning boom you put a couple of sticks with the leaves you down it it's like medicine you might be like oh my god this is disgusting i can't do it do it for 30 days in a row and i promise you your skin your face your energy you're gonna feel incredible okay that's the easiest thing to do what i also love is artichokes god the raw auto chunks from jerusalem when the olive oil i love snacking on them i'm obsessed with it that's so much antioxidants but it's also one of the main things that helps that wild production leeks as well dandelions carrots asparagus these are all amazing and yeah the polygon saturated fat so when you're dealing with a lot of digestive issues a ketogenic diet maybe won't be the best for you because fats is hard to break down so it would i would go into law i'm gonna do a whole nother video about that stuff okay well i just want you to look at health in a different way and not just focus on fat loss and focus on packing me and your healthy estate and your body will flush all of that and more importantly you will feel amazing now if you like this video please share it like it leave a comment tag someone help someone so that they can be healthier if you have any questions shoot me a message or leave a comment below i hope you guys have a beautiful day and i will see you in the next video",

        "video_title": "Growth On Your Eye? - Pterygium Explained (SURFER'S EYE)",
        "video_sub_title": "chances are if you've noticed a growth on the surface of your eyes specifically the cornea the front clear portion of your eye it could be a pterygium or surfer's eye we're going to talk about what it is why you have it and what you can do about it let's focus in hey howdy everybody i'm dr neal guymon dr eye guy with the show that helps keep your eyes healthy and your vision clear and i do a lot of educational videos like this one as well as product reviews and how - to videos so make sure you subscribe if that's something you're interested in so you don't miss any of my future videos otherwise let's talk about that surfer's eye if you have noticed this growth that has come from the white part of the eye stretching over to the clear part or the cornea i just want you to know that this is benign or non - cancerous if it is a pterygium now a pterygium is a growth a conjunctival growth the conjunctiva is actually a clear surface layer that covers the white part of the eye this surface layer kind of acts like a skin or a barrier to the eye and sometimes it can be inflamed and become a conjunctivitis or a pink eye but it can also grow in places that it doesn't need to sometimes it can become elevated and also grow or stretch and reach over to the cornea or the clear surface of the eye the cornea is that clear window that covers the eye that allows light to pass through so you can see and it's right over the color part of the iris of the eye now one thing you don't want to confuse this with something called a pinguecula also a conjunctival growth that just stays on the white part of the eye can be elevated sometimes can be yellow i actually made a video about that you can check that right here i'll put the link up there if that's more what you're looking into this pterygium has actually specifically the growth that goes onto the cornea now the exact cause or the reason for this pterygium is unknown but it is linked to a few things number one definitely linked to more uv light or uv exposure that's why it kind of has the nickname surfer's eye people that tend to be more outdoors aren't wearing sunglasses maybe live close to the equator they get more sunlight more uv light tend to have a pterygium more than others now the area that i live i live up in idaho we commonly see a pterygium in farmers eyes they tend to be outdoors in a dusty windy environment not wearing sunglasses so they get that uv light and so they are more prone to get a pterygium another link is dryness typically if your eyes are more dry or you're exposed to dry climates then you are more prone to get this pterygium as well it kind of causes this growth to grow further the dry eye can be aggravated from blinks in your eyelid rubbing on the tissue and that aggravation can cause the conjunctiva to become inflamed and also may cause this growth a pterygium the analogy that i gave in the pinguecula video is similar to a pterygium whereas it's kind of analogy to where you can get a callus on the palm of your hands if you're working a lot it's kind of like that it's the eyes version of a callus now the downside though is usually once the growth is there it doesn't go away so usually people are stuck with this thing and they're just trying to manage it and keep it from growing bigger usually a pterygium is on the nasal side or the part of the eye that's towards the nose and you'll actually see it almost being a triangular pattern it usually kind of stretches out to a point now you can get it in one eye you can get in both eyes you can get it on both sides of the eyes if you're unlucky a pterygium can also become pretty inflamed and red and irritating again likely from these dry eyes or dry climates and it's just from that friction and irritation from the eyelid rubbing over the dry surface could cause it to be red and pretty sometimes painful to the patient now what can you do about it like i said they won't go away the game becomes managing it trying to keep it from getting bigger now first things first is you want to be wearing sunglasses to protect your eyes from that uv light just to try and keep that pterygium from growing faster or bigger next thing is you want to try and keep your eyes from getting dry you want to try and keep them lubricated as much as possible that's usually best from using artificial tears or treating your dry eye condition if you have a dry eye disease but usually if you have a pterygium or the other one the pinguecula you want to develop a habit or a routine of using artificial tears it's kind of like putting lotion on your hands you want to keep your eyes from getting to that dry state that may aggravate and may make that pterygium grow bigger now if the pterygium gets big enough to where it actually crosses over and enters the center of your vision or covers the pupil it may actually affect your vision at that point usually the recommended treatment is surgery it's just to peel that pterygium off of there to get it out of the way also if the pterygium is really elevated red it's causing constant irritation it's making your eye red just looks unpleasant that also may be grounds for surgical removal just to get that pterygium out of there so you can get rid of the irritation hopefully make your eyes look and feel better now just be sure if you happen to see or notice a growth on your eye whether it's on the sclera the white part of the eye the conjunctiva on the cornea like we've talked about make sure that you go in and see your eye doctor just so you can get an official diagnosis to know exactly what it is because you want to make sure that you know what a growth on your eye is because it could be something else and it could be bad also usually if you have a pinguecula or a pterygium you may have underlying conditions like a dry eye condition or a dry eye disease and so your doctor may be able to help you with certain treatments that may treat your dry eyes also at the same time treating or helping control that pterygium so just to review a pterygium it's a growth from the conjunctiva that may stretch over the cornea or the clear part of your eye and a tritium is benign non - cancerous how do you get it usually caused from uv exposure a lot of exposure to sunlight dry dusty windy climates and may have a genetic predisposition to it what do you do about it unfortunately that pterygium is there to stay so now becomes a management game so you want to be using sunglasses to protect your eyes from uv exposure you want to be using artificial tears to keep your eyes from getting dry and if it is to the point where it's so elevated it's causing your eyes to be miserable and irritated or it's crossed over to the center of your vision or affecting your vision then the treatment is surgery hope you like the video make sure that you remember to subscribe and also share this video for anybody that may be interested i'm dr neal guymon dr eye guy focusing on you and your eyes stay focused and i'll see you in the next video",

        "video_title": "Groin Strain Stretches & Exercises - Ask Doctor Jo",
        "video_sub_title": "hey everybody it's doctor jo, and i've got iron canine remy with me. we're going to show you some stretches and exercises for a groin strain. let's get started. the very serious tony bark, i mean iron remy had some serious serious business she had to attend to. so we'll go ahead and get started. so for groin strain, those inner muscles thigh muscles those adductors the ones that you want to stretch. so we're just going to start off on the ground. and this is kind of a modified butterfly stretch. this is before you're doing you're sitting up stretches. prop youu knees up, put your feet close together, and you're just going to drop your legs out into that butterfly position. so just really stretching out that groin area. and what this does when you're lying down like this, is uses gravity to help stretch it out. so if you're really really sore, this is probably where to start and then you can sit up if this becomes easy. but just for about 30 seconds, just let gravity stretch it out. if that doesn't feel like much of a stretch, take your hands towards your knees and then just push down a little bit to get that extra stretch. so you can do you about 30 second holds and three of those to get it all stretched out. then you also want to stretch your hamstrings out because with the hamstrings they're all kind of close together and those are tight they can affect the groin area as well when you have a strain is really close to that area. so you can stretch the hamstrings out whole bunch of different ways, but i'll just show you an active assistive way. so just bring your knee up, kind of grab behind your leg just let it relax, and then you're going to straighten up your leg into a stretch. so you might only be able to get to here if everything's tight, if it if you can get all the way straight with your knee, that's great, and if you want to use your toes to get more of a stretch, if you pull them towards you that will stretch it out even more. so again holding that for about 30 seconds, and then do three of those. after you get everything stretched out, then you're going to strengthen those muscles. so start off with a simple straight leg raise. keep your leg nice and straight, pull up your toes kind of help lock out the leg, and then just slowly lift up that leg to about the other side bent knee, and then slowly come back down. so make sure you're going nice and controlled with this that you're not going fast you're not kicking your leg up super high, but you're doing a controlled motion to work those muscles. start off with about 10 of them, you can work your way up to 20 25, if that becomes easy then you can add ankle weight onto there. now you're going to flip over onto your side with the leg that you want to work on the ground. so now you're going to do an adductor strengthening exercise which is bringing that bottom leg up. some people like to put the other leg in the back. some people like to put it in the front. i think it's a little more comfortable for me to put mine in the back. but you're gonna still keep that leg as straight as you can, so pull your toes up towards you and then just lift it a little bit off the ground it doesn't have to be a big lift because you're just not going to be able to go super high, but same thing you want to be nice and controlled going up and then slowly coming back down as well. so just start off again with about 10 of these, if you have a growing strain this is might be a little uncomfortable the first time you do it so you might even want to break it down to like two sets of five instead of 10 all the way through. but as that becomes easier you can add weights after you get the 20 / 25 and there's no problems with that. so the next one is going to be a side plank with some movement. so with the side planks you can do them one of two ways, if you want to modify it a little bit, you can go on your knees. go up into a side plank like this, make sure your elbows pretty much underneath your shoulders straight underneath, and you're going to drop it down and come up. so you're just working those muscles. now if this is pretty easy for you, you want to be in a nice straight line putting everything straight out so it's not forward like this, but that's easy, then you can go into a straight plank and then drop down and come up. so really try drop down as low as you can without touching the ground or falling over, and then coming up into a straight line. so just kind of dropping down and coming up. for the last stretch, to really stretch those adductors the growing area, you want to put your leg out up on your knees the leg you want to stretch is here and put it straight out. now this just might be enough stretch for you as it is. kind of like a half split, but if you need more you're going to lean this way, kind of sit your butt down and out and you're really going to feel that stretching through there. so holding that for 30 seconds if you feel off balance, put your hands down so you can lean into it a little bit more and then come back up, and do three of those. so nice big stretch. so there you have it. those are your stretches and exercises for a groin strain. if you have any questions, leave them in the comment section. if you'd like check out some other videos, go to askdoctorjo. com and remember be safe, ( iron canine's out there to help you out ), have fun, and i hope you feel better soon.",

        "video_title": "Satellite dish solar cooker - cooking a hamburger.",
        "video_sub_title": "hi everybody and thanks for stopping by for another episode of bernardo's tech blog. a few months ago i made a video showing how to convert a satellite dish into a parabolic solar cooker and in that video i promised that i'd make another video to demonstrate the use of this and so that's what i'm gonna do today. now, the first thing i want to show you is this little contraption i made here that allows me to hang a cooking vessel in the focal point of the parabolic solar oven. that's something i hadn't finished up at the time i made the other video so i'm going to go into detail of what i did there. the first thing i did was find a stick that fits perfectly in this little aluminum channel here that was part of the dish and then i drilled a bunch of holes in it that allowed me to adjust it up and down as much as i want. there happen to be a hole already drilled in this aluminum channel here so i was able to put a.. just drop a nail in that hole and put it through one the holes in the stick to adjust it up or down. now on the top you can see here i have a hook that i put on the end and i have a chain that goes down to the cooking vessel. now this is just an ordinary one - quart pan that i got at wal - mart. i selected it for a couple of reasons : first, because it's a one - quart pan that means it is pretty small i knew going into this project that this is a pretty small dish for a parabolic solar cooker so i know that i won't be able to do a lot of food at one time and so for that reason i want a small pan. the other thing is i don't wanna block a lot of the sun because, since i have a small dish obviously i don't wanna... i want as much surface area reflecting back to the pan as possible. so for this kind of dish a one - quart pan seems like the obvious choice. the other thing is, i wanted something that was pretty lightweight this pan is pretty lightweight and that makes so it can heat up rather quickly. the other thing that led me to buy this one is that it is stainless steel. i've never been a fan of that teflon coating. it seems like after you use it for a while it starts to flake and you wonder what exactly is ending up in your food. so i got a stainless steel one. there was only one problem with it - actually two problems : one problem was it was silver and so i used some flat black paint to paint it the same type of paint you would use to paint a charcoal grill and i just sanded it lightly before i painted it in hopes that it would help the paint stick a little better and the reason i painted it of course is that black absorbs heat and so i'm hopeful that that will help the efficiency of the oven a little bit. the other problem this little pan had is that it had no handle that i could use to hang it from the chain i have here so i was able to improvise with a coat hanger to allow me to hang this on the chain. i also made the chain long enough that i can adjust it up and down just by changing it to another link and i have plenty left over there so i can adjust it as far up or down as i need to get it exactly in the focal point alright, i think i'm going to go ahead and give this a try. i have it oriented so it's in the focal point as you notice, i'm not even using the chain here on the fourth of july with the sun almost directly overhead it turns out that i cannot use the chain to get it over the focal point so i'm gonna have to do it this way and see if i can make it work. i have a hamburger here that i'm gonna try to cook for you today so let's see what happens. a little cooking spray to make sure it doesn't.. nothing sticks and i'm gonna go ahead and put this in. it sounds like something is happening. go ahead and cover it up and see what happens. alright, it's been about twenty minutes and there's been a few passing clouds but i think this is pretty much done. alright, i think i've learned a few things today first of all i think i'm satisfied with the performance of the oven and i realize that i was only cooking something for one person but i think, based on the size of the dish this is probably what i can expect. what i didn't like is the way i had arranged to mount the pan. i don't think that's going to work too well. i don't like the pan being at an angle like that so i'm going to rig up some sort of a tripod and just hang the pan from that and hopefully have a full range of movement so i can put it exactly where i want it and have it level as well. hopefully i'll be able to do a video of whatever solution i come up with. thanks for watching today's video, and i'll see you next time!",

        "video_title": "FIX Forward Head Posture! (Daily Corrective Routine)",
        "video_sub_title": "what's going on guys is jeremy here back with another video and today we're going to be talking about forward head posture which is something that is honestly becoming a lot more prominent nowadays due to increased technology use and time spent sedentary and we usually see this posture associated with rounding of the shoulders and rounding of the upper back and this isn't always a case but regardless we need to address the issue of what's happening at the neck because it's thinking forward of the head causes a considerable increase in the amount of pressure that is placed on your spine and over time this can lead to neck pain breathing problems and a lot more serious health issues and you're also just going to look healthier taller and just overall more confident when you get this posture corrected ideally if you were to draw a straight line down from the top of your head down to your hips everything should be aligned like so instead of your head protruding forward and the reason your head does this is one due to weakened muscles mainly the deep cervical flexors that are supposed to keep your head in this neutral position and too overactive and tight muscles that are causing your head to protrude forward so what you need to do to fix this is stretch the muscles that are tight and strengthen the muscles that are weak which has actually been shown in clinical studies like this one by butler at elle to be a very effective method in correcting forward head posture if properly implemented in this video i'm going to show you guys a daily routine that you can use consisting of stretches for the tight muscles strengthening exercises for the weak muscles and tips to prevent your forward head posture from coming back or worsening the three main muscles we need to focus on stretching and releasing are the sternocleidomastoid the anterior scalenes and the suboccipital as a result of hours of looking down at our phones or computer every day these muscles become stuck in a shortened position which creates the forward head posture that you see the first stretch is going to lengthen the sternocleidomastoid you can do this either sitting or standing but make sure that you keep your back straight and neck in line with your spine as you perform the stretch to stretch the left side using your left hand to press your chest a little bit to create some traction rotate your head to the opposite side and then bring your head all the way back until you feel a stretch you should feel a nice pull in the front of neck hold this for 30 to 60 seconds or 10 deep breaths and then switch to the other side the second stretch is very similar but is going to target the anterior scalenes to stretch the left side use your left hand to depress your chest bring your right ear to the right shoulder then rotate your head to the left and then point your chin up towards the ceiling again you should feel a nice stretch in the front of your neck hold this for 30 to 60 seconds or 10 deep breaths and then switch to the other side the third muscle we're going to target are these sub occipital which are located in the back of the neck we are going to release them by using a tennis ball or lacrosse ball and placing the ball on one side of the back of the neck while lying on the ground and tucking the chin up and down you can hold the ball with your other hand to prevent it from slipping do this for about 10 deep breaths on each side now we are going to work on strengthening weakened muscles in our neck which is just as important as stretching the tighten muscles as we previously did for this we are going to use chin tucks which active both strengthen the weakened muscles and lengthen the tight ones to start do these while lying on your back with your knees bent like so tuck your chin by activating the muscles below your chin in the front of your neck and hold this for a second or two and repeat think about trying to give yourself a double chin and you can also use two fingers to guide and cue your chin through the movement perform about 15 reps of these once these get easy for you you can progress it by just very slightly lifting your head off the floor by a centimeter and then performing the chin tucks with your head elevated again focus on activating the muscles in the front of your neck which you should feel working throughout the movement and these don't necessarily have to be performed just on the ground they can be done sitting or standing with your back straight against a wall or even when you're driving or just standing throughout the day try to get around 30 to 40 reps of these throughout the day now finally in addition to these exercises you need to be aware of your neck alignment throughout the day and during lifts you perform in the gym when sitting or working on the computer always try to keep your head and neck in a neutral position with your back and when it comes to exercises in the gym something i see a lot is sticking the head forward during every rep especially during pressing and pulling movements this is only going to worsen your head position over time so be aware of this and instead keep your head aligned with your back during all of your lifts instead of protruding it forward so to sum the video up here is a sample routine that you can use ideally two to three times every day when it comes to postural corrections frequency is the most important factor so try to do these at least a couple times a day and you'll start to see improvements in your posture very quickly that's pretty much it for the video guys i hope you enjoyed it and found it useful if you did like the video of them please don't forget to give the video a like share it around with some friends who you think would benefit from this and also don't forget to subscribe to my channel for more content and don't forget to turn notifications on for my channel as well i would really appreciate all that and one thing to keep in mind guys is that this posture took literally hundreds of hours to develop so it's not something that's just going to fix itself overnight but if you adhere to as they consistent with the routine that i mentioned in this video then you're going to see a lot of major improvements really quickly however that being said forward head posture more often than not is a company with upper cross syndrome or rounding of the shoulders and the upper back so if you guys are struggling with that as well and i highly suggest that you check out this video that i made on that topic as i think you guys will find really useful anyways that's it for this video guys i will see you next time [ music ]",

        "video_title": "How to find a Vein in the Hand for Starting IVs & Drawing Blood",
        "video_sub_title": "hey everyone it's sarah with registered nurse orion comm and in this video we're going to go over how to find veins in the hand the hands are a popular place to draw blood or start an iv and i'm going to give you some tips and tricks that i've learned over the years of being a nurse of how to get those veins to pop up and how to get the best iv access so let's get started okay in the healthcare profession we like to use the hand veins they're easy to go to they're usually really superficial not deep like your ac veins or your for harm vein and and they're typically easier to hit by some things you want to watch out for if this patient you're getting is going to be good in getting like vesicant drugs meaning these are drugs hard on the hand like vinegar in some antibiotics amiodarone you would never never use a hand bang because these veins are fragile you would want to use a large vein or the patient would need a central line so make sure you see what all the word for your patient also is your patient there for a possible pulmonary embolism so they're probably going to be going for a ct with p protocol and you would have to get an 18 - gauge and their ac so you wouldn't even need to bother using the hand and you need to ask yourself is your patient going to be you getting a lot of drugs a lot of drips probably won't use a hand veins let's use bigger vein but i'm also ask the patient a lot of patients don't like veins and ivs in their hand because it hurts and it is a sensitive area so just warn the patient because there's a lot of nerves there so what i like to do is i like to begin by putting the tourniquet on some people put the tourniquet above the elbow but whenever i'm doing the hand i put the tourniquet about right here in this area so let's do that and if you don't know how to properly put on a tourniquet i have a video on how to put a tourniquet on properly because there's a way you want to do it okay it's on and what you're going to do is you're going to have the patient pump their hand because that's going to cause all this blood to pull into these veins and engorge them and make them really large because you're going to decrease your chances of missing this vein if this vein is popping up at you that's a lot of issues new beginners have they don't get that vain nicely and engorge okay so you can quit pumping your hand and just look at how beautiful these veins are they've just really popped up there now if you have a patient who's dehydrated you definitely want to get this done with the tourniquet on fairly tight having them pump if you have someone who has really cold hands who have bad circulation try to get a warm blanket and put that over their hands to make those veins come more to the surface because you in order to get the veins of the hand you have to have them close to the skin now let's zoom in and look at these veins okay these veins are nice and engorge another technique if you're having problems getting these veins and gorge have the patient dangle their arm down by their side so all this blood just pulls down there and another thing you can do to get these veins to really slap out or pop out at you is you can sort of slapping like this i don't know if you've ever seen someone doing that but it just causes them to really just bounce up and just become a little bit more visible and this one popped up a little bit more and it just allows you to be able to see it a little bit better okay now what we want to do i'm going to show you the importance on picking a right good vein in the hand what you're going to look for whenever you are especially starting an iv you want something that is straight you don't want something that's curved or really small like this because look this is a 22 - gauge iv doesn't have a needle this is the cannula and this part is what is going to go in the vein of the patient so you want a nice vein that's straight because if not you're going to risk the chances of going through the vein you're going to blow the vein or something like that so what we'd want to pick for this is this vein is really nice looking right here and you would not want to use this vein right here that is way too small that's a great vein for drawing blood but not a good vein for sticking a cannula in see it's not long enough so you want to use this one or that one right there now one thing that you have to watch out for see where these two veins have branched out into one is bifurcated right there there's a valve in there somewhere and a lot of times whenever you're poking the ivy with a needle you'll hit it and you're not going to get blood returned it's like oh no am i not in the vein but what's happened is that you've hit this valve and you're just not getting a blood return so if you try to thread it in and flush it you're probably going to see that it's in there but just be aware of that you probably hit a valve and that's where those valves are is whenever these little veins like to bifurcate now after you do that after you decide what type of vein you want you want to make sure that you don't have a rolling vein everyone's heard of the dreaded rolling mates and your hands like to roll because they're super superficial but after years of technique i have learned how to prevent that okay what you want to do is you just want to look and see how these veins roll move the skin around look touch on it see how whenever i touch it just with my finger it like moves to the side yeah that's called rolling now if i had if i went in with a needle right now with his hand relaxed like this it's just going to go to the side and i want to miss it and i'm going to get frustrated so what you need to do to prevent that have the patient make a fist okay and tell them not a tight fist but a light fist just like that because if they make too tired of a rif this it's going to make these veins flat and you don't want that so a light wrist this and you're going to poke the needle in and it's just and you can hold right here above it and just keep your veins stabilized so you notice how whenever i'm touching with my finger that magna just stayin in place and it's not rolling like how it was earlier that is just an awesome way to prevent that from happening so anytime you're doing this hold it have the patient make a fist and go straight in and you're going to get it every time so that is how you find a vein in the hand hands are easy typically people have great veins in the hand just try to use these techniques that i showed you and you should increase your success rate in getting an iv or drawing blood out of hand bangs okay that is how you find veins in the hand i hope this helps you out be sure to check out my other videos on how to start an iv the difference between different iv gauge needles and things like that and thank you so much for watching and be sure to subscribe to my you tube channel",

        "video_title": "How To Fix Lower Back Posture",
        "video_sub_title": "hey everyone jared beckstrand here physical therapist and owner founder of tonenton. com today we're talking all about lower back posture and specifically anterior pelvic tilt posture we'll discuss what that is why you get it why that matters kind of how it relates to maybe some low back pain that you might be experiencing and give you some simple exercises that you can do to take care of this problem [ music ] today now in construction if you wanted to build a very stable structure you're going to spend a lot of time on the foundation you want to make sure that foundation is strong it's firm and then it's also very flat and level our bodies the same way our pelvis is the foundation upon which our spine sits and so it's kind of built right on top of that pelvis if we want it to be firm we want to be level we want it to be stable now what is an anterior pelvic tilt posture that's where our pelvis actually tips forward and what causes this big arch in our lower back and i hope you guys can kind of see that right here it looks just like this i tell people in my physical therapy clinic think of your pelvis like it's a bucket full of water we want that bucket to stay nice and level to keep all the water in it anterior pelvic tilt is if i were to take that bucket and tip it forward that water would be spilling out the front just like okay if my pelvis was that bucket of water right now that water is going to be spilling out the front because my hips are rotated forward like this and so that's what we call that anterior pelvic tilt posture and so why do we get it most of the time it's because of tight hip flexors and so a lot of us spend a lot of our day sitting whether it be at the office whether it be driving whether it be just you know coming home relaxing being sedentary in general we spend a lot of our day sitting and what that does is that creates an adaptive shortening of our hip flexors you've got a muscle that originates right here on your lower back and it wraps around the front of your femur and it connects right into the front of that femur so you can see when i'm in this position the distance between my back and my femur my thigh bone right here is going to be shorter and so that muscle over time if we spend a lot of time in this position shortens up now what happens when we stand up when we lengthen our leg out like this all of a sudden now that muscle is tight and so it's anchored down here it's pulling on our lower back and rocks us forward into this anterior pelvic tilt posture and so we get an adaptive shortening of the hip flexors the other thing that usually happens with this because that's so tight it pulls our other muscles and it kind of creates some space on the on the opposite side so we get tightness from our lower back to our front of our hip and then we typically get looseness or in this case weakness on the other on the other side so our abs especially our lower abs and our butt tends to get weak and it creates what we would refer to as a lower cross syndrome so tightness from the back to the front of the hip right here weakness from the lower abs and the butt right here and so those are the two things that we want to correct now a lot of times people will say oh my back hurts i think it's because my hamstrings are so tight when they come into my clinic and when they look like this when they stand and they're you know have this anterior pelvic tilt posture it's not your hamstrings that are tight that's causing the pain in your lower back it's the pain in your lower back and it's this anterior pelvic tilt posture that's causing the tightness in your hamstrings so for example hamstrings anchor right down here they go down and they anchor well below the knee they come down the back of the leg right into this spot right here if i were to tuck my pelvis backwards underneath myself kind of create a posterior pelvic tilt that upper anchor point is right here what happens if i roll forward now you'll see that that higher anchor point right here actually lifted up and so that's what causes that stress in those hamstrings and so you don't need to stretch your hamstrings out with this if you have this anterior pelvic tilt posture kind of this sway back posture stop spending time stretching your hamstrings that's not what you need to do we need to instead stretch out the hip flexors and then we need to strengthen especially the lower abs and the glutes so let's show you some of my favorite exercises for that right now the hip flexor stretch that i teach the most often to my patients is going to be a tall kneeling hip flexor stretch so again hip flexors are tight in this position in order to lengthen them out and put them at their maximum length we need to get out of this position and kind of back into this position is going to really stretch those hip flexors out in order to do that what you're going to do is drop down onto one knee and so i'm tall kneeling right now i'm down on my right with my left in front of me i'm going to take kind of a big lunge step forward with my left and then just lunge onto that foot and right there i can feel that big pull right here through that hip flexor you can even enhance this more by lifting the arm up and over your head and really trying to arch kind of back this way right here now the important part of this is that i don't want it to pull well you're going to feel it a little bit on your lower back but try not to let it round your lower back meaning i want you to keep your your spine relatively straight with this basically don't let it don't let that pelvis tilt posteriorly or excuse me anteriorly try to keep it more or less in a neutral position as you come up into this stretch you're going to feel again that pull right through the front of that hip flexor spend about 20 seconds there do that three times so about a minute of stretching on the right and then about a minute of stretching on the left and again that's the hip flexor stretch that i like now we need to strengthen our glutes we need to strengthen our lower abs we'll show you some exercises for that all right so in addition to the hip flexor stretch we need to spend some time strengthening the glutes and the lower abs lower ab work we need to do in the right position i'll show you how to get there and so the first thing we need to do so some glute strengthening exercises that you can do at home i like the bridge is probably the easiest and my favorite in this position you're going to squeeze your butt together so contract your glutes and then use your glutes to lift your hips up off of the floor and then come right back down here on this i shoot for about sets of 20 about three sets of 20. if this is too easy if you feel like you can do this all day and it's not really that difficult i like to kick it up to even a single leg bridge now i'm going to extend my left leg out in front and now i'm just using that right glute so my focus is on that right glute to contract that to lift those hips up off of the floor now with this again i want to keep that foundation that pelvis very stable what i don't want is this hip to fall down to the ground like this you're really going to have to contract that glute to hold that hip up towards the sky and then that's what it becomes so on those single leg bridges about three sets of ten is what we're after on both sides and so right and left on that one that's my that's my go - to glute exercise at home now for the lower abs here's the thing you need to do it in the right position and so right now and hopefully you guys can see this i've got kind of this big anterior pelvic tilt going on my back is way up off of that mat that's not the position that i want to strengthen in so your first step here is to actually roll your hips tuck your hips underneath yourself flatten your back down into the floor mat whatever it is that you're on that's the first step so we don't want to strengthen in this anterior pelvic tilt position we want to put that pelvis into neutral flatten it down into the into the floor and then that becomes your starting position from here i want to keep that back flat keep your tummy tight so i tell people suck your belly button into your spine that's going to activate that deepest abdominal stabilizer muscle it's going to help to keep your back in that flat position flatten your back suck in your tummy and then hold that position while we take you through a series of marches so we can actually march march march march looks just like that would be phase one about 20 marches is what we're after again the most important part is keeping that back flat now if marching is too easy we can go into the into into a leg extension so it looks like this out and again the most important part is that you're gonna keep that spine nice and flat that would be phase two phase three and the most difficult and again maybe phase one or two is where you're at right now that's great phase three is going to be actually both legs out and again the struggle here is that the weight of my legs are going to want to rock me into an anterior pelvic tilt i want you to keep your back flat while you extend your legs out that's what that posterior pelvic tilt looks like you keep your spine nice and flat and then we're just going to get into some flutter kicks flutter kicks are a great way that we're working those lower abs again as long as i keep that back in that stable that back flat position it's a great exercise for it we are working a lot of hip flexors with this but your stomach should be working just as hard to keep your back flat and your posture where we need it to be and so about 20 or so flutter kicks is what we're going for with that back nice and flat stomach is nice and sucked in stabilizing the spine in that position so those are a couple exercises that i like i've got one more for you all right and i've got one more for you this is kind of a combination of a hip flexor stretch and a glute strengthener on this one we're going to get into a lunge position and so a normal lunge you come right down here you bend your knee and you come back up unlocking this leg unlocks that hip flexor as well so we don't want that to happen try to keep that knee straight as you come into this lunge so i'm getting a good hip flexor stretch right here and then as i pull up out of this lunge we can use a lot of quad to do that however i want you to focus on your butt i want you to focus on using your glute to pull out of that position so from right here hip flexor stretch right here i'm focusing on my glute to get that hip extension to come up out of that lunge position this can further be enhanced if you grab a couple of dumbbells so again down into this lunge keep this leg straight down into that lunge hip flexor stretch and then i'm really going to focus on pulling up out of it with the glue just like that so it kind of makes it a little bit more of a dynamic type stretch and a dynamic strengthening exercise a great exercise to kind of work both of those areas at the same time make sure you try that one out as well okay and so we talked about anterior pelvic tilt what it is and why you get it so it's that the shortening of the hip flexors the lengthening and the weakening of the butt and of the lower abs those are the things that you need to train you need to stretch where it's tight you need to strengthen where it's weak hopefully this what that does is you see that kind of pull you out of that posture and kind of into this more natural neutral position hopefully that alleviates some of the back pain that you might be experiencing because of this poor posture now that's it i hope you guys found this useful um i enjoy shooting it for you this is stuff i talk about all the time and stuff that i'm passionate about so thanks for watching if you

        "video_sub_title": "hello i am victoria toeva national trainer we are to farrella in this video lesson we will continue the topic of working with black eyeliners using the example of even more interesting products we will consider a few more techniques we have already prepared the face tone of the model using the line and wait for the lilac base foundation concealer and cream blush mine eyebrow models are great where you need to, i will tint them a little, but initially we comb them to form the eyebrows using a pencil and the help of shadows or a waterproof oao kvadra cream - corrector, paint over the tail if necessary by lengthening it and then add it as necessary in the lumen zone since the accent is in the makeup will be placed on the arrows on the eyeliner, then with the shadows i will use a minimal gray - beige shade of the shadows of the satin texture will create a slight haze and literally lightly stroke to create an essentially so - called false fold, therefore i chose a shade that is rather soft, not too intense so that the effect is gentle m light haze from below echoes the silhouette of the eyebrow soft haze of the so - called shape of a false fold creates the effect of tightening the eyelid remember the boundaries here should not be compared as a basic technique i use a pencil artist liner automatically ultra black and matte soft liner technique dots technique we start from the center we go to fly out and then blend it all with a brush in more detail this technique was covered in the previous lesson techniques of liner insanely convenient it does not require anything extra just too but you can use it as a base this is a classic when working with liquid eyeliner it serves as a template for you for example with an aqua liner it will be very convenient, but i will show you the techniques using two new types of liquid eyeliner, this is a marker format marker pen that allows you to make ultra graphic arrows and a completely new tool liquid eyeliner mascara with which you can get ultra matte ultra black spectacular arrows all liquid textures are necessary o shake up the eyeliner mascara young liner real mascara like in calligraphy and a special brush that allows you to make different effects completely covering an absolutely black marker eyeliner applicator in the shape of a felt - tip pen allows you to get very thin exquisite lines to draw, for example, the effect of double arrows or cilia, while the coating will be vinyl by lightly pressing the applicator you can add the required amount of textures and in order to get a very black effect on the pencil as in the template we begin to draw the eyelids from the middle moving to the departure you can slide you can make the printing movements create the line that you like to expand or make it tong it is also relevant for girls who like to extend eyelashes, textures last for a very long time, again, the tail of such an arrow can be made neat within the framework of the classical technique, but in terms of texture it will be a charcoal black matte effect of black mascara for calligraphy, now i will show a few more there are few tracks that can be added to such techniques using an automatic pencil or a waterproof version of ok weiss you can enhance the false crease effect liner skating technique allows you to raise the overhanging part of the eyelid ideal situation when the dan somehow merges with the arrow with your eyes open the vingt liner technique is quite artistic quite artistic and, most importantly, extravagantly i hope you have decided on a technique that suits you and whether you want to try which one you want to try choose liners train it is the experience that will help you as a result",

pack maybe more i think it's four and a couple in the five packs and we have so many of these you guys and i'm always trying to come up with ideas on how to use them because they are quite cute and we use a lot of them with our dolls you know to place shopping with and what have you but yeah like i said i'm always trying to come up with ideas to use these because my girls like to save these but we just have so many it's just becoming overwhelming well one of our new friends christy hi christy if you're watching today sent me a message on instagram and if you're not following me on instagram i'm mommy crossed a lot on instagram i would love to have you follow me because i do follow everyone back anyways christy sent us an idea to use these little shopping bags for lipgloss and if you recall we did a video i think around christmas on the do - it - yourself lipgloss we used the hot cocoa mix and the cake mix she said that she pours lip gloss in these and lets it set and then you have a nice little container for your lip gloss so thank you so much christy for that idea i'm definitely going to use that today however i'm going to also put my own little spin on it because if you are a shopkins collector you know you get a lot of duplicates we have so many duplicates of lippy lips let's see i think we have four we have four yes she is lippy lips and rainbow bite i believe i think i have a rainbow bite somewhere i think i too in here anyways these are the ones that we get the most duplicates of lippy lips and rainbow bite yeah right here lippy lips is a cute little lipstick as you can see she's adorable kim kennedy likes to pretend like she's putting on lipstick with lippy lips anyway so we have four of these right here or lippy lips and of course we don't want to get rid of any of our shopkins so i thought we would make the lip gloss and put the lip gloss in the little shopping bag and we would also include lippy lips so we're gonna put lippy lips down in the shopping basket not basket in the bag and we're gonna pour our lip gloss right on top and then we're gonna give this to a friend maybe for like a little gift maybe valentine's day is coming up and once they get done using the lip gloss they'll have a shopkins how adorable all right so we're gonna make the lip gloss just like we did in the previous tutorial except i'm going to be using kool - aid drink mix today so we're going to use some of our bags just like this one and we're going to use the lippy lips and if you don't have lippy lips you can use another shopkins any shopkin will fit in here you're probably going to get a small and though let's see we have this one right here would work yeah and you could stick it in there pour the lip gloss right on top and then once you use it all all right so that's what we're gonna do it's really simple guys i'm using a jar of vaseline i'm using a red kool - aid drink mix cherry flavor i'm gonna need a shopkins shopping bag and a shopkins of your choice i'm using lippy lips now if you want to make your lip gloss tinted you can also use an older lip gloss or lipstick that has a little color to it i'm using this old wet and wild lip color that no one seems to use around here so we're just going to take a little bit off of the top and add it with the vaseline before we mix it up in the microwave you okay we are now finished with our lippy lips lip gloss look at that little cute shopkin in there so adorable and as you can see the lip gloss is not going anywhere neither is lippy lips i tinted my lip gloss mixture pink because lippy lips is pink of course you don't have to tin it any color if you don't want to i'm also using a purple shopkins bag from season two but you see there's also blue bags that you can work with now um you see lippy lips right here at the corner of my bag she's she's in there believe me half of her body is in the lip gloss on how i got her to the corner because usually when you put her down below in the basket and you pour your mixture over she will go to the bottom now if you want her peeking out the top of course i wanted her peeking out the top so people could tell that she was a shopkins and this was lip gloss all i did was i took a clothespin and i just come over here and grab the lippy lips with the clothespin and i also grabbed the little handle back here and put them together and just held them with this clothespin until my mixture solidified and it does not take long for the mixture to harden you can even put it in the refrigerator if you want to but literally takes like 10 minutes 10 to 12 minutes all right but as you can see the lip gloss and lip elipses inside there's my pink lip gloss this is adorable and i love it it smells like kool -

        "video_title": "How To Balance Hormones with Supplements",
        "video_sub_title": "you may be hearing the term hormone imbalance \u2013 but what does this actually mean? hormones are compounds that our body makes that regulate so many different functions within our body and they can be impacted by stress, the amount of exercise you're getting, what you're eating, and your environment. some common symptoms of hormone imbalance can be things like anxiety, fatigue, hair loss or even hair growth, weight gain, and pms. when we talk about hormone balance there's four key hormones that you should know about. the first key hormone we're going to talk about is cortisol. it's the main hormone released in response to stress. when it's high our bodies can experience fatigue and weight gain. insulin is a hormone that's released from the pancreas in response to the foods that we're eating. when insulin is high this can encourage your body to store fat. thyroid is a hormone that impacts our energy and metabolism. if you're feeling tired or sluggish or you're noticing your body holding on to weight in different ways it could be because your thyroid is being impacted. the last one we're going to talk about is estrogen. estrogen is a hormone that regulates our menstrual cycle. at age 35 sometimes estrogen levels can decrease and this can lead to mood swings, night sweats, and an irregular period. so the good news is there are a lot of things we can do to regulate hormones. we can manage our diet, we can move our bodies, manage stress and there's also some supplements that can help regulate and balance hormones in our body. the first thing you can take is fish oil. fish oil contains omega - 3s which are building blocks or precursors to making hormones. a 2012 study found that more omega - 3s in the diet actually help decrease insulin resistance. next up we have vitamin d which can play a critical role in the production of hormones like estrogen. it can also help with insulin resistance and balancing blood sugar. next up zinc which is an important mineral for thyroid function health. some women that are taking birth control can have lower levels of zinc so make sure you're getting enough either through supplementation or your diet. check with your doctor, however, because it can be easy to hit the upper level of zinc. besides these crucial vitamins and minerals, herbs can also help balance hormones. vitex or chaste berry can help increase the amount of progesterone we have circulating in our body. this can help ease menstrual cramps and pms symptoms. and finally we have rhodiola rosea which is an adaptogen. adaptogens are roots of certain plants that can help our bodies more effectively respond to stress which helps decrease cortisol levels. besides just taking supplements there are some powerful lifestyle techniques that you can incorporate. getting sunshine, sleeping adequate amounts, having a balanced diet, and movement are all key lifestyle factors that can help balance your hormones. there you have it! hormone balance in a nutshell. if you have any additional questions comment below. if you like this video, give it the old thumbs up and i will see you guys in our next video.",

        "video_sub_title": "a first of its kind genetic blood tests can determine whether or not there is a blockage in your heart. kpbs science and technology reporter peggy joins us with how this simple test could spare patients from invasive medical procedures. so what is a traditional way doctors figure out if there is a blockage in the heart. one of the most traditional is angiogram they flood it into your heart from your thigh and they inject dye and look for a blockage. it is invasive. and comes from some risk some people die from it. it is not a procedure to take lightly. what impact might these new blood tests have on the number of angiograms performed each year? that is the goal, 2 million americans in the u. s. who get one each year several studies have shown over 60 % of those people don't have significant blockage meaning probably wasn't necessary to do it. more importantly, about 700, 000 people who under go this test have no blockage. 700, 000 people get this risky test that or could be risky that basically don't have any blockage and don't need it this blood test could change that. a feeling of security but meanwhile they have gone through the angiogram. so let's talk about the blood test. that is the interesting thing. how will that help doctors decide whether a patient has an artery blockage? it is just blood. well, a genetic they like to call it genomic blood test they look, they take a regular blood test and look at white blood cells in those tests and look at the genes and evidently, the genes in those white blood cells will react differently. you are talking about a blood test where you look at somethings versus an angiogram i don't know the answer to this but i am curious if there is a differential in the way they test men and women. there is not a difference however when it comes to angiograms, women by far, get unnecessary procedures and the reason is, because they do a whole bunch of tests before they do the angiogram. they do a stress test. put you on a cardio machine, measure your heart rate. women put off false positives it looks like on paper wow, there is something wrong with their heart when they go in and look there is nothing wrong. this would be a perfect test to kind of counter balance that. instead you get a blood test if it showed you had a blockage then the women could go in. it would significantly impact how many women are over prescribed angiograms. for me, you are describing all this giving us information, but you are a local reporter here in san diego is there a san diego connection. there is. a doctor from scripps institute of science, he did the study on this, he validated an fda study and basically what that means the fda doesn't necessarily have to have strict guidelines for diagnostic tests like this he went back and said i am skeptical i don't believe this. this isn't going to work did a huge study 30 centers across the country including scripps green hospital and found it does work and now he is an enthusiastic supporter the study was done here in san diego and on the market already. well, finally peggy, i mean people are going to hear this report, get really interested in pursuing it, when will it be available for the general public? my understanding is that it is made by cardio diax in palo alto what can happen your doctor can order it they will need to order it and get it done at the hospital it will take patients saying hey, what about that new genetic blood test. but it is available now. thank you very much. good to be here.",

        "video_sub_title": "hey everyone so i'm back again today was another tutorial i'm sticking with the summer team for this makeup look and i've created a nice cosh crease smokey eye with a pop of color on the lid so this look is perfect for anybody who wants to add color to their makeup who wants to do so in a subtle manner my favorite thing about this look is the versatility of it you can use any color you want on the lid the choice is yours and if you want to see my crazy then just keep watching so you know the drill by now the most important thing to do before applying your eyeshadow is to prep and prime the eye area so i'm taking an eyelid primer and i'm applying it anywhere that i'm going to be placing down eyes shadows to ensure they last all day long and appear as vibrant as possible to give the colorful eyeshadows an added boost i'm taking a white eyeshadow base and applying this all over the eyelid and i'm taking a synthetic brush and i'm just blending out the color nine times out of ten for any smokey eye i create i use the same colors in the crease and they just act as a nice transition color to give you that really nice diffused effect so i've taken two different types of skin tone shades one is lighter than the other and i've just applied this in the crease of the eye once i've laid down those colors i'm going to go in with a brown eyeshadow and i'm just going to take this in the deepest part of my crease and i'm actually going to start to cut the crease so this is great if you have hooded eyelids because you can create your own crease and give yourself that really nice open eyed effect so once i have drawn down my line then i'm going to blend my eyeshadows upwards from there and then i'm going to take a blending brush and i'm just going to soften out those edges to ensure that we have no harsh lines so i'm working in my way from light to dark so next i'm taking this black eyeshadow and i'm going to use this at the base of that line so in the deepest part of my crease and this is going to add some depth and definition to the core crease effect and then i'm going to slightly blend that color upwards to meet the brown now for the pop of color on the lid i am taking this blue eyeshadow and you can use any color you want i just chose blue today and i'm applying it halfway across the eyelid and then i'm going in with an off - white eyeshadow and i'm applying this on the remaining half of the lid and you want to remember to bring it up to that coast crease line to give the illusion of bigger eyes to add some more dimension to the blue eye shadow i'm taking a slightly darker blue and i'm just applying this on the outer corner of my eye and blending it in with the blue that we've already laid down then i'm just going to draw a line angling from the lower lash line up to the end of my brow to connect that brown eye shadow in the crease i'm just going to further intensify that black in the crease by taking a smaller liner brush and just drawing over that shape then i'm going to blend this up again into the brown to make sure everything fades together to add a highlight to my brow bone i'm going to go in with this white eyeshadow and i'm starting off by dashing it along the arch of my brow towards the stars and end of my brow once i've laid down the color then i'm going to lightly blend it out i didn't want to use a black on the waterline so i took this nice turquoise shade and just applied that and then i'm going to use a brown eyeshadow the dark brown again i'm applying this halfway across the lower lash line and i'm applying the black on the outer third of the eye to finish off the eye makeup look i'm going in with a couple of coats of mascara to my top and bottom and here's a quick look at the finished eyes and now we're going to move on to the face so i'm sick at the moment of my skin's quite dry and dehydrated so i've applied a light layer foundation and then i'm going to use this luminous powder and i'm just applying it where i need it on my face my t - zone is always quite dry so i'm just applying it to the outer areas of my face and then go to bronze up my skin using this one by physicians formula and i'm just applying the contour color into the hollows of my cheeks and then i'm going to add some light to my face by applying a highlighter to the tops of my cheekbones i didn't want the lips to compete with the eyes so i just went for a nude lipstick and then i'm going to top it off for the gloss and i don't normally do this but i like to wear my lips are quite dry it makes them look a bit more hydrated and full and that's the finished look so i hope you enjoyed the tutorial and thanks millie for watching",

[UNK] - hi folks, i'm bob schrupp, physical therapist. - brad heineck, physical therapist. - and we are the most famous physical therapists on the internet. - in our opinion, of course, bob. - today, we're going to talk about thumb and wrist pain relief, how to fix de quervain's, you say a little different than me - - de quervain's. - de quervains tenosynovitis. this is, the simple word is texting thumb, and we'll talk about what that is. - sure, you bet. - by the way, if you new to our channel, please take a second to subscribe to us. we provide videos, how to stay healthy, fit, pain free, and we upload every day. go to bobandbrad. com. go to the giveaway section. we're always giving something away. you got to check it out. - yeah! - it's kind of surprising every week. this week we're giving away the booyah stick. - booyah. yeah, you can use it for a lot of things like shoulder pain and back pain. you can always find the contest pinned to the top of the page on facebook or twitter, instagram, or tik tok, if you want a 60 second version of our program. - there you go, bob. - all right, so, we're talking about pain at the base of your thumb right here. now that could also be arthritis, but if it's over the tendons here, i'm going to show you this. i don't know if you can see - - bob, a lot of people think the base of the thumb is way up here, but - - [ bob ] right. - [ brad ] actually it's way down by the wrist. - [ bob ] can you see those two tendons there? - [ brad ] well, of course i can, they're right in front of me. - yeah. just so, believe it or not, this is three tendons. this is one tendon here, and there's two that run right through here. this is where the pain usually is. - [ brad ] yeah, that's called anatomical snuffbox. - yeah, this is where they could actually take snuff tobacco and sniff it into their nose. - [ brad ] is that what they did? - i think so. - well anyways, that's what they, and yeah, you can look it up in medical dictionary. - yeah, so anyway, i got it once. you get it from texting, repetitive texting. i didn't get it from that, i got it years ago when i was a waiter, - oh really? - in physical therapy school and i was carrying all the plates like this. - oh really? - you know what i mean? - you should've known better. - i should've known better. i eventually turned my hand. - oh, you did, okay. - but if you're using a clipper, like to clip, a hedge clipper. - right, yeah. what about people that cut hair? - sure. - maybe they have it. - yep, that would be doing any repetitive type of task. so the tendons there, they get inflamed or swelling, there might be microtrauma. after a while you actually get adhesions, and you might get some scar tissue there. - so it just becomes a irritable thing that drags on, and... - so i'm going to show you three signs, first, that you have it. - okay. - first one's real simple. if you rub your thumb on here and it hurts, it's tender. - right cross over it like that? - yep, now, if you take your thumb and go up like this, just straight up like this, and push against it, and that hurts on the base of the thumb - - oh, muscle tendon unit test, yeah. - that's a sign, yep. or you take the thumb up and back, and i'm going to push it back this way, if that hurts. - just stressing the tendon and... - the simplest test still is called the finkelstein test. i love this thing here. you just actually take your thumb and grab it, put it inside your palm, and grab it like this. now, do this gently because this could hurt. now you're going to bend your wrist that way. - [ brad ] but you got a lot of range of motion in that joint. i can't believe you can do that, wow. - [ bob ] what, you got motion. - [ brad ] not that much, you got your, oh my goodness. anyways, this, i feel the stretch, on a healthy one. - i feel it on even healthy one, yep. - i see why this would be a real true one. - so that, if you have all three of those, you probably have texting thumb. we're going to show you what to do. now, what they have found, and this is from robin mckenzie, who treats a lot of backs, and he's since passed away, but he's got a lot of books that are really quite helpful for treating - - right, and these went out to the arms, and the legs, and the extremities, just a - - so his book called, for you therapists out there. it's the human extremities, mechanical diagnosis and therapy. i think that we should give a plug for that in there. - absolutely. - alright, so we're going to go ahead, we're going to treat these two tendons. it's the abductor pollicis longus and the extensor pollicis brevis, for those who may want to know. we're going to start with this one here. so, we're going to go thumb extension, which means we're going back like that. and we're going to put a thumb on there just when it's starting to head back. so, - right there? - yep, i'm going to put my thumb on there, right when it holds back one, two, three. one, two, three. - so you're putting pressure. - one, two, three, right over the tender spot. one, two, three. one, two, three. - how many times? - 10 times. - 10. - or you can say the words too, pressure on, pressure off. it's about the same thing, one, two, three. - and then have someone else count. - yeah, pressure on, pressure off. pressure on, pressure off. now you're also going to do that, that was thumb extension, you're going back. now, this one is thumb abduction, where you're just going away this way. - away from the pointer finger? - away from the pointer finger, that you're going to do the same thing. pressure on, pressure off. - i'm going to use my finger. could i do it that way? - pressure on, pressure off. i think no matter what you want, however you want to put pressure on that tendon, you can do it. pressure on, pressure off. now this should not make it worse to any large extent. if it is, it's too fired up, maybe you're going to have to ice it or use some anti - inflammatories. - he doesn't recommend using a splint or a brace for treatment? - not really. not really. you do want to avoid activities that - - irritate it? - irritate it, right all right. do that for, i'd do it for a couple of days. well, you gotta see how it responds. if it's responding pretty well, you're going to go to the next one where you actually just put the hand off the table, and you put the thumb up against the forefinger, the pointer finger. - yeah, number two, digit number two. - number two, yeah. this is one, two, three, four, five. so you're just going to do some ulnar and radial deviation like this. - so, we're stretching it when we go down and we come up we're actually - - [ bob ] yeah, you know, the tendon is gliding through that sheath. you're trying to smooth it out a little bit. - kind of makes me want to rock when i do that, but i don't have to. - yeah, you got all sorts of issues, don't you, brad? all right, next one. you're going to go ahead and put the entire hand on the table now. and now you're going to put pressure on the tendon the entire time while the thumb is extending. so we're going to go and bring the thumb back. there isn't much motion there, but i'm bringing it up and back. - right. - so, up and back. - like i was trying to look over the backside, but - - keeping pressure on there the entire time. - all the time? - yep. now brad, you have found this has worked well for your trigger finger, right? you just said - - right, obviously the pressure is at a completely different location, but yeah, it works very well for my trigger finger. is it the same concept as? - same concept, yep. we're trying to smooth out that sheath. you know, if there's any rough spots in there, so you would do extension, but you'd also do abduction, which is just straight this way. again, moving straight away from the second finger. - then we do this? - so a - - horizontal abduction? - no, we don't do that. - oh, okay. - these two muscles don't do that. - right. i just thought maybe we would do it for the fun of it. - well, it wouldn't hurt, i'm sure. - not necessary. - so once this, you find out this works, you're always going to do it 10 times each direction. you can do it throughout the day. you don't just do this once a day, you know. - right, every one to two hours. - yep, that's usually the best thing. you know, they'll say six to eight times a day even, as much, and i mean, that's what's going to help this move along. i mean, it's amazing how long this stuff can stick around if you don't treat it. - right. you know what i mean? - and as well as avoid doing the things that irritate it. - right. - and that's a big, big part of it. - and that's tough to do, you know, everybody's communicating with their phone now. and some people send hundreds of texts a day. now, i'm not one of them, but, and i guess you can do the voice text too, right? - sure, yeah. we call it transcribing into the phone. - sure. is that still a word? - i don't even know. - brad just used the word sas on me. that just threw me off. you were sas - ing me. - oh. - what? - yeah well you was. - all right. remember brad and i can fix just about anything. - [ brad ] except for... - a sasy - y heart. well, we're working on it. a broken heart, a broken heart, but we're working on it. - take care - thanks for watching. take care of that thumb.",

        "video_sub_title": "here's another daily tip from your local dermatologist. another tip from your local dermatologist, and this one has to do with jock itch. now jock itch is a problem where you start to grow a fungus or a yeast in your groin area. and most of the time this occurs, because when people get out of a shower or a bath, they don't dry off completely. and so what happens is, skin comes in contact with skin, and it never dries out, and that's the perfect breeding ground for yeast or fungus to grow. so please dry off completely. some people will use a hair dryer and don't use heat on it, but just blow air into the areas where skin on skin is contacted. other people try other tricks. but i'd much rather you make sure that area is dried from simple air, then adding things like talcum powder, or other powders that can bunch and clump, and actually promote moisture. if we can get those areas dry when we're bathing, chances are we're not going to have as many issues with jock itch.",

        "video_sub_title": "this video is sponsored by skill share with the winter months finally upon us one thing that i've often struggled with is seasonal depression certainly the first snowfall in minnesota looks magical and yet it also carries with it a sense of dread the dread of a long dark ominous winter ahead and invariably i've found that my mental health has taken a toll this winter i want to be more conscious about my mental health and so for the last week i've been researching ways to keep mental health strong and in particular ways that you can keep dopamine levels high dopamine is the neurotransmitter that is associated with the anticipation of pleasure and high natural dopamine levels are linked with reduced addictive behavior better enthusiasm motivation a willingness to take on more motion and it's key it's paramount to feeling good this winter the ideas for this video come from two books the molecule of moore and the neurogenesis diet and lifestyle alongside a couple of online articles and research papers but i will link all of my sources in the description box and so the first principle the single most important thing you can do this winter to keep your mental health high your dopamine levels high is to wake up without an alarm this is an idea that i got from tom bilyeu of impact theory he has often talked about how waking up without an alarm getting as much sleep as your body needs naturally is the single most powerful thing you can do sleep is the highest return on investment research shows that lack of sleep down regulates dopamine receptors and reduces dopamine receptor availability and sensitivity in the brain if you've been generally speaking be asleep between 10 : 00 p. m. and 12 : 00 a. m. and wake up whenever your body feels naturally inclined to do so you will stand a much better chance of being cognitively optimized this is the single most powerful thing you can do for your brain and perhaps also the most difficult because i do like to get up early and i am someone who often gives into the hustle culture of the times but it is important i think to remind yourself that getting sleep it's not a luxury it's one of the best things you can do for yourself principle number two eat a neurogenesis inducing diet in particular focus protein especially the amino acid tyrosine and a couple of micronutrients i read a book called the neurogenesis diet and lifestyle the author of that book makes a case for four superfoods in particular that give you the highest return on investment when it comes to neurogenesis making new brain cells and being cognitively optimized those are blueberries sources of omega - 3s such as avocados curcumin and green tea principle number three cut out sugar this was perhaps the most insightful and profound part of my research although none of what i'm saying is probably gonna be all that profound something you might have heard before but sugar is actually pretty strongly linked to depression and anxiety rodents fed high - fat high - sugar diets showed a decrease in bdnf levels other reasons for this link is that sugar is associated with increased inflammation and exaggerated insulin response and because of its addictive effects these could all be affecting the dopaminergic neurotransmission mechanism from sugar don't it will kill you i'm actually in the midst of a 30 day no sugar challenge right now and i am excited to see how it might affect my mental clarity and my inflammation sometimes i do feel extra achy after a workout and i'm curious to see if this might have an effect on it it is kind of a difficult time of year to try to reduce sugar intake but if you can it might improve mental health and clarity over the winter months principle number four get exercise especially aerobic exercise if you can physical exercise is one of the best things you can do for your brain this was the central tenet of john brady's book called spark but exercise increases bdnf brain - derived neurotrophic factor in the brain by up to a thousand percent and it certainly is linked with elevated mood reduced depression and greater levels of dopamine of course there's nothing new with this principle but at times i do convince myself that i need to go straight to the office rather than get my morning workout in and invariably when i do get the mental poison out when i workout when i sweat it out it makes a profound difference on my day so if you can just winter focus on exercise principle number five meditation there have been over a thousand studies on the benefit of meditation and several studies have linked it directly to higher dopamine levels one such study was by the john f kennedy institute in denmark but i've been a huge advocate of meditating i think it's one of the better things you can do for yourself and i'm certainly gonna try to put even more of a focus on meditating this winter to not miss sessions to get it done and to treat it like a daily discipline that i have to show up to every day principal number six invest in deep learning perhaps one of the better things you can do in terms of neurogenesis and forming new dendritic connections in the brain is to be excited about learning and have things on the docket that you're continually working on several years ago i had read a book called the talent code and it talked about how learning actually affects the myelin sheath of the brain which is the coating that goes around the axons of your neurons in your brain and it makes synapses fire faster so by learning you actually cause your brain to get stronger more resilient less depressive and actually grow i mentioned this also because this video is sponsored by skillshare if you don't know already skillshare is an online platform taught by world - class educators on topics in business marketing film editing i am particular really benefited recently from a course on productivity by thomas frank and i've also started a final cut pro x course by ollie abdul and i'm really enjoying it online education is actually something that i'm a deep advocate of because it changed my life the reason that i have a job that i'm really happy with today is because of self - study online and skillshare is a fantastic platform by which you can teach yourself skills that are relevant that are exciting and that can get you closer to your goals if you use my link below for a limited time you will get a two - month free trial to using skillshare i highly recommend you check it out and thank you skillshare for sponsoring this video and supporting so many creators that i love on this platform and the final principle cold showers now the results behind this have been somewhat inconclusive there was one study in particular that every online source mentioned which said that dopamine levels could be increased by 250 percent by cold showers this might work because of the high density of cold receptor in the skin a cold shower could send an overwhelming amount of electrical impulses from peripheral nerve endings to the brain which could result in an anti - depressive effect but at least from anecdotal evidence i can tell you that cold showers have been one of the fastest ways i've elevated my mood it works almost every single time that i feel better after a cold shower i'm not sure why but it's fantastically invigorating and even though it's brutally hard to take them in the winter months i think they're especially beneficial in the winter so if you're up for it if you're feeling brave if you're feeling the viking spirit in you take a cold shower this winter and see how it affects you these are the seven principles the seven most powerful ways that i could come up with of how you can have higher dopamine levels this winter better mental health and even though none of these principles should be that surprising to hear about i think it is important to remember the basics remember the fundamentals and especially to focus on taking care of your mental health this coming winter that's it for today thank you guys for watching and i will see you in the next one cheers [ music ] you",

        "video_sub_title": "i'm gonna share with you five tips that helped me reduce my hba1c test results from 13 to 6 % so if you want to lower your a1c test results keep watching let's go my name is tom i've been type 1 diabetic for over 30 years and on this channel i share my diabetes journey with you when i was a teenager my a1c results were as high as 13. 3 % and if you're a diabetic you know that these levels are extremely high it actually means that my average blood sugar at that time was around 18 millimole high blood sugar like this can cause a major damage to your body in the long term a few nights my blood sugar happened to be so high that my body needed to pee when i was sleeping but didn't wake me up and i beat all over my bed while sleeping and at that point in time i said to myself this has to stop over time i have been able to reduce my a1c levels to 6 percent and i consider this an excellent achievement and i know you can do this too so here are my 5 favorite tips that helped me to get to these levels but please keep in mind i'm just a diabetic just like you and all i share here is just my personal experience i'm not a medical professional and you should consult any treatment decisions with your doctor tip number one is to set realistic goals for your next a one - seat test my goals and my teenage years were more around pretty girls than my hba1c levels but what my mom asked me if i think a girl we want to share a bed with a guy who pees in his pants i realized i have to change the strategy behind my goals and that's when i first started working on my hba1c really actively my first goal was to reduce it from a thirteen point three percent to ten percent within the next six months it was back then when i realized it's very important to have these realistic goals because when you see your goal when you feel it only then you have a reason to go after it and protect it so if your a1c is 13 set your next go to 12 it's okay if it's 10 set your next go to nine point five it's okay if you're a 1c is six point five which by the way would be extremely good set your next goal for six point three it's okay from my experience when the goal is realistic it's much easier to achieve it and once you achieve your first goal it will motivate you to stretch your next goal even lower in this overview you can see where approximately your average blood sugar needs to be so that you can meet your goal so make the goal challenging but realistic tip number two avoid huge blood sugar spikes you can do that by reducing the amount of toxic carbs that you eat and by toxic carbs i mean pasta white rice white bread any kind of sugary drinks these spike your blood sugar's like crazy and it's very difficult and very challenging to effectively pose for them when i was a teenager i secretly egular of sweets and and drunk coke and i mean coke not diet coke stupid once i stopped doing that i so significant improved to my hba1c levels now i'm on a low - carb diet trying to eliminate carbs completely or at least reduce fast - acting carbs with slow - acting carbs like brown rice potatoes whole - grain bread whole grain pasta this really helps me avoid huge spikes in my blood sugar's if you want to keep eating fast carbs make sure to propose for them since i usually forget to priebus i'd rather stick to my low - carb diet but it's up to you tip number 3 and i'm sure everybody watching this video already knows that you need to test your blood sugar frequently before and after meals this way you can identify blood sugar patterns and times of days or activities during which your blood sugar has tendency to go too high by frequently testing you can also identify what exactly is causing your blood sugars to spike and you can turn eliminate it this can be specific food stress specific time of day and so on once you identify these patterns it's much easier to tackle them if you can you should totally get continuous glucose monitoring system aka cgn this helps you monitor your blood sugar's 24 / 7 without pricking your finger all the time for me this was a game changer and the only one thing that contributed the most to my improved a1c levels tip number 4 identify was already working and tried to build and these can be specific physical activities specific very routines or specific exercises that help you reduce stress once you see those are working try to implement them more to your lifestyle going slowly step by step tip number five identify your support group it's very important someone who will support you on the way to improve a1c and it can be your doctor but also your diabetic friend a diabetic coach and the whole diabetes community since i started making videos on youtube i discovered there is such a great community online on facebook and youtube where you can connect with so many experienced diabetics who are battling to exactly the same battle as you and getting inspiration from those was extremely valuable for me and making videos for you on this channel makes it even more of a motivation for me to improve improve my levels improve my blood sugar's so i want to thank you for that you can find so many great videos here in the youtube space the creators are like our mission or lord she's diabetic between two lines so check out their channels i'll link them in the description below question of the day for you what is your favorite tip for lowering your a1c levels please write in the comments and share your favorite tips with the diabetes community the one thing that helped me lower my a1c the most was getting started with the freestyle libre system if you want to learn more about freestyle debray check the playlist on the screen now i will see you in my next type 1 tom's video ciao",

        "video_sub_title": "hey folks matt from wayne health synergy wanted to talk to you about hydrogen peroxide oh - basically hydrogen peroxide has a lot of uses you probably heard about a lot of them most people have a bottle of hydrogen peroxide in the house in case you get a cut or your kids get a cut you know i skinned your knee you put a little hydrogen peroxide on it to clean it before you put a bandaid on it now what a lot of people don't realize is hydrogen peroxide can be used for a lot of other things and one of the big ones that i use it for is for brushing my teeth and for dental hygiene basically it's a great way to brush your teeth it has the added side benefit of whitening your teeth if you look at some of these really expensive tooth whiteners that you buy that's what they are they're like six to eight percent hydrogen peroxide so why spend all that money when you can get hydrogen peroxide a lot cheaper than that so the other big thing when you brush your teeth with hydrogen peroxide i usually gargle with it and brush my teeth with it and what i find is it really cuts down if not totally eliminates colds and flus and other viruses you might catch because hydrogen peroxide kills off that type of stuff and so it's it's cleansing your mouth purifying and disinfecting it not only that it's whitening your teeth so and cleaning them so and you just it's it's really nice because it has a nice clean your mouth feels nice and clean and fresh afterwards you don't have the taste of sugary toothpaste or anything like that in your mouth and so it's really good for your teeth i was i went through a period where i'm terrible for remembering the floss and my dentist was like hey you really got to start flossing your gums are getting bad and he had one of those new cameras it comes in your mouth and shows you guys i thought wow i gotta do some both a tray and i have to say that i'm still terrible at flossing my teeth but the next time i went back to the dentist he's like hey whatever you're doing keep it up that looks good you've been flossing and i was like no i haven't that he's that cool what have you been doing i says i've been brushing my teeth and i've been gargling and with using it as a mouthwash with hydrogen peroxide well keep it up it's working great so basically i was starting to get some some gum problems and the hydrogen peroxide fixed that and healed them right up so not only is it great for your teeth it's really good for your gum health and it really cuts down and if not eliminates sore throats colds those type of viruses if you feel cold coming on you can use hydrogen peroxide you can gargle with it a little more especially if you get a sore throat coming on i've often used it to to stop that in the in the works so as soon as you start to feel it just catch it in the bud nip it in the bud so a lot of people also you'll still find use hydrogen peroxide to prevent colds or to stop colds there's an old theory has been around since the early 1930s and apparently there was a lot of research on it that colds actually enter through the ear canal and that if you catch the cold in the early stages with a couple of drops of hydrogen peroxide in the ear canal then you'll you'll you'll cure the cold you'll kill the cool before it even starts apparently it is effective if you if you're late and you kept on you're applying it after the colds already gone through your body and it's full - blown just not as effective so you want to catch it right away hydrogen peroxide super cheap you want to make sure you get food grade hydrogen peroxide be using it as a mouthwash brushing your teeth you can use just the regular bottles of hydrogen peroxide in the store the difference with those is when they process them because it's not meant to be ingested it's something you're gonna spit out there could be some by - product or things in there you don't really want if you're gonna take hydrogen peroxide at all internally or you want put in your ears or anything i just like to have the food - grade of it the hydrogen peroxide i get i get 35 percent hydrogen peroxide and it's food great and then i dilute it myself so i get a liter of it for $ 15 the hydrogen peroxide you buy in the store is 3 % so this here basically is going to give me 10 liters of hydrogen peroxide so that's an awful lot of hydrogen peroxide bottles you buy in the store not leader there about half liter so and it's food great so it's great for all sorts of uses because it is food green one of the other things people do is if you see that in the h2o supplements and things that are the the oxygen supplements and oxygen liquid oxygen and oxygen drops and whatnot that's basically it's not hydrogen peroxide i believe that's a sodium chloride molecule or something at some type of sodium so it's actually not the greatest rate because it's just it's high in salt but the hydrogen peroxide will do the same thing so if you dilute the hydrogen peroxide you say you put a couple drops and a little juice glass of water and drink that you're gonna oxygenate your body and you can oxygenate yourself that way without spending the money on the additional supplements the other thing with hydrogen peroxide is that when you're brushing your teeth and gargling with it and things like that you're gonna oxygenate yourself that way too because it'll get absorbed in through the soft tissue in your mouth so what you want to do if you're gonna go the route that i do with the food grade 35 percent is be very careful because that 35 percent it is quite volatile it will burn your hand that it's it can hit it does hurt i've spilled it on myself so you got to be very careful with it because it's concentrated at this at this level but once you've mixed it up you'll find that most of the mouthwashes for teeth whitening and the teeth whiteners are six to ten percent if you check on the bottles in the stores you'll see that and then the ones that you spend even more money for the if device for your dentist are even higher so i usually mix this up at around six to eight percent and that's perfectly safe to brush with and to to gargle with and whatnot and then you can dilute that a bit more if you want if you're looking to ingest it or put drops in your ears or whatnot so just be really careful when you if you're gonna go the route of getting the the concentrated stuff and dilute your own because it is pretty intense concentration so you want to dilute that make sure you you do the right math and do the right dilution you don't want to hurt yourself by not having it diluted enough so anyways that's a little bit on hydrogen peroxide how to use it for you know it's it's great for a mouthwash it's great for brushing your teeth with it keeps your dental hygiene great and it's really good for preventing and stopping colds and flu and sore throats and things like that so thanks for tuning in folks stay tuned and we'll be back soon with some more health tips and some more weight loss advice thanks a lot you",

        "video_sub_title": "i don't know what it is about these gloves, but putting on sterile gloves makes people panic. so today we're gonna talk about how to put them on and take them off so that you don't break sterility. right after this. welcome back my name is tammy and this is nurseminder and on this channel we do everything nursing so if you're new here consider subscribing below so that you get the next video when it's released. so today we're talking about sterile gloves ; how to put them on and how to take them off. now it's important to know why you're using sterile gloves because there are non sterile gloves out there as well. in sterile gloves you might be doing a dressing change in which you want to protect the patient from microorganisms from the surface around them and from yourself ; you may be working with patients bodily fluids and you don't want to get contaminated ; or maybe you're giving medications that are cancer - causing and you need that extra layer of protection. whether you are working in home care, whether you are caring for somebody who lives at home, or you're working in the hospital sterile gloves protect both you and the patient. so let's talk about what we need to do to get prepared. one of the first things we need to know is how to identify sterile versus non sterile. if you see gloves in a box like this - non sterile! we will use these to help clean our station but they're not going to be the ones we use for our procedure. all right so what we're looking for in a sterile package is in fact that it is in a sterile wrapped container, sleeve - and we know that it's sterile because the package tells us that it is. so i'm going to bring this up close and we can see that it says it is sterile. the other thing we're going to look at our package is to make sure we have the right size, so these ones are a medium. we need to look at the expiry date and then we need to inspect the package itself to make sure there's no rips or tears in those seams. so for example if this was the package i picked up, it's already open i can see there's contamination these would go in the garbage. so i've gathered the right package and now i know i'm going to get my table ready because i need to make sure i have a sterile surface to work with my sterile gloves. so let's head to the table. okay so here we are at the workstation and one of the first things i want to do is make sure my work area is clean, so i'm gonna put on a clean glove, grab a disinfecting towelette, and wipe down my surface area. in this video, i'm going to be demonstrating the donning and doffing of gloves from two angles ; first from the side as we are currently and then i will move the camera so that you can see it from your positioning as you if were actually putting on the gloves. so now that my area is clean and i've got that in the garbage, i'm going to now take my sterile gloves and i'm gonna open up my package. so as i'm opening up my first sterile package the first layer will reveal the second package which are the sterile gloves. you want to be able to put this down so that you can read the writing and i will just flip this around here so i can do that. some will have a right and a left picture on there and either way we're going to open it up and we are going to then unfold the top and bottom flaps ; and then you'll notice there's also a flap down the medial - the middle - we're going to put our fingers under there and pull open the paper. now we visualize we have a right and a left glove, they are folded so that the cuff is up towards the thumb on each glove. i'm going to start with my non - dominant hand and grabbing the cuff of the dominant glove, i make an opening so i can slide my right hand into the glove. i want to be careful that i'm only touching that area of the glove and i let it go once my glove is seated. my right hand is now sterile and i need to stay on the inside of the cuff on the left handed glove ; so i'm going to put my fingers between the cuff and the glove, make an opening and slide my left hand into the glove. with this, as the glove is proceeding above my wrists, i can now extend that glove keeping my fingertips only on that portion and release. you can see i probably should have taken my watch off ahead of time. i can now take my gloved hand under the cuff of the first glove and extend that one, and release as well. seat those fingers in tight and you are ready to go. in removing the glove i'm going to take the inside cuff of one glove pull, it up and down over my fingers, keeping all of the contamination controlled ; then i'm going to slip my clean hand under the cuff of my remaining glove and do the same ; such that the gloves will fold onto each other and controlling the contamination. now let's take a look at this from another angle. step 1, let's open my package. inside this one will be a second sterile package that contains my gloves. i see that they are medium. i can read the packaging so i'm now going to go ahead and open this second sterile package. unfold the top and the bottom flaps and then along the middle you can see the other flap that you'll put your fingers underneath and pull open. you can now see the gloves have a cuff that goes up towards the thumbs on both the right and left glove. using my left hand, i'm going to create an opening at the base of the right glove so i can slide my right hand in ; dropping the cuff. my now right hand is sterile. i'm going to go underneath the cuff of the left handed glove, create a pocket so that my left hand can slip into the glove, and as you're sliding your glove on you may notice that your fingers don't always go into the right spot - that is okay - just take a moment ; extend the cuff and drop it. now you can take your sterile left hand under the cuff of the right hand extend it and drop. seat the fingers, make sure the gloves are nice and snug and you're ready to go. now at the end of your procedure you want to remove those gloves. grasp the inside cuff of one hand pull it down towards your fingers, containing all the contamination inside. slip your clean hand under the cuff of the remaining glove and do the same. removing both gloves together and now all i need to do is wash your hands and you're done. so there you have it. it's actually a pretty straightforward process. so let's do a quick summary. number one : are you needing sterile gloves or clean gloves? you need to make that distinction. number two : gather your supplies and clean your station number. three : open up your gloves maintaining sterility and put one glove on at a time ; using those techniques i've shown you. number four : when you take them off, you want to make sure you still maintaining sterility. there's nothing worse than putting body fluids on your hand and then you have to go and clean it up ; so follow those principles and you won't go wrong. now it does take practice so don't be afraid to reset your package and do it over and over again until you are perfect.",

        "video_sub_title": "hey it's dr. trish lee let's talk about mist agnes for just a minute because i'm working with more and more people with nystagmus helping them to overcome this debilitating visual impairment that makes it so that their quality of life tanks because if you're not able to see well you're not able to drive you're not able to participate in college classes your quality of life struggles that's not what i'm here to tell you what i'm here to tell you is that the brain pattern behind the stagnant is one of too much slow processing speed in the brain coupled with too much extra fast brain processing speed and what that means is the brain was likely born processing a little bit slower speed which is an organic pattern it's associated with attention difficulties with any type of developmental delay so if you needed speech or anything like that when you're younger those things are associated with a slower running brain pattern what happens is the extra fast brain pattern is comorbid it co exists with the slow brain pattern so over your lifetime your brain has had to ramp it up into extra fast speed to be able to offset that slowing so what that means for you is now your brain is using too much extra slow and too much extra fast and not enough perfect processing speed here in the middle so the key to reducing and olivier ting alleviating the stagnant is to reduce the slow processing speed in the brain reduce the extra fast processing speed in the brain and increase perfect processing speed in the middle that's exactly what neurofeedback can do for you if you struggle with nystagmus now i have to tell you it's all scientific it's all totally measurable and when people work with us you can go to my website at dr. trish lee calm or my professional website at lee brain and spine comm and you'll get lots of information there about neurofeedback but the idea is when you work with us we share that data of how your brain is performing with you frequently so you're always in the know of how your brain is performing how that performance pattern is improving and that will correlate with your symptom reduction it's all measurables never like i think this thing is going great how do you think it is i see your brain performance pattern improving here's the proof and now your symptoms are also getting better as well okay so go to my blog post at dr. trish lee calm because there's also an exercise that you can use to start to improve your nough statements by yourself it will work a million percent better if you're doing it in conjunction with neurofeedback which is shifting your brain into the better pattern but italy still be a start and you'll have a tool in your tool bag that you can try so visit dr. trish lead calm and remember control your brain or it'll control you",

        "video_sub_title": "the mighty english longbow over six foot long hewn from the finest materials known to man oh a tiny tiny little one like this one hello folks and welcome to another richard hit longbows video longbow well it is a longbow and but it's just not very long that's cuz that's eight child's along the bow it still has the same width depth ratios so for therefore making it a longbow and it's also got the buchanan dips so it's got a handle section and two independently working limbs it's actually a triple laminate we've got hickory on the back here and bamboo on the belly and it's got the same handle that we'd put on any of our adult bows so you've got the woolen braid and you've got the leather gold leaf trim top and bottom have a look at this footage i've taken of it next to a normal bow or an adult sized bow which is actually a self you bow you can really see that difference in the size of the handle the size of the limbs how much more tiny they are on that child's bow and also through to the knocks you can really see how dainty those victorian knocks are how small they are compared to an adult sized bow we've even managed to squeeze our name there off the back this one has some rather nice features as well it's actually got some original victorian knocks made by the pearl family a friend of ours who we'll talk about in the second video because it's going to be a two - parter has done some research on the apparel family who made bows and arrows and have factories and what - have - you so these are original victorian knocks which are unused they made them lots of them and we can show you some of the collection we've got there of the various knocks that we were we were given direct from one of those factories before they went onto the bows so they divert assumably just chosen a pair that was suitable for the boat they were making and put those on so that's what we've done here with this child's bow air we've used some original child's boat knocks oh she's rather nice so in this series of videos i'm going to show you the making of these bows because we've had a commission rather nicely for some little kiddies that turned up with that it's rather sweet i think they were around two or three something like that i can't remember their ages now so that's the videos that we're going to be doing is showing you making a couple of these bows for those little kiddies as we're making bows full - time we often end up with off cuts and what better thing to do with them so these are the same quality materials so i've glued up here some hickory and some lemon wood and there will be banged up overnight so now i can unbind them and check that they're okay so i'm just leaving off the rubber here sister you know tubing a tire and a tubing that we use to clamp it all together so once i've got these undone i can take a look and see if they're okay or not well i've managed to get one of them unwrapped and that means i can get a closer look to make sure the adhesion is correct between the two laminations well that's both of them unwrapped and i can't stress how important it is to check that you have glued the laminations correctly and that they're all adhered to each other along their full length we've done a video on laminating and i'll put it up on the cards in the top right though modern glues are good it's worth checking if you have an overhang of one of the laminations if you have then chop that off before you do any of the work and risk having a problem now that we've done that it's time to do the marking act and one of the first things we need to do is to find our center line there so once i've done that with the measuring i can mark that center line there get the square right draw a nice neat line across and mark it with a c for center so i know which line is which that center line really is our jumping - off point to be able to mark the rest of the bow so now i can mark the handle i'm doing about half inch above and about three inch below now i've marked up top and bottom i can now get on to marking the sides so i've put a centerline top and bottom of the handle and marked out either side of it at about a half inch i can now join up those lines which will complete the full marking out of the handle now that centerline i can now use to find the center of the ends of the bow so that i can mark out the ends the tip end i'll use a piece of string and i'll show you how i do that in the next bit of video now to get that straight line we're going to use a piece of string just a simple loop in one end tighten it and run it along the bow so go from one end all the way down to the other end once you've got that secured you can then start to see whether that string actually meets up with the two center lines that we put onto the handle now you'll probably need to adjust them at either end until it does line up you could look down the end and look on the top of the back to see whether it lines up once you're happy you can then simply mark that string at either end of the bow that will give you your centerline in comparison to the center line that we created on the handle now that we have that central line at the tips we can mark out the width of those tips either side of that central line now we've got all our basic marks in place getting out of the meter rule is the next step and joining all the dots up and hoping that it comes out right if it does it should look a little something like this so we've joined up the handle you've joined up the tips we've got our center line so that hopefully those two limbs and run centrally down the back of the wood and meet up with the handle and now it's on with the bandsaw and to start doing the cutting out now the whole point of finding our central lines in both the handle and at the tips is to make sure that the stage that we're cutting out is going to be straight the laminated pieces of wood themselves may not be perfectly straight from one end to the other so because we've created a straight line that limbs and the handle through what may not be a straight piece of wood it means that some limbs are closer to the edge than the other so as you can see here i'm being quite careful and i'm cutting in a very small amount away this haven't got much room between the edge of the wood and where my line starts on the other side of the limb there you can see there's a lot more to cut but i'm gonna cut fairly generously either side and actually do some planing after i've done the cutting out once i finished cutting out down the back this will give us our width the dimensions we obviously need to cut the depth as well and they are basically the same measurement so that's quite easy to do and obviously be doing that next i will have to mark that up before i get round to doing that though here's what the state looks like now we cut those sides off as i said we've left a fair amount of room there either side of those lines so i'm gonna need to use the plane now to get rid of those get rid of the tool marks and get myself a little bit closer to that pencil line if we can okay that's where i'm going to leave it folks this is part one and in part two we'll obviously have done the depth cutting and it'll be time to do the roughing out and into the tillering and doing well the basic making of the bow so if you'd like to join me next time then please subscribe hit the notification bell and all that other groovy stuff and i'll see you again soon",

        "video_sub_title": "hi everyone! welcome back to my channel! today, i \u2019 m going to show you my favorite ways to wrap my pareo. this is something that we use in the polynesian culture. we basically use it for everything! i live in these things during the spring and summer time. i use it for hula practice, tahitian practice. so many things and ways to use it, so i thought i \u2019 d share my favorite ways! the first one is pretty much standard. you wrap it around your waist and i like to use a lot of fabric. this material didn \u2019 t have a lot of fabric, but i like to use a lot of fabric because that side tie right there, the bigger it is, i feel like the prettier it looks. the next wrap is super easy! this is something that i use for the beach, or if i \u2019 m at the pool. i \u2019 m just going to wrap the pareo around my body and you can cris cross it, or just keep it standard. but i \u2019 m just going to tie it above my chest and it \u2019 s so cute! you can wear it as a dress throughout the day in the house. i wouldn \u2019 t recommend wearing it out. i \u2019 m sure some do, especially in hawai \u2019 i, but for me, i like to wear it around the house because its simple and easy and comfortable. if you don \u2019 t like the bottom part flying open, you can also tie the bottom. this will keep it from flying open and ten to one, you \u2019 ll have a swimming suit underneath or some shorts. you just tie it at the bottom and pull it out and it \u2019 s just going to create this cute dress. it \u2019 s out of your way for walking, but it covers you up. this was one of the first wraps i \u2019 ve learned, in the hawaiian culture, if it is tied to the left side of you, that means that you are taken or married. and if it \u2019 s tied on the right, it means that you are single. a lot of people tie it on the left or right just because, but in the hawaiian culture that \u2019 s how it is. and in the tahitian culture, it \u2019 s the opposite way. and i do know my god mom is samoan, and she likes to tie it in the front. so i think it \u2019 s just a cultural thing. next, i \u2019 m going to show you how to do a cute little romper. you are going to take your pareo and you are going to wrap two of the corners after you have halved the pareo. you are going to tie the pareo so it \u2019 s tight and it doesn \u2019 t come loose. you are going to end up with a hole right here, and when you open it up, you \u2019 ll end up with two different holes. you are going to step your legs into both holes and i recommend using a lot of fabric for this, because it ends up being tight. my thunder thighs barely made it. but you are going to pull it up your body... and you can wrap it across or going straight up. i \u2019 m doing a regular tie in the back of my neck, it \u2019 s nothing fancy. then you are going to take the loose fabric in the middle and tie that as tight as possible. and tuck any loose ends of the fabric, this fabric has some little tassels at the bottom, so just tuck it all in. and you have your romper. now, if you don \u2019 t like to show that much skin in the center, you can cross / twist it and wrap it like you see here and just tie it together. super easy, super fun, super cute and that \u2019 s it! i hope you enjoyed my pareo tutorial. if you did, give this video a thumbs up! subscribe to my channel for more videos, and i \u2019 ll see yo in my next one!",

        "video_title": "How to Get Rid and Tame Frizzy Hair and What Causes Frizz-Beautyklove",
        "video_sub_title": "hi guys so today i'm going to be discussing the topic that you all have been asking me constantly on facebook and that is how do i get rid of the frizziness on my hair or how do i get rid of frizzy curls the first of all frist can happen to any hair texture even myself i also do experience frizz from time to time on my hair snow i can't speak for all hair textures because obviously probably the way you deal with frizz if your hair is curly and wavy is different and with me since i have straight to wavy hair because my hair is not really naturally like it's not super pin straight i have a tendency to have waves as well and i know that probably there are a lot of reasons why your hair or my hair gets frizzy but there's one thing that i really observed that really causes our hair to frizz and that is number one dryness if your hair is dry or if your hair is naturally dry your hair is prone to frizz all the time and dry hair can be caused by all sorts of things so let me just enumerate so first if your hair is chemically treated or if you have had like you know those hair treatments like those your bond or keratin treatments i mean they're really good at first it's gonna make your hair really soft and smooth and straight but if you don't maintain it or if you don't have a really good hair care routine the cons of that is that your hair is going to really dry out second one is bleaching now if you bleach your hair or if you constantly dye your hair oh you would definitely notice on frizz especially when the weather's humid or especially in summer number three if you constantly wash your hair with hot water now there's pros and cons to washing your hair with hot water when i say hot water not boiling hot or warm ish hot water what it does if you wash your hair with hot water it actually helps remove the dirt off your hair especially off your scalp and also it helps get rid of the excess oil and that's actually pretty much beneficial to do if you have oily hair i've tried that before and i think that it really works but here's the concept that by constantly washing your hair with hot water it opens the pores or the cuticles of your hair and it can actually make your hair overly porous that it can cost your hair to be dry and brittle now here are the things that can help stop frizz on your hair now you can either go for us have set products or you can go for the diy swear the diys i have a lot of diys you know like do to yourself i'm hair massive you can actually use to tame down the frizz in your hair um and i'm going to be just annotating them right here or for you people who are in the mobile i'm going to list that down in the description box and let me just say when it comes to products i really think that you know at the end of the day it's really up to you to just simply go ahead and use a product that works best for your hair because i can recommend something that would work for me and it might not work for your hair type or for your hair texture for me usually it's a trial and error to find a product that would really work best for my hair but if you guys still want my recommendation because a lot of you have been messaging me on facebook like how do i get rid of frizz like what products do i have to use to get rid of frizz if you still want my recommendation i'm going to put that in the description box down below i'm going to link everything that the products that i've been really liking or the products that i've been eyeing or the products that i have also been using her or the products that i want to try or like my must try products i'm going to be linking that in the description box down below so you guys can check it out if you want to alright so now that we got that out of the way number one this is one thing that has really helped me because i think that during the summer season my hair tends to be more dry so i really did get a lot of risk during that time on my hair and even if i put that in braids or like in hairstyles oh it's still breezy especially if you are in the philippines you definitely know how hot it is here during the summer so what i did is i deep condition my hair once a week now it really depends on how dry your hair is but for me i'm deep conditioning my hair once a week has really helped me a lot now the diy that i made with shea butter that one is very conditioning for the hair i find that it just really flattened out the cuticles and it really did get rid of the first on my hair ram is using that also after that i use my diy conditioning mask i then use apple cider vinegar apple cider vinegar also helps tame down the frizz so there's such a perfect combination and it also going to help get rid of the excess shea butter that you know that was applied on your hair so it kind of balances everything out so that's why i am going to recommend the apple cider vinegar rim it's totally beneficial for your hair so that's it it's either your deep condition your hair or you use a hair mask once a week now the second one is you sleep on or leave - in conditioners now what i like to do after you know i wash my hair and when my hair still wet i'm just going to go ahead and lather the leave on conditioner on my hair let my hair air dry and that's it now for some people leave on or leave in conditioner really works best for their hair but i find that during the summer to where my hair was really dry leave one and leave - in conditioners wasn't really enough for my hair cuz after once my hair was dried and after a couple of hours i still notice that i still have furs on my hair so what i did to fix that is actually use some oil serums or hair oils that you can actually leave in your hair um you can use coconut oil and stuff like that but for me the coconut oil that i'm using is actually organic so i cannot leave that on my hair so what i do is i actually use um an arrogant oil that looks like this is a morocco argan oil and i just leave that on my hair or as i've said as i've mentioned this before i'm using the l'oreal extraordinary oil that's a good oil to use too and also sometimes i use the l'oreal smooth intense anti - frizz serum also sometimes i use my dove daily hair vitamins i find that those things not only do they prevent frizz but also they add like fragrance and shine to your hair which is such a great bonus so that's why i like using hair oils and hair stores because you know i find that they can properly just moisturize your hair because you can apply them even if your hair is dry just to say backup i actually like using those serums now what you can do if you're experiencing frizz on top of your head you can actually you use a hair gel or a hair wax know what you can do with hair wax you can just simply just dab a little bit on your finger and then just rub it and then go ahead and flatten out the frizz on your hair but the thing is don't add a lot because if you add a lot of course your hair is going to be stiffed because i know that some of you don't like that oily kind of gross type of look if you actually combed your hair or if you just run your finger so as i've said just use a little bit of amount your hair is not going to look greasy or oily and you can also use gels i think it really depends on your hair texture as well and on your hair type and also if your hair is naturally wavy or curly i think it's best to already apply the products when your hair is still wet because it's way easy to manipulate your hair your hair is more manageable if your hair is wet and also so this is one thing that i find when i was working with a girl who has curly hair don't brush your hair when your hair is dry oh i know that's totally opposite to what um you know i've told you guys last time but but for curly hair i really find that brushing or curly to wavy hair i find that just brushing your hair when it's um dry mix a hair poofy so what you can do when your hair is wet you can actually use this wide toothed comb or you can actually use a detangling brush or a detangling comb just to avoid split ends and also this is one tip that i always tell you guys but it really helps a lot if you don't wash your hair every single day because what happens if you wash your hair every single day your hair actually the natural oils through your hair gets stripped off so in return your hair gets dry and when your hair gets dry gets really really dry your hair is prone to frizz especially if the weather is humid or especially if your hair is damaged or if you're bleaching your hair so i know some people they only wash their hair once a week so i hope you guys find this video helpful and i will see you all on my next video bye",

        "video_title": "How to Test for Dyslexia - Dyslexia Connect",
        "video_sub_title": "hey everyone peter here welcome to another episode of the dyslexia connects com dyslexia blog today i'm going to be talking about dyslexia testing and a question that i often get from parents is whether there is just simply i dyslexia tested you can take it home or easily take on the internet and the answer to that is unfortunately there is not an accurate test that you can just simply take on the internet or or get from a certain place send for get off the internet unfortunately with the complexity and different degrees of dyslexia that are out there there isn't simply a way to take a quick five minute test answer some questions and see if you or your child is dyslexic simply due to the complexity of it as mentioned in a previous blog episode dyslexia is neurological and as a result is very complex we see it in a lot of differing degrees a lot of people have different symptoms of dyslexia some dyslexics show certain symptoms some dyslexics don't and as a result there isn't any simple self test that you can do now you can be tested for dyslexia and there are very effective ways to do this and there are a couple of different ways to be tested for dyslexia there is what's called usually an informal dyslexia test or evaluation and there is also a formal dyslexia test and evaluation now what is the difference and how do you choose between these two different options let me give you some details about what they are on informal dyslexia evaluation is usually something that will just be done by a dyslexia tutor or maybe a psychologist or somebody who works a lot with dyslexics and is very familiar about the symptoms of dyslexia and how to identify them at just dyslexia connect calm we offer informal dyslexia evaluations and this is something that typically any alexia tutor who has some experience and proper training is able to do they're able to work with a student and say yep they show all these signs sign abcd they they're clearly dyslexic they're having a lot of difficulties like dyslexic typically have reading and spelling reading accuracy and all the other things that i mentioned that are typical signs of dyslexia so that's one type of dyslexia evaluation or test the other type is a formal evaluation now a formal evaluation is typically only done by a doctor a psychiatrist or a licensed psychologist now this of course is going to be much more involved and take a lot more time typically a formal evaluation is going to be fairly fairly lengthy it may require a half a day of testing maybe five hours six hours seven hours and usually the doctor or psychiatrist in this case will run the child or the adult who's being tested through a whole battery of tests and check them for many different things at once this is a very scientific approach and it's a great thing to do if you need an official evaluation now typically of course since these are done by psychiatrists and doctors this is going to be something that's much more expensive than a simple informal evaluation an informal evaluation since it's able to be done by a dyslexia tutor it's typically something that is much much more inexpensive and may simply be the cost of just one tutoring session just if you have a student work with the the tutor one time they may be able to say hey here are the clear signs of dyslexia that we're seeing here so those are your two options on informal evaluation or a formal evaluation now how do you choose between these what exactly do you need in what type of situation would you need an informal versus a formal dyslexia evaluation there are some pretty clear answers to this fortunately if you are simply wondering whether your child has dyslexia if you're curious about it if they seem to have trouble they've been having some reading writing spelling they seem sort of resistant about school period reading seems to be exhausting for them and if they show any of the the number of signs that we typically see what dyslexics then you probably then you might want to just have them evaluated to see if they have dyslexia and of course in this case informal evaluation is fine you simply want the knowledge about whether your child is dyslexic or not in this case informal evaluation works very well you can take them to a tutor or have them do an online tutoring session like we offer with dyslexia connect and the tutor will be able to tell you well they show these clear signs of dyslexia so in this case an informal evaluation is is a great way to go also if you think they might be dyslexic and you just want to find help for them an informal evaluation is enough for this because you're going to get an answer about whether they are dyslexic or not and once you know that they're dyslexic then you can go ahead and pursue dyslexia treatment options you don't have to have an official dyslexia evaluation to pursue dyslexia tutoring and dyslexia treatment options for your child now when do you need a formal dyslexia evaluation you need a formal dyslexia evaluation if you are going to use it in the school that your child is in typically any situation that involves a school state testing or any sort of situation where you're trying to get a 504 or an iep in place you're going to need an official evaluation because you need something that actually is official done by a doctor psychiatrist and will will hold up in the school system so if you're trying to establish an iep for them and you simply need to say hey here's the proof my child is dyslexic we need these accommodations for this reason because they are dyslexic you need an official official evaluation in this case it's going to be worth it worth it for you to do that also if your child needs special accommodations either in school or on state testing or a test like the the a ct or the sat you need an official evaluation because you're going to be able to take this official evaluation to the officials who are in charge of this and say here we have an official diagnosis of dyslexia we need accommodations for this reason so this is another case where an official evaluation is a is a great way to go so those are a couple of the the reasons or the different types of evaluations and dyslexia tests that are out there and depending on what you need you can decide on whether you would like an official evaluation or an unofficial evaluation as i mentioned an informal or unofficial evaluation is much less expensive it can be very cost effective and it can give you a solid answer about whether your child is dyslexic if you need an actual document that says your child's dyslexic an official one then you're looking at an official evaluation that's definitely what you need in that case so if you have any questions at all please feel free to post them here on our website wwlp. com if you're interested in informal dyslexia evaluation we actually offer that with the free session that we offer at dyslexic connect and you can feel free to go to our website and check that out and you can sign up on one of the contact forms there and if you have any other questions or comments please feel free to share them and i will do my best to to answer them answer your questions thanks a lot for watching and i'll see you next time bye bye you",

        "video_title": "Easy Homemade Foaming Hand Soap with Essential Oils",
        "video_sub_title": "hi my name is andria with andria crisp calm and today i'm going to share with you one of my favorite things to make at home that is super simple and easy and ends up giving me a lot of comments from guests so basically that's going to be foaming hand soap and it's really simple and i use doterra certified pure therapeutic grade essential oils which make it smell wonderful and makes it good for you and anytime anyone is visiting and uses our bathroom or washes their hands in our sink in the kitchen i always get comments about how great that soap smells and people want to know what's in that soap i love it and it doesn't matter i use different oils almost every time because i'm always experimenting with the scents and will always love it so how do you make it and why is it so easy we only need a few ingredients basically distilled water is the main ingredient and i highly recommend using distilled water instead of just regular sink water or even filtered water anytime you're making personal care products that call for water you want to use distilled water and distilled water is a hungry water and so it actually blends better with things because there's nothing in it except for h2o but also because there's nothing in it except for h2o you're going to have less of a chance of any type of contamination which is sometimes a problem when you're using or making things yourself at home because you don't have all the preservatives and chemicals that make the stuff in the store last on the shelf for eons so the other thing you're going to need to get is some type of liquid vegetable soap and dr. bronner's castile soap is the most common that people are familiar with there are different scents that you can get this one has peppermint it already and but you can get one that is actually completely unscented and then you can really experiment and use any in the oils when i blend this one because it has peppermint i make sure that i'm you doing other essential oils that go really well with peppermint this is another brand that i came across here locally and it has lemongrass in it already so i'm going to basically use that scent as a base and then blend in some other essential oils that also smell really good with lemongrass the final thing is you need your essential oils now i highly recommend doterra certified pure therapeutic grade essential oils but you definitely just want to make sure that you're using a high quality therapeutic grade essential oil and not using one of the cheaper brands that is probably going to have some kind of synthetic properties to it as well because essential oils are really around because of the perfume industry and the perfume industry is more in the smell they don't actually care about the quality and so because of that a lot of essential oils can be cut with synthetic chemicals and are not completely 100 % natural and pure and so you want to make sure you're looking for something that is a therapeutic grade and then the final thing that you need is you need the container and because this is a foaming hand soap and the base is really watered with just a little bit of soap you need to make sure that you have one of these containers that has the mechanism that makes the the soap phone and so you can see it's a much thicker mechanism it's not just a regular pump that's in this this is one that i purchased just in my health food store it was $ 1. 00 something i think and it's a small size they actually have a really large one that's kind of an industrial kitchen sized one and then this is actually an old dial soap container so i it had foaming hand soap dial hand soap years ago and i've just been reusing it on my own and then eventually decided oh wait i could put essential oils in this so that was the very first thing that i made the problem with either of these is that they're plastic and so i've been on the hunt for months and months to try and find something that was actually glass because i prefer any time i'm making my homemade products to store everything in glass because of trying to get away from chemical exposure and there are chemicals in plastic and essential oils can actually break down petrochemical based products that blank plastic so in walks this beautiful container that i finally found so just recently i found this container and i got it at bed bath & beyond and it's a glass container and as the sticker says i am foaming so when you go to bed bath & beyond or if you're on their website and you're looking you want to make sure that it's listed as the one that's a foaming soap container because there was a container that was very similar to those i think it was even made by the same company that was just a regular container that you could put lotion or soap in it didn't have that foaming action didn't have the mechanism built into it so you want to make sure that you're you're getting that when you're looking and then it's really simple you basically are going to just unscrew the lid and get out your distilled water and you want to make sure that when you're filling this up that you're not going to end up covering up up this mechanism so you want to leave a little bit of space and whatever container you're using but you end up putting in mostly water and then a little bit of soap and you don't have to measure but you end up putting in maybe a tablespoon maybe a couple tablespoons i'm almost done with the spout so i'm just going to get the rest of it out of there and use that up and then you can see when i put that in there still still some room for that mechanism there and then now this one has peppermint so it smells a little bit already but i am going to add some other smells to it so i've got my doterra rosemary and i'm going to put in just a couple of drops rosemary's pretty strong smelling so i just put in a few drops of that and then i'm also going to be putting in a few drops of basil as well and blending those smells all together and then you screw in the lid and then you just want to agitate it a little bit you don't want to really shake it because you can already see its foaming up in there a little bit already and then you just start to push and get out ah your foaming soap and that already smells pretty good got some on my nose um so i think i'm going to stop there sometimes the first time i pump the soap out and i smell it's not strong enough so you might need to put a few more drops in but i always start with less and then add more if i need to and you're done it's that simple now i'm going to go wash my hands in my nose thanks so much bye you",

        "video_title": "Headache - Overview (types, signs and symptoms, treatment)",
        "video_sub_title": "hello in this video we're going to look at headaches the main types of headaches and then treatment as well so headaches can be divided into two main types we have primary headaches and we have secondary headaches secondary headaches are pretty bad so is these are these are your red flag headaches and we'll talk about secondary headaches towards the end of this video but we will firstly look at primary headaches and primary headaches are your the main the most common types of headaches that is that are encountered by the general population so here i'm drawing this person with a headache and there are many types of primary headaches a very common type is one that affects one side of the face so unilateral and sort of upper half and these are young and this is known as the migraine headache then you have tension headache which is sort of feels like a tight tightness around your forehead you have the cluster headache which is sort of around your eye orbit area and then you have sinus headache which is related when you have sinusitis or irritation of your sinus and then you have hormonal headache which is a result of sort of a your home or hormonal levels changing so let's talk about each of these types of headaches in a bit more detail beginning with migraine so migraine is a disorder of recurrent attack so it comes and goes the location of migraine is mostly unilateral 70 % the characteristic of the headache it's gradual onset crescendo pattern which is basically increasing intensity sort of and and frequency with moderate to severe in intensity so the pain duration of the headache is between you know 4 to 72 hours roughly associated symptoms include nausea vomiting photophobia photophobia and also aura aura is sort of the feeling of something about to happen which is the intense headache then you have the tension headache no tension headache you can think of it as being more muscular so it's the most ubiquitous headache and is the most common reason why over - the - counter analgesics are actually bought so these are your the most common this is the most common headache essentially the location of tension headaches are usually bilateral and around the forehead area the characteristic it's pressure or tightness like a band which waxes and wanes the duration is variable and associated symptoms usually none then you have the cluster headache now cluster headaches are pretty painful cluster headaches are a group of idiopathic headaches that is associated also with trigeminal neuralgia now trigeminal what i mean by that is trigeminal is a nerve trigeminal nerve and it's a it's a very important cranial nerve that does as many things around your face essentially now the location of the cluster headaches is always unilateral and it's usually around the eye so it's one - sided around the eye the characteristic of a cluster headache the pain begins quickly it's deep continuous pain excruciating and explosive in a in quality the duration it's it's pretty quick in respect to the other headaches we talked about 30 to 3 hours and the associated symptoms are essentially the symptoms of the trigeminal nerve problem as well as some other nerve problems so just drawing it out here i'm drawing a face now we have to quickly just understand what the trigeminal nerve does in order to understand the symptoms associated with the cluster headache so the trigeminal nerve it has sense it's it's important for sensation around your face it senses an area around your forehead which is supplied by the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal then you have the maxillary branch of the trigeminal v2 which supplies sort of the nose area and then you have the mandibular branch which is v3 which supplies sort of the bottom area of your face so that's the sensations of the trigeminal nerve sort of is responsible for sensation around your face and these are its branches three branches so in cluster headache you have pain in this area in blue here around the eye and the associated symptoms include horner's horner's syndrome which you have ptosis and meiosis so ptosis is drooping of the eyelid and meiosis is a constriction so you're unable to dilate your pupils you can also have lacrimation and also nasal discharge so essentially what i'm trying to portray here is that the cluster headache you can have some associated symptoms involving the trigeminal nerve and sort of other nerve problems there in your neurology problems hope that made sense then you have sinus headaches which is associated with sinusitis you then you have hormonal headaches as well and hormonal headaches essentially it's when the changes of your hormone levels causes the headache so it can be associated with low eastridge in concentration for example at the beginning of the menstrual cycle or withdrawal withdrawal of hormone therapy so all of a sudden you have estrogen one minute and then you take away the hormonal therapy eastridge and levels drop you get this headache so those were the five types of headaches primary headaches migraine tension cluster sinus and hormonal now let us look at the drugs used the common or main drugs used to treat each of these headaches beginning with the migraine so for migraines which is recurrent um nsaids or aspirin plus antiemetics and hydration is important so antiemetics are drugs that in a stop vomiting for tension headaches simple analgesics so this is paracetamol and again it's the most common tension headache is the most common reason i guess why people one of the common reasons why people buy over - the - counter paracetamol for cluster headaches subcutaneous sumatriptan or oxygen can be given and this is to prevent vomiting in general trip tens which includes sumatriptan are actually contraindicated in certain patients in certain patient patients with cardio coronary artery disease peripheral vascular disease or cerebrovascular disease for sinus headaches supportive therapy is important and on g6 anti limit antiemetics and also you can prescribe but you can give antibiotics depending on the cause of the sinusitis so i hope you hope you'll just hope that may i hope that was clear the different types of primary headaches as well as just the general management now let's look at secondary headaches which as i mentioned earlier are our serious and dangerous secondary headaches are result of serious underlying diseases or other conditions so we have some warning signs and symptoms for secondary headaches and we can remember this by the acronym snoot sn o o p s stands for system exists symptoms illness or condition such as cancer n is for neurological symptoms or abnormal signs always for arm sent which is new age greater than 40 or it's sudden such as when you have a thunderclap sort of feeling which is a subarachnoid hemorrhage essentially the other o is for other associated conditions or features p is for previous headache history with headache progression or change in attack character so essentially what snoop is trying to say is that you know the headache that the person presents with is very abnormal and it's got all these signs and symptoms which will tell you hang on a second this is not normal there's a there's this is this is a more serious problem this is more serious than attention hey great headache or migraine so let's look at some examples so here i am drawing a person who has a very serious headache so examples of secondary headaches include intracranial hemorrhage and this can this can include subdural epidural or sub arachnoid hemorrhage and of course these these people they they can present with some some neurological problems as well as some you know some complaining of thunderclap essentially the onset was thunderclap then you can have another example is giant cell arteritis which also is known as temporal arteritis which is essentially the temporal artery with that is inflamed on the side of your head the final example of a secondary headache is in internal carotid dissection so in summary we looked at headaches which can be primary or secondary primary include migraine tension cluster sinus and hormonal and secondary are your dangerous ones and weak it's a it's it's it's it's a result of an underlying condition that is more serious and we can we can pick this up with the acronym snoop which helps us sort of identify if it's more serious or not and yeah so i hope you enjoyed this video thank you for watching wait",

        "video_title": "How to Diagnose Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in Adults?  - Dr Sanil Rege",
        "video_sub_title": "[ music ] hi welcome to another edition of hub bytes i'm sunil rege consultant psychiatrist from psycsene today i'll be taking you through the evaluation of adhd attention deficit hyperactivity disorder to set the scene i received a referral from a physician approximately three days ago it was a 42 year old female it was for an evaluation for adhd now one of the things we've got to think about is if i went ahead and basically carried out an adhd adult self - report scale or cadre questionnaire or diva 2. 0 and i identified attention concentration deficits hyperactivity and impulsivity i could basically say this is a this is adhd but the question is what if there are several other underlying things that might be contributing to these symptoms it's possible that could result in a misdiagnosis so that's really the aim of this video is to outline that the evaluation of adhd one adhd is a diagnosis of exclusion two we should think about adhd from a longitudinal perspective and to look at several other factors that might be contributing to these deficits and the reason why i think about it that way is because let's imagine this was a bridge and you as an individual crossing the bridge on a daily basis and if the individual has adhd they're doing that they've been prescribed a stimulant and they're going okay but what if there are several underlying factors that are making this bridge weaker that is there are vulnerabilities these factors act as vulnerabilities and at some point this bridge cracks and breaks that's when the patient comes to you and says doctor the medication isn't working they might present with depression they might present anxiety they might present with a range of other disorders so the really important aspect is to think about these vulnerabilities and address these vulnerabilities as well because every little thing counts and it's important that the cumulative effect of all these things that we've addressed results in a beneficial outcome and this is linked to the basis of psychiatric formulation and management i've covered this in another video on the channel so please please do have a listen to it as well we've also covered it in on the cycling hub. com as an article so really we're following the sherlock holmes way of thinking deductive reasoning and not succumbing to complementary bias so let's get started with the evaluation but as always before getting into the details it's important that this is not to be construed as medical advice any personal issues should always be discussed with your own doctor so the first thing i think about is the organic aspects what does that mean the medical aspects now this hierarchy has been covered in more detail on another video the psychological formulation management video on the channel so please do have a listen to that one as well so we in the organic section a few things that i think about firstly now this particular patient was diagnosed with moderate sleep apnea sleep apnea and sleep difficulties can impact significantly on cognition during the day so we know that adhd is can be considered really a disorder of cognition as well because it has attention concentration issues other cognitive issues as well that one identifies so sure cognition is a faculty right at the top that we think about but obstructive sleep apnea because of hypoxia during the night the individual can wake up really unrefreshed fatigue which impacts on concentration and attention during the day so obstructive sleep apnea is one of the factors to take into account the other aspects are vascular factors diabetes hypertension and we know that vascular factors can result in white matter hyperintensities of the brain and white matter hyperintensities are associated with cognitive deficits so it's important to be proactive in treating those as well now of course in some cases it is important to carry out an actual frontal lobe cognitive examination but other cognitive examinations such as a clock drawing test and if there are abnormalities identified going into more detail because in some rare cases it is not uncommon to identify a neurodegenerative condition that might present as adhd such as frontotemporal dementias because we know that frontal lobe is a predominant part of the brain that's involved in adhd so the point is it is important to carry out a thorough cognitive examination in individuals with adhd not just the adhd self - report scale of focusing on attention concentration hyperactivity and impulsivity then we also look at other aspects such as vitamin b12 folate deficiencies vitamin d deficiencies why do we look at that because we know that these are involved in the methylation pathway the first two and are necessary for the production of noradrenaline dopamine two key neurotransmitters that are involved in the neurobiology of adhd now this particular patient that was referred to me had elevated n a elevated dsdna the anti - ena was normal but their esr was elevated as well so that brings in the inflammatory hypothesis we know that when neuroinflammation is present or systemic inflammation is present individuals can present with significant cognitive disturbances and the other important aspect of inflammation is there is an overlap between fibromyalgia chronic fatigue syndrome and cognitive deficits as part of these particular syndromes so we know that the inflammation neural inflammation and systemic inflammation can result in fibromyalgia type syndromes chronic fatigue syndrome myalgic encephalomyelitis and we know that cognition is a core feature of these conditions so we often see this triad together so it's important to think about inflammation as well the other aspect to think about is thyroid functions and also iron because these deficiencies can present with significant cognitive issues as well in females and you know this 42 year old female i would also be thinking about polycystic ovarian syndrome why because estrogen and abnormalities in estrogen we know that estrogen is very very crucial for cognition so sometimes in the perimenopausal postmenopausal group we can see symptoms that are very very suggestive or can be diagnosed as adhd onset late but much of this can be due to estrogen deficiency for example impacting on cognition so it's crucial that the hormonal aspect is also evaluated so that's sort of the the organic evaluation then we think about substances and here we think about substance misuse so for example excessive alcohol use or cannabis use or other illicit substances and the reason why that's important is because these substances can impact on the subcortical area the basal ganglia and the connections to the frontal lobe the same pathways that can be involved in adhd you can have a more detailed read of the neurobiology of adhd which we covered in the cycling hub. com we've also covered the diagnosis and management of adhd with a focus on adult adhd do have a read of that one as well with substances we've also got to think about any medications that have been prescribed by physicians or psychiatrists because certain medications can impact on cognition the next aspect we think about is psychotic spectrum and when i think about psychotic spectrum it's not just about psychosis in the form of delusions and hallucinations but really we're thinking about the mesolimbic pathway and if the mesolimbic pathway is activated it results in hyperarousal symptoms heightened emotional reactivity racing thoughts and we know that these symptoms can impact impact on cognition so the functioning during the day but it can also impact on sleep resulting in middle insomnia early insomnia difficulty falling asleep or early morning awakening all of which can impact on cognitive functioning during the day and can look like adhd so it is important to address any mixed features but the other aspect that's important in psychotic spectrum is a thorough evaluation of ruling out psychotic disorders by taking a family history looking at the genetic aspects because individuals with prodromal psychosis can have neurodevelopmental abnormalities so developmental delay for example or attention concentration problems learning difficulty in school etc and much of this can one can fall in the trap of misdiagnosis they can be prescribed a stimulant and it can result in a psychotic episode so it's really really important to rule out underlying vulnerabilities towards psychosis to avoid misdiagnosis and a prescription of a stimulant that could result in detrimental sort of consequences the next one is the affective syndrome and here really once focusing on ruling out the severe forms of depression for example melancholic type depressions that have dopamine and noradrenaline as key underpinnings in the genesis so we're looking at you know dopamine not adrenaline sort of abnormalities melancholic depression because we know that in melancholic depression decision making attention concentration issues cognitive issues are a core feature of course adhd and depression can be co - morbid and both need to be treated and the reason why that can happen particularly in adulthood is that they might initially have adhd but because of difficulty coping through life it's resulted in lots of losses it's resulted in difficulty coping and it resulted in additional sort of depressive elements being added on top of the adhd so that's where the co - morbidity comes in moving lower down we think about trauma now with particular trauma we think about past trauma during childhood and why is this important because trauma impacts on the neurodevelopment the development of the brain and can result in not only cognitive issues but also impulse just regulation and impact on emotional dysregulation so trauma and looking at those aspects is important we know that trauma can also result in ongoing heightened sympathetic drive so therefore hyperarousal can be present so it's linked to mixed features as well but we know that trauma is also linked to fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome so we see this complex picture of trauma fibromyalgia chronic fatigue syndrome impacting on cognition but also many individuals with fibromyalgia chronic fatigue syndrome have mixed features so one's really got to think about deconstructing the problem and addressing each one rather than trying to search for a single diagnosis so trauma is really important but of course we look at current stresses as well because current stresses when added on to an underlying vulnerability can result in worsening of cognitive status next we look at ocd they can often be ocd comorbid i have seen cases of resistant ocd that actually were treated that had a diagnosis of adhd and responded very well well to stimulants why does that happen it happens because in ocd one of the neurotransmitters that's involved is dopamine so you can have a read of the neurobiology of ocd as well in detail in the cycling hub so in resistant cases one's got to think about the possibility of adhd and many individuals with adult adhd can have severe procrastination as a key feature the other aspect is anxiety now this is really crucial because we know that in childhood hyperactivity is a symptom but only 30 of individuals sort of move to have hyperactivity as a symptom in adulthood so a lot of the hyperactivity dissipates the external hyperactivity but sometimes the internal hyperactivity remains and this can present as internal agitation or internal anxiety so sometimes in resistant anxiety disorders it's worth thinking about the possibility of adhd but the other aspect with anxiety is that we know that sometimes when a stimulant is prescribed it can actually worsen anxiety so a thorough evaluation of the possibility of hyperarousal needs to be taken into account in adhd and hyperarousal is linked to as we saw mixed features but also anxiety so if there is significant hyperarousal then one can actually combine the stimulant to treat the cognitive elements of of sort of the frontal lobe aspects noradrenaline dopamine by using a stimulant but then treating the hyperarousal during other periods or the side effects by considering clonidine or guanfacine which is an alpha - 2 agonist but it's important of course any combination therapy should be a specialist treatment as far as possible we try to avoid combination therapies because we want to ensure that we prescribe one medication but again these are things that need to be discussed there are individualized treatments but just to outline that in some cases reduction of hyperarousal is absolutely crucial because there are two elements going on and i'll come to that in a sec when i talk about sleep uh of course it's important to think that individual eating disorder can also have adhd type symptomatology but of course then prescription of stimulants one's got to be very very cautious because they drop appetite we know that uh personality there may be certain personality traits that can sort of be associated with adhd but when there's lots going on here i'm not going to jump to the diagnosis of a personality disorder but high levels of perfectionism sort of anal casting personality obsessive compulsive personalities can sometimes of course add on that extra stress for an individual with adhd and one of the important things that i want to touch on is sleep a very very large proportion of individuals tend to have sleep disturbances individuals adhd have sleep disturbances we touched on obstructive sleep apnea which is important to address but circadian rhythm disturbance is very crucial as well you can have a listen to the neurobiology of sleep video that i did on this channel to really think about what is hyperarousal and what are circadian rhythms and how they impact on on sleep now when there is significant hype arousal at nighttime it can sort of present with vivid dreams difficulty falling asleep waking up several times in the middle of the night early morning awakening etc now this can impact significantly on cognition during the day because the individual wakes up unrefreshed and extended periods of hype arousal and sleep difficulties impact on cognition so there is good evidence that sleep disturbances impact on cognition therefore it becomes important in some cases simply addressing sleep by good sleep hygiene may actually improve cognitive function so that is one of the important things to take into account as part of management not just simply prescribing a stimulant because if there's ongoing sleep difficulties the stimulants might stop working and in many cases to address the um hyperarousal at nighttime circadian rhythm disturbances that's where clonadine and one facing may be utilized because they reduce that heightened sympathetic overdrive heightened nor adrenaline at night time and assist and sleep treat the vivid dreams of the nightmares and improve daytime functioning so in some cases a combination might be required where treating the hyperarousal at nighttime but and improving cognition during the demo be required but as i mentioned earlier that's really really individualized and you know sleep is important and of course diet is also important and of course in children and adolescents the link between dietary interventions and adhd is something that is considered um and it's something to take into account similarly in adults as well a healthy diet becomes very very important so the purpose of this interview is to highlight that it's important to carry out a thorough evaluation when presented with an adhd type picture the reason is because we want to ensure that these vulnerabilities are treated before jumping into the diagnosis of adhd so adhd is a diagnosis of exclusion it's important to run through the hierarchy a proper thorough deductive reasoning because when we rule out the impossible what must remain is as close to the truth as possible so i hope that you found this video useful if you've liked it please of course click the like button subscribe to the channel i look forward to seeing you in another edition of hub bites take care and stay [ music ] safe you",

        "video_sub_title": "[ music ] hi i m am chris harper and with me is makayla and we're here to demonstrate an application for ankle stability this could be used for any number of issues involving ankle pain. some causes may be ankle sprains, weakness, or instability. kt tape helps treat this condition by providing support and stability to the ankle. for this application we're going to place the ankle in a neutral or ninety - degree position. we going to take our first full strip and we're going to twist and tear the paperback backing of one end and removing that, this creates an anchor, but before we apply that anchor we need to measure where to place this. so we're going to place the torn end just on the inside of the heel going up under the heel then applying that anchor with absolutely no stretch. the next step is to remove the majority of the paper backing but leaving just a little bit on the end to hang onto as you want to avoid touching the adhesive part of the tape with your hands and we're going to lie that down to just the outside part of the ankle and then from there we're going to start applying a stretch at about fifty percent going up in under the heel and then laying that down. and then from here we're just going to lay the remainder of the tape with absolutely no stretch on it. great! give that a little bit of a rub, create some friction and heat and help adhesion to the skin and we're going to take our next full strip, and just like the first we're going to twist and tear the paper backing to create and anchor point and again like the first piece use the end that we did not tear to measure around the foot about point of the arch on the outside part of the foot and as that tapecomes around we're going to apply the anchor to the inside part of the foot give that a good rub and this anchor is going on with absolutely no stretch. we're going to begin by removing the paper backing leaving a little bit on the paper to hang on to. applying even pressure with your finger we're going to put a fifty percent stretch on this tape as we go around the heel and the outside part of the foot and then under the heel so just under the arch leaving that lasts a little bit to lay down with absolutely no stretch. ok, and now for our last fall strip of tape once again we're going to twist and tear that paper backing removing that piece to create an anchor point then just like that second piece we applied we're going to measure this by taking the end that we did not tear to about the midpoint of the foot. and then applying the anchor now on the outside part of the foot. this just helps us get the right measurement of the tape. from here we're going to peel the paper backing off leaving a little bit on the end, just enough to hang on to so we don't touch that adhesive part of the tape go around the heel with about fifty percent stretch than under the heel and then as we end the tape we're going to take remaining paper off and that last little bit we're going to lay down with absolutely no stretch on the tape. once again we're going to apply a good friction rub to create some heat and some good adhesion of that tape to the skin. we'll take a good look at that. that is a great ankle application. here are some tips before applying the tape clean skin very well to remove any skin or oils or lotions. you can wear a sock while sleeping so the tape doesn't roll with the sheets. and be careful with taking socks and shoes on and off. some complementary treatments include rest, icing after activity, anti - inflammatory medications such ibuprofen, and strength and balance training. please seek care if you have excessive swelling or pain, or experiencing any numbness or hyper flexibility at the ankle. for more information see our website at www. kttape. com",

        "video_title": "Tight Piriformis Syndrome Pinched Nerve Relief",
        "video_sub_title": "hey guys i'm doctors fast and also i'm gonna cover piriformis syndrome for you today and the reasons why it's just continuing in your case now the problem with piriformis syndrome is actually that a lot of times it's misdiagnosed and although the pain is in the area of the piriformis muscle and it really does feel like the piriformis is tight and achy and throbbing and so on and stretching it seems to reduce symptoms very quickly but it tends to come back the reason why these things tend to continue is because you're not figuring out who - what's driving the bus okay just like in the simpsons analogy you have maggie and marjan them in the open or driving okay if you don't stop the person who's actually turning the car that could the car is going to continue in the same direction so this is the same thing there's multiple things that can be creating a sensation of tightness in this piriformis and by the way if it tends to increase with bending forward or getting out of a car or putting shoes on we're sitting for a long period of time a lot of times the driver is not the muscle itself it's something higher now the areas that we're gonna be looking at here is if you see in the spine here there's a little red area which is a disc disc injury of some type in there varying different types but also there's this nerve passing by as well and as you can see if this nerve is being pressurized by a disc herniation or maybe even something like a narrowing of a little hole like stenosis sometimes those can be driving the condition and honestly if i'd estimate probably 75 percent of time easily these conditions of the tightness you feel is the reason why they continue is because you're not addressing the main driver of the condition now as i go through this exercise progression today i'm going to show you some of the some of the exams that we use here at the foreman's place to really figure out what's driving the bus and i really attempt to when i work with people on this i try to show them beyond beyond any any any doubt that their condition is not the muscle itself things that you can do which you won't do this exam is you can stress test a region you can really force this muscle into a lot in an elongated pattern and really put resistance on it and if it doesn't trigger response it's probably not it could you have scar tissue and adhesions and so on in there yeah probably maybe but a lot of times they're not symptomatic they're not paying generators so just to the piriformis overall just from a move standpoint it moves when the hip moves okay it's attached to the pelvis or the sacrum on the front side and it goes down and attach it to the hip so it will tend to move around when you move the hip forward and bring the hip bring the knee forward and also turn this way in that way at the hip as well so as you go this through this today the challenge that i give to you is to figure out what logically doesn't make sense with this if this is a muscle problem if it logically doesn't make sense then it's probably none muscle problem and a lot of times when you address this with a movement based correction and you offload that driver you'll be a - ok and this will be like you never even had it before let's go into that exam okay so one of the simplest things you can use to really rule out if this is a piriformis issue truly or not is figure out if your spine has a correlating factor with it now whatever the usually i take people through a movement assessment and i say like what what tends to bother your condition and they might say well you know one thing that really bothers it is they bend down like this one my piriformis really gets tight right all right i might say like hitting a golf ball my just going through the basic movement will make their piriformis feel tight so what we typically do is see if we if we can reverse that position of being rounded slightly and just see if that reduces the symptoms now i think we're all in agreeance at this position right here of being extended at the at the back or arching at the back is not a piriformis stretch and actually what i want is i want this area and below basically to be paralyzed and not helping that at all so i just have them hang in this position for about like 20 20 30 seconds sometimes people say well there's a little bit of tightness here in the back by the way if you have tightness in your back and correlated with a piriformis tightness it's probably not your piriformis it's the back is probably the driver now if they're sitting here long enough a lot of times people will start to melt and they'll get into a zero out of 10 pain and they'll start saying yeah it feels pretty darn good i wish i felt like this all the time if we challenge us range a little bit more and you go through small oscillations sometimes you'll find that again it starts to trigger a little bit it starts to become a little bit more irritated right along the back or in the piriformis the magix in the numbers here if you start finding that extension tends to improve it and they eventually get up to here and they're like yep zero out of ten pain and then you stand them up and you get them to go through the movement again and they're like hey that feels really good hey it doesn't hurt anymore that's a really simple way of figuring out if a disc injury is actually driving the driving the the condition with the piriformis and i'd say that's a strong majority of the time now to remedy this you really don't need to go through a bunch of manual therapy or tissue work or adjustments all the time they're they're needed in some cases but a lot of times it's as simple as doing something like this and getting them to stop picking their scab now people with piriformis syndrome again with self - diagnosed piriformis syndrome they'll do stuff like this they'll do their piriformis stretch when if you look at my spine here i'm rounding it okay and they're like yeah that's the stretch right so it's not a stretch they're feeling it's the muscle trying to protect this the disc from being torn apart basically in a slang term okay so anytime the spine rounds for them in this period of time in their life they're piriformis or their hamstring or their back is going to tighten up a little bit as a protective response now think about that it's a protective response all right it's trying to get you to not do it so when you keep doing it or you keep doing it it's gonna continue okay all we got to do is just treat this as as it as it is okay the pain is a self feeding fire so we just start throwing a bunch of sand on every once a while so a lot of times we find that you take people through this progression right if this is working all the time we give it to them frequently throughout the day and then we eventually build their program it with a little bit of core strengthening some hip strengthening and all of a sudden that stuff goes away and they're just have a normal life okay so if you have questions about piriformis syndrome think about the mechanics of it okay if extension the spine takes it away you're not stretching the pure piriformis if a piriformis stretch takes it away only for a couple minutes at a time no matter the piriformis stretch it takes it away for a couple it's a couple minutes or even hour at a time buddy yet it returns you have to consider if you're really doing the best thing long - term because i know this style works for people in office in addition if you understand the mechanics of your problem and if bending forward or sitting for a long time sitting for a long time or sitting in chair for a long time or driving or exiting a car if they tend to your symptoms what's the common denominator here right and if you put it like a little back brace there you start to go into extension or go on walks and it feels better again you're just reversing that rounded moment of the spine that you have so that's how we remedy a lot of stuff here performance plays for this type of thing if you have any questions in this video comments criticism just put a below i have no problem answering questions on this is a very good success rate on it dude huntington beach california come visit me it's when you start to build into a program like this later on it should start to look like a strength and conditioning program which is going to set you free and cut and do things on your own i will put a link to a little guide that i put together as well i'll put in the corner over here i get people to ask questions via email about these types of conditions and i and i'd love to answer as much i can however i want every understand i can't give direct responses so the easiest thing i can do is guide you through some of the youtube videos that i haven't counted they're really good at kind of laying down a foundation of what we would do in office to help these conditions if you guys learned something from that by all means okay so they're on the site check them out if you don't like them let me know how to improve them talk to you guys next time [ music ] you",

        "video_title": "How to join up Quilt as you Go blocks and borders - Quilting Tips & Techniques 074",
        "video_sub_title": "hello today i'd like to show you how to put together the quilt as you go blocks so i've been showing you how you can do some quilters you go with strips some quilters you go with appliques how to prepare your borders and finally we're going to get to put some of it together so i've started putting together some here so we're actually using some strips of fabric for our joining so we've got it this is the front side obviously and this is what we're going to see is a colored strip on that side and then on the back side we're going to see also a colored strip now it could be the same fabric or it can be different fabrics as you can see i've used different fabrics here so we cut our blocks or i cut my blocks to nine and a half inches and that's the size they're going to stay they don't get taken in with seams or anything like that and then i've cut my strips i'm using this really cute little stripe for the strip on the back and then i've got this blue for the front now i have cut the back strips one inch wide and the same length as the size of the block so they're one inch wide by nine and a half inches long i think it's a really good idea to cut them to the right length before you sew them so that things can't sort of travel and move when you've got the batting and everything in the fabric things can kind of move and you might find that they get a little bit short or tight or long or something and the front strip is actually a two inch wide strip but i've pressed it in half so that the raw edges meet and that also i've cut to length so i'll show you now how we join them so on the back i'm going to lay right sides together my strip level with the raw edges of the block and i'm going to flip that over and then i'm going to lay the blue strip on the right side also with the raw edges level now you may find you want to pop a couple of pins in there as we know i'm not really a pin person but i'll use pins today and this is partly so that we can make sure things are feeding evenly if you've got a walking foot a walking foot's a really good idea because we're going through so many thicknesses including a batting which makes it quite spongy what the walking foot does is it feeds from the top as well as the underneath so you get this more even feed going on so i'm going to go to the sewing machine now i'm just going to sew a quarter inch seam allowance and away from that edge as as you would normally do just your quarter inch all the way down on there so i'm all set from a quarter inch and i'll just sew it all the way down taking those pins out as i go now i'm going to be doing this joining up entirely by machine if you're wanting to do some hand sewing and slip stitch it down you need to do all this in reverse but we'll just go with the machine at the moment so i've got that on there now i've got my quarter inch seam allowance and i've got my strip there and my folded strip on the front so now we need to make and this is a little bit tight this next part but we need to sew this strip to the back of this piece now so that's got to go right sides together so that on the back you'll have that strip joining it so again if you feel that you'd like to pop some pins in and this is going to be a little bit fiddly because this the bulk of this seam that you've just sewn kind of wants to get in the way but you've got to just tell it where it belongs and keep on sewing and trying to keep your quarter inch seam allowance even if you can because our fabrics are all cut to the same length everything should fit nicely so now we're just going to go and can you see what i've done there i've got my strip pinned in between there so if i lay it down i've just got a tight little area here but but your sewing machine should fit in there fine you're just doing the quarter inch seam allowance along there so you can just hold this other seam out of the way a little bit as you go so just take it slowly don't need to rush remember you've already quilted your quilt you're nearly done so a walking foot's a good idea as you can see this kind of all wants to move around a little bit just keep an eye on it keep rearranging it if you need to to make sure that it all stays in place i'd much rather take my time over this and have it right unpick it i don't pick very often okay now that can come out of there and it should be all sorted so this what will happen now if you've got your quarter inch seam allowance right is those little areas that are in the seam allowance should now just sit together quite comfortably they shouldn't be overlapping there shouldn't be any gaps they should just sit together so that when we fold this over which we're going to do and cover that it's not over a great fat ridge or anything it's just a little bit of a ridge because it's an extra piece of fabric and on the back we should have a nice half inch wide strip because we started with one inch we've taken quarter of an inch off each side and that's looking pretty good so now what we're going to do is make sure that's all sitting nice and flat and we're just going to flip this folded bit over a little bit like you do a binding so this is where i was saying if you were wanting to hand stitch that down you could either do that on the front or you would put this part on the back and you would have that strip on the front i'm going to machine mine down now because it's this wide it will come just past a seam allowance there so on the back you will actually see if you look hard a little tiny line of sewing just next to your colored strip if you've matched your threads to the back you're really not going to notice that in the end and it doesn't worry me to have that little line of sewing there if it bothers you you might be better to do it the other way around and hand sew this down but i would never get mine finished if i was hand sewing so again if you want to pop some pins in and just to hold that in place but i'm just going to stitch now on the front very close to that folded edge of my blue fabric and i have got a matching blue thread in the top but i've left my neutral on the back so i will actually see my back stitching but it's not wearing me so that's it so there we are all nicely joined up and nicely joined up on the back so that's all ready to do the next strip and join that together but i've actually already done the next little bit so i can show you how it's all going to go together so i've already joined up these two rows of blocks because i was only having nine blocks and i've pre - cut like i had pre - cut the lengths to go between the blocks when i've joined the row i've also pre - cut that to the length when we measured for the borders we found that the three nine and a half inch square blocks measured 28 and a half inches long so i knew that i could cut my strips that long so on the back i've got all that little colored stripe going on there which is quite fun so i've joined my rows and i've joined the border on that side so i can now go ahead and join that row on there and i've already got my strips cut here so i cut them the 28 and a half inches and that will be because nothing's changed size all we've done is is put those um seams together and add those strips over the top just to cover the seam so that you can see that that is actually the right length at 28. 5 inches so nothing has changed which is really good you can kind of be all organized with this quilt um and then i've got my other border to go on that side there now in the corners because of the way i'm doing the borders i wanted some little colored squares so i've already joined those on the end i had quilted some little squares and they're going in the corners so they're already on there now so i'll do i can do this whole bit through i can join up these rows put the two borders on the sides and then i can do the long strip down here and i've already pre - cut my strips to go along there it was my 28 and a half inches plus my five inches each end for the border so that's 10 inches so that was a 38 and a half inches so they're already pre - cut which is great so there's my quilt just about done and everything else when i joined the little squares on the border i put it on exactly the same way as i've joined all these together so that's how it's going to go together it's not hard to do just take your time and you'll find it's a really nice neat little way of making a quilt and with borders as well if you want to a lot of people don't put the borders on they just bind the blocks but i thought it would be quite nice to have borders as well and i think if you've chosen your fabrics nicely for the back you can have a really nice looking back on your quilt as well and how fun is that to have a reversible quilt so hopefully that helps you put together your quilt as you go applique or piece work and some borders if you want to pretty much anything you feel like doing so that's about it for quilt as you go thank you",

        "video_title": "5 Best Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Stretches & Exercises - Ask Doctor Jo",
        "video_sub_title": "hey everybody its doctor jo and the pups, and today we're gonna show you the top five stretches and exercises for carpal tunnel syndrome. so let's get started. the first stretches are just more of a warm - up. so just make a fist with both hands. most the time it's usually in both hands. if it's not it's still pretty good to do both. and once you make a fist you can keep your elbows bent. if you want to put them straight out you can, but this is more of a warm - up, so i usually keep them bent. and just bend them down as far as you comfortably can and then up as far as you comfortably can. so almost like you're revving a motorcycle up, but just to kind of a continuing to stretch back and forth. so this is a little bit more just getting it as a warm - up instead of a full stretch, but you'll feel that stretch in there, so i would say maybe ten each way. but just going up and down just kind of getting those wrist moving a little bit. especially if you've got that carpal tunnel syndrome in there where that that numbness is coming down into your hands and you feel it and your fingers and in your hands, that's a good way to kind of warm it up. then you're going to turn your hands up this way where your thumbs are on top, and then you're going to go into radial and ulnar deviation. so just up and down. so same thing, this is really just to kind of get that wrist loosened up. it's kind of a continuous motion going up and down. you don't have to go super fast. you don't have to go super slow. just kind of a continuous motion just to get everything nice and loosened up in there. and again that you know that carpal tunnel is right here, so that median nerve that comes down through there is the one that usually gets compressed and giving that nerve pain. so if you're having nerve pain up here and even up into your neck, that's not carpal tunnel syndrome, that's something coming from your neck or your shoulder. if it's higher up sometimes it radiates a little bit this way, but it's not going to radiate all the way up into your shoulder if it's just carpal tunnel syndrome. so then the next ones are going into a full stretch. so this is going to be for your wrist flexors and your wrist extensors. so the first one, this time you're going to put your arms straight out. you can do kind of a modified version and then you can do it a little bit more. so you're going to kind of come up into a stop sign position like this. this is the bigger stretch here. if you don't want quite as much of a stretch you can start off with your fist straight out, but if you want a little bit more of a stretch under here for those wrist flexors then put your hands up into that stop sign position. if you need even more of a stretch you can put a little bit of over pressure with the other hand. and alternate back and forth, or you can go up against a wall and put a stretch in there, but this one's a full stretch. so you want to hold that stretch for thirty seconds, and you want to do that three times. what i like to do is alternate back and forth between your wrist flexors and your wrist extensors, so instead of doing all three at one time, now you're going to come down, but it's gonna change. so if your fingers are straight out you're just gonna have a little bit of a stretch on those extensors up there, but if you want more of a stretch curl them in and you'll really feel that stretch through there. and then if you still need more of a stretch you can either push on each side, or take your hands and kind of push them up against the wall and just get some more pressure in there. so again thirty seconds, three this way. so if you just alternate back and forth there'd be a total of six times, three each way for that thirty seconds. so that really gets it nice and loosened up. then the next one is going to be a prayer stretch. that really stretches into that carpal tunnel area, so what i like to do is put my palms together. to start off with with my elbows kind of close together and then keeping your palms together, bring your elbows out and your hands down. so it kind of looks like you're going into a prayer. but you really want to push those elbows out and you're going to get a really really good stretch in there. now this going all the way down. if you have carpal tunnel syndrome this might be just a little bit too much. so bring it up a little bit if you need to. thats stretching, you want it to be tension. you want to be that good hurt, hurt so good feeling, but you don't want to just be pain pain. you might get some of that numbness tingling feeling in your fingers when you're doing this. you're putting that compression on that nerve, so as long as if you let it up it goes away that's fine, but if you're stretching and you feel it and you let it up and it's still getting that numbness, some tingling, you might be to doing a little bit too much. but this is another one where you're holding it for that 30 seconds and then you're doing that three times. so really just getting that good stretch. if you need to take a break in between and shake them out and again, if it's a little numb, but then it kind of goes away if you move it a little bit that's fine, but if it stays numb that's when you probably really need to check in with a doctor or physical therapist because it might be something else. it might be coming from your neck, your shoulder, your elbow, or your wrist. so that's why it's really important to find out exactly what's causing it first. so the next one is going to be for your pecs to stretch out those because even though this is the carpal tunnel syndrome, that whole chain goes all the way down. so sometimes those tight pec muscles in there do cause that numbness and tingling. so if you're not quite 100 % sure, doing a pec stretch is really good stretching out that chest area. and an easy one to do while you're sitting down is just take your hands and clasp them behind you. and so basically what you're gonna do is you're gonna push down and out and then just push your chest forward as you stretch. and you should really feel that stretch right through there. so again if you feel a little bit of numbness and tingling while you're doing it, it's okay as long as once you let go that numbness and tingling goes away, but if it continues after you hold that stretch, don't keep doing it because that might be something else going on that you really need to get checked out. so pushing down and out and then pushing your chest out and for it and again holding that for 30 seconds doing that three times. so then another good one to stretch is your anterior scalene muscles in the front and again if these are tight a lot of times it will pull up in this area and put pressure on the nerves going out this way. so sometimes it's like a thoracic outlet syndrome pushing on the brachial plexus something like that where you're having that numbness and tingling in your hands that you might think it's carpal tunnel syndrome, but it might not be. so another great stretch to do is to stretch out those anterior scalene muscles. so what i like to do is just kind of place my hand on my collarbone here, that just helps kind of hold it down to get a little stretch, and turn your head the opposite way. so if i'm stretching this side and then bring that ear up towards the ceiling. so i'm stretching right through that area right there, and i get a nice good stretch. i feel it again it should be super comfortable, not painful. holding that for 30 seconds. and then i would actually do each side even if again you're only really feeling it on one side, i'd stretch out both sides just to get everything nice and loosen up. so again 30 seconds, three times on each side. holding the collarbone or that clavicle turning away and then looking up pointing that ear towards the ceiling. so there you have it those were your top five stretches and exercises for carpal tunnel syndrome. if you'd like to help support my channel, find out how by clicking up here, and don't forget to subscribe by clicking down here. and remember, be

        "video_title": "3 diet tips to increase AMH | Nourish with Melanie #69",
        "video_sub_title": "it is possible to increase amh levels with the right diet. in today's episode of nourish, i'm going to give you 3 nutrition tips to increase amh levels.... and if this is your first time joining us, i have a special freebie for you. i'll tell you how you can access it at the end of the video. stay tuned! amh, or anti - mullerian hormone is a hormone made by the small follicles in your ovary which have not yet begun to develop into mature eggs. consequently, a low amh reading indicates that you probably have a reduced egg count. less eggs may mean that it's harder to conceive, although, it's important to remember that you only need one healthy egg to get pregnant! it's also important to note that if you have pcos, also known as poly cystic ovarian syndrome, you may, but not always, have higher than normal egg count and amh levels. however, the following strategies still seem to be beneficial for most women with pcos. ok, strategy numero uno, and the strategy with the most evidence behind it to date, is to make sure that you're getting enough vitamin d. studies pretty consistently seem to show that women with low vitamin d levels tend to have lower amh levels than women with healthy vitamin d levels. it seems that vitamin d plays a key role in egg survival and growth. some foods, like salmon and eggs, contain a small amount of vitamin d, but most of our vitamin d comes from the sun. on average we need 10 minutes of direct sunlight or 30 minutes outdoors on a cloudy day to meet our vitamin d requirements, so find a way to get outdoors each day, and if you haven't done so in a few years, it might be a good idea to get your vitamin d levels checked by your doctor. tip number 2 is that if you are overweight, losing weight can help. now i know that this is easier said than done, but do the best you can.... particularly if you're about to undergo an expensive ivf cycle. however, it's also important to note that it's important to lose weight in a healthy way. studies seem to indicate that even when women have significant weight loss, if they don't have a nutritious diet, it doesn't necessarily increase their egg count or amh levels, in comparison to when they lose weight and still meet all of their nutrition requirements. ok, strategy number three is to make sure you are doing regular exercise. although this strategy only seems to be helpful for women who are overweight or who have pcos. so, the next question is how much exercise do you actually need to do to see a result? well, there's not enough research to answer that question definitively, but i will tell you this : one study got women to do a 45 minute walk three times per week for 12 weeks, and saw some great results! so, maybe start there? and, maybe think about doing your exercise outside so you can get some vitamin d at the same time ( although this study was done indoors ). now, i promised you a special freebie. i have a free fertility meal plan for you to download. all you need to do is go to www. melaniemcgrice. com / fertility. and, if you'd like more tips about how to increase your egg count, make sure you check out my other videos, and click subscribe as i have some more tips coming up on this topic soon. i look forward to seeing you in my next video!",

        "video_sub_title": "hey guys what's up welcome back to my channel so today i'm going to be showing you how to make diy tinted lip balm so what you're going to need are some eyeshadows so here i have some pink ones that i'm going to use and you can also use blush so i have a red one and a pink one and you're also going to need some vaseline so i have white petroleum jelly here and you need some containers to put the lip balm in you also need a bigger container to melt the vaseline in and you're going to need a spoon in a nice and you also need a microwave so without further ado let's get started the first you're going to scoop out the amount of vaseline that will fit into your container so my containers are pretty small so i'm going to do just about one spoonful so this is how much vastly and i put in for one container then you're going to choose the color of eyeshadow or blush so i think i'm gonna go with this color so if you want more of a pigmented lip gloss then you would put in a lot more eyeshadow and if you want a more sheer lip gloss then you would put in less so what i'm going to do i think is putting the whole eyeshadow because it's not very big so let's go for it so you're going to scrape it out with your knife that's it i put all the eyeshadow inside it's what you're gonna do next is put this container in the microwave until it melts and then you're going to stir it so that all of the vaseline and eyeshadow have mixed together once it's melted completely like this and flick wit then you can pour it into your container once you pop it in the container you're going to close it up and leave it to harden for a few hours you can even put it in the fridge for it to harden even faster so that's what i'm going to do so i'm going to let this sit for a few hours and i'm going to try one of the blush so we'll see how rad this can be let's try putting in the blush first we're putting the vaseline and make sure that the blush or eyeshadow is broken down as small as it can be into a fine powder so that there's not these big chunks so now that the blush is broken up into a powder i'm going to add some vaseline i'm gonna add a little bit less than last time because it wasn't so pigmented so we're going to and maybe one spoonful instead of two i'm going to add about this much so i'm going to microwave it and i will be right back so it has completely melted i'm going to pour it in now it turned very dark but i think that it will lighten up as it hardens so this one's done i'm going to let it harden and we'll see how it turns out so i'm going to make a few more and when i come back i will show you them a few hours later when they have hardened and how they turned out and also do some swatches so stay tuned for that so these are the three lip glosses that i made so the first one is very light i'm going to do a swatch so this is it it has absolutely zero pigment so that was a fail i think that i put too much vaseline and not enough eyes shadow and the second one is red it turned out very well it's dark and it looks really really nice i'm happy with how this one turned out so i used a whole blush for this one so it's very pigmented man the last one i made was this pink one there it is in there it's a really nice pink color it's also pigmented and it worked so these two are thumbs up and this one is a fail but it'll still work as a good lip balm so that is how you make your own diy tinted lip balm with only ingredients so if you want me to do more diys give this video a thumbs up and let me know in the comments down below what kind of diys you want me to do that's about it for this video so if you enjoyed it give it a thumbs up subscribe leave a comment down below and until next time bye",

        "video_title": "TMJ Treatment for Tension Headaches | Chesterfield Chiropractor",
        "video_sub_title": "[ music ] hey guys how's it going this is dr. chris collier at elite high ranking performance i want to kind of continue with our theme of the month on tension headaches and today we're going to go over what i think is the biggest cause of routine tension headaches and that's what we call temporomandibular dysfunction or tmd for short i'll point this out and get this a lot where patients come in they say they have tmj which we all do that's just the name of the joint so the temporal mandibular joint or tmj for short we have them on both sides so the tnd or the dysfunction of that is basically when we do things that increase tension in the jaw or the neck things like clenching or grinding or other things like what we wear turn pair of functional habits so binding of nails chewing on pens playing with hair just things we do with our hands on our face that aren't really necessary that can lead to more attention so like i said tmd i find this is the biggest reason for attention headaches and it's actually a very very common reason for neck pain in general so you may not have any pain in your jaw you may not even have headaches but you you can't have tmv which is contributing to neck pain so usually when someone comes in with neck pain and / or headaches we're always looking at the jaw to make sure things are functioning properly so we're gonna go over just a quick little treatment session that i would do for somebody as far as tmj stuff is concerned and then maybe dive into what people can do on their maybe in this video or in other videos we'll see how it shakes out so i have sara here so we treated sara you know on and off for a while and initially part of the complaint was we're unrelenting or i guess that's a tough word but a persistent tension headache so we did find some issues with the the john itself and so what i do when i initially evaluate somebody with this is i first have them laying with their head and neutral here and then i'll look at them as they open and close the job so first thing let's go ahead and just open as far as you can and so and then close and then so if you kind of look in through here as she opens it's a little bit of the jaw swinging to the right and then as she closes it kind of recur x and fixates itself that can happen for a lot of reasons one of them being tightness of certain muscles on certain sides of the job they kind of pull you in different plays like that another reason that can happen is that the joint itself is really tight so first i start noting okay what do they do with opening and closing and then one other thing is i get her head in neutral go ahead and open as far as you can as far as you can you'll start to see her extend her neck so basically super common but as we open our jaws as far as we can we're recruiting all of our stuff like several muscles in our neck so that's where you definitely start seeing the play of neck pain and headaches kind of colliding together so after i do that i'll come in i'll start to palpate the joint itself and go ahead and open and close so i'm looking for a couple things i'm trying to feel is there any popping or clicking so if you do feel that in your jaw that's the disc that's in the tmj it's not staying where it should and so we're looking for popping or clicking i'm also trying to feel an opening close i'm trying to feel if one side moves too much or not enough and so with sarah i kind of feel i feel like the left side moves too much so my fingers are under here and as she opens i feel the bone just gonna really jump out at me so it's not the point of this this video here but sometimes people's jaw is dysfunctional not because it's super tight but it's too mobile and we have to do different strategies to fix that and let's do this one more time and then if anything maybe the right side just a little bit stuck one common test that i do or i have a patient do is called the three knuckle tests so we take three knuckles we stack them vertically like this and we open our jaws as far as they can and we try to insert it in there try that so she's kind of sometimes she easily can do it sometimes it's a little limited i'm going to relax there i'll find if you have any tmj issues and you can do that it's probably because you're one of the people that open too much you're cheating to get that kind of range of motion typically though if we can't quite open to that amount that can be because of tightness and all the muscles that contribute today so it's akin to you know a very general sense of i can't bend down touch my toes because my hamstrings are tight i can't open my jaw as far as i can because certain muscles like this guy the masseter and your temporalis muscles are there so these guys in addition to some of the neck muscles will refer pain to different areas so if you have pain over the eye and a candy - cane fashion a lot of these are in play across the forehead across the back so don't always assume things are tension or i'm sorry don't always assume things are sinus related i get that a lot i think a lot of our headaches or tension bass so now that we have an understanding of what we got going on here i start to work in various types of treatment so my favorite thing to do for tmj dysfunction is what we call post isometric relaxation or pir for short and that's diffusing the neurology that helps stretch the job in to improve reigns of range of motion the reason why i love it so much because i can teach you how to do it on your own and that's the beauty about a lot of tmj stuff is that you can self treat yourself with almost the same epic to see is when we're and when we're doing a bite in here so i this is where i you know the patient starts feel freaked out i got the rubber glove on you know they're like what's gonna happen so basically i stabilized the forehead and i for the most part it's just my thumb on the inside of the mouth and then we're doing just sets and reps of contracting and relaxing okay so it's been a while since we've done this era but you know the drill here so stabilize here we're gonna open as far as you can good i take thumb through here and all i do is i take her to the first barrier that i'll feel and you already feel a stretch with this yeah so i kind of hang out here we do a lot of breathing work in the office as well especially if you have headaches and so i just tell them to focus on relaxing their body and relaxing their midsection so that they can breathe with their diaphragm so now once i get to a good point i'll have her very lightly close her jaw and i'm resisting that movement so now i'm activating the muscles of the jaw for about five seconds and then go ahead relax after five then i take it a little further and then we hold so we're just reaching new barriers as we go how's it feel being on camera like a fishhook in your mouth it's so sometimes the patient they don't even know it but they're really trying to close their mouth because it's an unknown or unnatural feeling of having is stretched but the more we do it the better it does so go ahead and let's let's close a little bit and then relax so i take it a little further typically this doesn't hurt it can be intense depending on the person i know when i have it done it's intense but i have an issue of clenching some just they really like it because it feels good the only pain that comes out of this is my right thumb digging into their teeth that's it and so if you feel sorry for me i appreciate that so we usually want to make good changes not just in how they feel but how much they can move and open their jaw and we look for about it depends but like five to seven millimeter changes which i'm not really measuring these with a rule or anything but we just kind of look at the motion and we you know take it from there good so we'll take a break there so i might go back and do another round of that maybe i do more within the one round other things i can do so i mention the right side felt a little bit more restricted so i come in here spin open i just slide my thumb in and basically i'm just giving it a little bit of traction and i'm oscillating it's just mobilizing the tmj is not a joint that i thrust on or i like adjust in a typical sense i just mobilize and relax your jaw and so i'm just kind of pulling it apart sometimes i'll do this little earthquake type motion and i'm just trying to budget into a different direction here good and relaxed other thing i mentioned or i didn't mention when i'm watching it open go ahead and open so she doesn't have it but commonly as people open and they push the jaw out and so if that's the case what i do for that is i do the same thing as the opening and closing but i start to work i'm pushing it straight back so i'm just gonna lightly do it here open a little bit relax and then i push it down and then after a little bit and i'm gonna have her push her chin in and then relax so we just go back and forth with that there's other things i can do with muscles in the mouth but it's all just about pressure and movement there's no quick thrusting or you know forceful stuff with this we want to be careful with that other stuff that i'll do is i'll come on to the muscles and cells so muscles you're gonna really find a lot of issues with our here which is your masseter which is your big clenching muscle and then through here you're temporalis and so these muscles are known to have trigger points at various areas and so what i do a lot with this is more pin and stretch so i kind of pin and hold it go and open the jaws far as you can and then relax and open so obviously you can easily do this on your own by using your own hands i drag away and then i open as far as i can same thing through here and close so it's adding an inch stretch you can also just do basic trigger point work through here like this so work around good so that's you know it one type of treatment for tmj now if you have headaches you ohso have this looked at i find that it's overwhelmingly common and if you don't have headaches if you just have neck pain or you're tense you have stiffness absolutely gotta look at this and this is where we take people that have headaches almost every day of their lives and wearily they have no headaches and it's changes our lives and i feel like we don't have to live with headaches and for some for a lot of people when they come in here they're not coming here specifically for headaches they're mentioning other problems and we're just looking at it like are you sure you don't have a headache issue and then they finally realize i think i do it's just normal i live with it and so the big goal of this is we not only can improve neck pain and headaches with this but the quality of life the tension that's released from that your head it's on blue and it's an easy thing for you to do on your own to kind of pick it up with maintenance type of deal so a little bit there so i did a little bit the job there's other stuff i can do for it but for her this is what i like to do and then

        "video_sub_title": "this informational presentation is about hair regeneration. are you of someone you know is suffering from hair loss or thinning hair? did you know that men can start losing their hair as their early as their teen years? and that it's been estimated that 30 % of women suffer from hair loss under the age of 50 and that percentage rises up to 50 % over the age of 50. for men, traditional medical therapy has included minoxidil and finasteride. for women, the medical treatment has been limited to minoxidil. although medical therapy has helped many people, there has been a need for more options to help people suffering from thinning hair. the search for a cure for hair loss has challenged physicians and research scientists for decades. in this presentation, you will learn about the pioneering application of a remarkable wound healing technology to help people suffering from hair loss. this presentation is for informational purposes and is not a substitute for proper medical examination. dr. amiya prasad, a highly respected cosmetic and reconstructive surgeon, has worked for several years developing a medical treatment for thinning hair using a material called extracellular matrix. as a multispecialty surgeon, dr. amiya prasad has applied extracellular matrix technology to surgical procedures for eyes, ears, facelifts, reconstructive surgery, body procedures and hair transplant surgery. focused in helping men and women with thinning hair, dr. prasad developed his own combination of extracellular matrix, platelet - rich plasma, vitamin d and other materials to help people with thinning hair. how does it work? in the past few years, advancement in wound healing technology such extracellular matrix or ecm has helped surgeons like dr. prasad help patients with complex problems. when this material was used in hair transplant surgery, it was observed that thinning hair actually became thicker. dr. prasad combined his surgical knowledge using ecm with the latest research from top universities such as the university of pennsylvania, yale university and the university of tokyo to create his own formulation and delivery methods to help men and women with thinning hair. based on recent scientific studies, the cells and signals between the cells that produce the hair, stop working resulting in hair thinning and eventually hair loss. the clinical evidence indicates that this advanced wound healing technology combined with dr. prasad's techniques restarts the cells and necessary signals to restore the hair growth cycle. dr. prasad has helped people who have come from all over the world. dr. prasad : the work i've done has helped people think differently about hair thinning. for decade after decade, the hair transplant industry seems committed to sell surgical procedures and not managing patients. these so - called hair transplant specialists focus on patients to come back for more surgery knowing that the patients would continue to lose hair and need more procedures to keep up with their appearance. we now have an opportunity to change the conversation about hair thinning and apply hair regeneration as a way to restore your hair without surgery. this doesn't mean that hair transplantation is obsolete but a significant percentage of people with thinning hair can benefit from hair regeneration. so what is the treatment? first, you will meet our staff and have detailed medical examination including medical photography and microscopic examination. your treatment options and suggested plan will be explained and discussed thoroughly. once it has been determined that you are a suitable candidate, the clinical team will begin the process. you will have a simple blood draw like you would have a routine laboratory test. as your platelet - rich plasma is being prepared and mixed with the extracellular matrix and other materials customized for you, a topical anesthetic cream is applied to your scalp. the area to be treated is made numb and then you have your treatment. most clients go back to work and normal activities the next day. after your treatment, you will receive instructions. the staff, including your doctor, is always available to you 24 hours a day. you will be scheduled for follow - up examinations but you will be welcomed to come back as often as you like if you have any concerns. to learn if hair regeneration can help you, contact the offices at ( 212 ) 265 - 8877 24 hours a day or visit www. nyhairloss. com and complete a contact form.",

        "video_title": "How to Relieve a Headache/ Migraine without Medication",
        "video_sub_title": "hi i'm jackie van rowland in today's video i'm gonna show you how to relieve a headache without medications so whenever i work on the face i'd like to start working on the chest first and so in this video i'm going to use this tool here this is a muak a jasper and it's wonderful for just opening up the chest and the neck and getting all the passageways for excessive fluid to open and drain as well as to relieve that tension and especially if we're having a lot of headaches it's usually because we have a lot of tension in this area and that can leave a load energy stuck in our heads and so let's relieve some of that tension it can help to bring some of that energy down and then i'll show you some specifics point points and zones that you can work on your face to further decrease that headache even prevent getting headaches from the future so what happens with headaches again is that you just have a so much tension and it just keeps this energy stuck in your head or you may be on your computer a lot you may be on your devices and your eyes are just like becoming overly tense and just just from looking at the screen all the time and so doing this is just gonna help to relieve that tension between your eyes and then bring some of that energy downwards into your body and one thing you can really do is to really focus on getting some relaxation or doing things to help to decrease that tension so things like really quick exercise like a high - intensity quick bursts of exercise are really good anything that just helps you get like a little bit of aggression a little bit of tension out would be really good for people who get headaches on a regular basis headaches tend to be really common in people who have a lot of wood element and the wood element is all about people who like to do things are just like constantly doing constantly going they don't like to relax they really don't like to stop you know they're constantly learning new things doing new things trying to accomplish a goal trying to accomplish a mission and so sometimes they just forget that they actually do need to let their body have time to decompress and each end relax in order to be healthy so i'm gonna start with this tool here and i'm going to use a serrated edge there and we'll work underneath the clavicle and this is just starting to open up those lymph drainage passageways so that's so important as if we have a lot of tension here if we're on our computer all the time and our shoulders are like this or next like this and there's no way for that length to move and you're just in this constant state of tension so i'm doing this without any oils at this point because my goal is to release adhesions between the fashio and what happens is that when you're in the same position for a long time your fashion is like yeah i'm just gonna help you stay in this position and so it forms these little adhesions ideally you want your fashion moving against each other really freely but anytime that you're staying in the same position for a long time it'll just start to form adhesions and that's just helping your body kind of stay in that position but it's not really not what you want same thing happens with wrinkles if you're making the same expression over and over again your body's just like cool we're just gonna hold your face in that expression because you're doing it so often and we want you to have less work to do to get it into that position if that makes sense so we're just relieving those adhesions now i'm gonna move over the clavicle and i'm using this kind of a pointed edge on this tool and again i'm always supporting the skin here because we're getting that little tiny stretch on the skin and so you would think that that's stretch would cause wrinkles but really happens is that it prevents wrinkles and i'm gonna take the scooped edge here and work all the way around front of the neck again i'm holding the skin here i'm getting a little bit of a pull or a little bit of a stretch there put my hair between my ears cuz it's trying to get in the way i'll whip behind the neck and if you really are a wood element person you're probably early i don't have time for that i don't have time for this we're just doing these little extra self - care movements during the day are really going to help to release some of that tension and that stress that you're carrying around you'll actually be better able to get more done more effectively there just do that same thing on the other side little bit of a stretch there as i'm pulling on the skin you're not pulling hard you don't want to stretch it too much which is why i'm moving my hand to support it with each move they're coming up here no idea you want to do work on your neck like just a tiny bit each day that's really gonna help to relieve that tension help open up those passageways for a length to drain it's gonna keep you looking younger longer which is the best part of it let me use that scooped edge to get in the front of my neck you want a more complete neck routine i have a free video showing you the number one thing you need to be doing to age gracefully and that is working the neck because then that plays the most important role and how quickly you age if your neck is tense and stressed all the time you're just gonna age more quickly and if you're able to release some of that tension and that stress you'll find that you look younger longer right so that's all the neck movements i'm gonna do today you can always do more cuz it's always just gonna be super helpful i just want to open up those passageways for lymph to move and for your body to relax and decompress and then i'm going to move into doing some of the facial reflexology points so before i do that i like to just use a couple drops of a facial serum facial oil so if you have one that you like just using a tiny tiny bit cuz i don't want a lot of glide on my skin so i want just a little bit so that i can feel feel the um stressful points in my face they're really just enough to just provide a tiny bit of a slip but not too much you can move that down let your napkin your chest if you like to let's next i'm i get out my detector and it's a couple different areas we're gonna work so there's a few heads zones and this covers like the whole head and so you may find specific points in there that feel a little more spicy or a little more tender than others and there's a head zone right here in the center of your kind of between your brows and your forehead and there's other head zones right here in your temples so we're gonna start with those i'm just going to take the detector and i'm just gonna massage around in this point and i'm looking for points that feel more tender or zingy or you're just like oh that feels really good might even be that hurts oh good feeling and while you're doing this just take a deep breath i'm feeling a spot right here so i'm gonna just massage that for like 10 or 15 seconds if you find a really thing you spot you can even just hold it if that felt feels good you don't want to hold any spot for longer than about 15 to 20 seconds just because it'll actually won't make anything worse but it can actually help it to go away and then come back that tenderness if that makes sense so then i'm gonna move into this area and find any other spots that feel tender or zingy or stuck if you get headaches a lot you can do this prophylactically so you could do this you know every morning before you get going or at night before you go to bed and this can help to just slow down or reduce the number of headaches that you have you know i had a client that was getting headaches a couple times a week like migraine type things and she started doing this on a daily basis and i saw her about a month later and she's like i've only had two migraines the whole month where she was getting them like two to three times a week before that and she's like they weren't nearly as bad as they were before and so this is something that you can just do prophylactically the less you take medications probably the less that you'll end up having the headaches because they can actually decrease your pain tolerance especially if you're on like ibuprofen tylenol a lot all of those things so those are two zones for your head so here and here and then i'm going to show you a couple other points that you can work to help to decrease tension and the pressure in your head so the first point we're gonna do actually gonna do the liver gallbladder points because let's have a lot to do with where you send energy in your body they're gonna be on the right - hand side of your face correctly in line at the bottom of your nose and then directly under the like the iris of your eye and a little bit to your right you can just work on those points again you're relaxing your breathing you're really feeling what you feel in your body and then the other two points it's going to be one on either end of your upper chin's if you go right where the chin and they're gonna go to the side this is the point that releases tension so called a muscle relaxant point so it helps to relax all the muscles of your body but in particular the muscles in your neck wrists and ankles and then you're gonna go down just a little bit further and this is the point that helps to release tension in the head this is great for headaches and also for insomnia you find that you can't get asleep at night because you just have too much going on too much going on in your head and then the other side there alternatively you could just massage the whole chin area with some special emphasis on those points and then lastly i'm going to show you two points that are specifically for the eyes so if you're finding that you're getting an ocular headaches or you're getting headaches because you're on your devices some like you're on your computer so much you just have some extra eye attention those points are gonna be halfway between your inner brow and your hairline on both sides so it's gonna be about right here and i'm feeling some good tension in there so i'm gonna massage this a little bit longer it feels really good so again you can do like you know 10 to 15 20 seconds i'm gonna do the other side and what you can do usually if you're working this formula your headaches not going to go away 100 % the first time you do this but you may notice a drastic reduction and in your headache so what you're going to do is we want to decrease the pressure decrease the tension decrease the pain and then kind of let your body do the rest of it for you and then if the tension or the pressure starts getting a little bit more then just do it again the other eye point is going to be right where the top of the ear attaches to the face you can just do some good motions right in there and then i like to finish it off just by going up and down the ear this helps to open up that lymphatic drainage passageway it helps to set the formula into your body so that your body is using it better and using it more effectively and i like to end by going downwards and that helps it energy downwards and your body will do the other side so working right where that ear attaches to the face and then do those up and down motions beside the ear and by going downwards alright so i hope that helps you with any headaches that you're getting again if you're somebody who just gets headaches on a regular basis or you know you find that you're getting them a lot more now that you're on the computer more or you know talking to friends on zoom'or whatever it is that you're doing that's giving you more screen time do this prophylactically has to do it before you get the headache and you may find that when you get a headache that they're less intense or that you're just getting less in general so be sure to let me know what you experienced and i will see you soon",

        "video_title": "ADHD in Girls: How to Recognize the Symptoms",
        "video_sub_title": "hello brains! isa aka superbrain asked if i could do a video focusing on adhd and girls. of course i can isa. in fact, lets play a game. find the kid with adhd. [ music playing ] [ glass breaks ] [ intro music ] this one's a no brainer right? well, you know what i mean. but did you notice the girl brain staring out the window? how about the one still working on her test long after everyone else is finished? if you didn't, you're not alone. boys are diagnosed with adhd three to four times as often as girls are even though research is starting to show that girls are just as likely to have it. in fact, some experts believe that boys are being over diagnosed while girls tend to be under diagnosed. why is that? the simple answer? it's complicated i did a ton of research on the issue and i found five main reasons for this. one : stereotypes. boys tend to have the hyperactivity form of adhd which is what we tend to think of when we think of adhd. since most research, literature, pop culture, focuses primarily on how adhd expresses itself in males most people are more familiar with what adhd looks like in males. the less girls fit in to that stereotype, the less likely it is that they'll be recognized and diagnosed. two : the squeaky wheel gets the grease. boys with adhd tend to cause more trouble. so parents and teachers are more likely to look for a solution. girls tend to have the inattentive form of adhd. on progress reports, they're the well behaved bright students that just need to try harder. even the girls who are hyperactive tend to try to work harder to be good and fit in than their male counterparts do probably due to societal pressure. three : clinical bias even if a girl does stand out enough to be referred to a mental health professional she's less likely to be diagnosed with adhd than a boy is. even if she has the exact same symptoms. four : girls are more mature. actually, girls just mature faster then boys do. there is a definite correlation between maturity and likelihood of diagnosis. studies have shown that children young for their grade level are more likely to be recognized and diagnosed. since girls tend to mature faster then boys they're more likely to be missed. five : adhd comes with friends. and not the good kind. 40 % of those with adhd also have a learning disability, such as dyslexia. and 75 - 80 % of kids with adhd will develop a second or even third psychiatric condition at some point in their lives. which makes things really messy and hard to diagnose, even for experts. that's true for both genders. but girls are three times more likely than boys are to be treated for depression before they are ever diagnosed with adhd. so despite what pop culture would have us believe adhd is not a one size fits all stereotype that's easy to spot. so as teachers, coaches, parents, friends how do we know what to look for? well, it helps to understand what adhd usually looks like in girls and how that differs from what it looks like in boys. before i get started a ) i'm not a doctor, you probably know that by now, and b ) these are generalizations, not every boy or girl will behave this way, but they tend to. boys get in trouble a lot, at school and work. girls tend to have more difficulty in social relationships and at home. boys are usually more physically aggressive, shoving, hitting, kicking. girls are usually more verbally aggressive. boys'symptoms are more external. girls'symptoms are more internal. boys often interrupt while other people are talking. girls space out while other people are talking. what were you saying? five minutes ago? aaaaaaah! boys externalize their frustrations. girls tend to turn pain and anger inward. boys are more likely to have behavioral issues. girls are more likely to suffer from low self - esteem, anxiety, and depression. remember, these are genralizations. this is not going to be true for everybody, and there's going to be exceptions. in fact, boys with the inattentive form of adhd also tend to get overlooked. and even boys with hyperactivity can easily be dismissed as just boys being boys. in both boys and girls, it's important to recognize and treat adhd as soon as possible. early treatment can not only help manage symptoms now but help prevent other disorders from developing in the future. i've posted some great additional resources in the description below. please share this video with teachers, coaches, parents, anyone that you think might be in a position to recognize and help a kid who is still struggling. that's it for this week. thanks isa for your great topic suggestion. if any of you would like to suggest a topic, hit me up on facebook or twitter or comment below and be sure to subscribe so you will see it when i make it. bye brains! also, remember girls don't only have the inattentive type. they can also have the combined type or the hyperactivity type. the hyperactive type tend to be tomboys. the combined type, they tend to talk a lot.

        "video_sub_title": "( bright music ) - i'm a runner, i'm a distance runner, marathon runner. i'm a real active person. i went through stevens - johnson syndrome - stevens - johnson syndrome, otherwise known as sjs is a very rare condition in which one's body attacks its own mucus membranes such as the skin, including the skin around the eyelids and the outer surface of the eye and cornea. - at that time i was taking an antibiotic and i had the worst possible reaction to it. it caused massive blistering over my body. my tear ducts, i would say don't function. i had incredible limitations and i couldn't look up, if it was light i couldn't. i had to be inside. - it was really affecting his whole quality of life. - my doctor here at usc brought dr. chiu to my attention and thank goodness. - jeremy was referred to my clinic by an ophthalmologist and he complained of light sensitivity, burning pain in his eyes, constant scratchy sensations, related to the misdirection of his eyelashes that were constantly stabbing his corneas. he couldn't work. he owns his own business and he had trouble seeing what he was doing. jeremy was referred for prose treatment. so prose stands for prosthetic replacement of the ocular surface ecosystem. and the treatment involves the customization of small rigid scleral prosthetic devices that fit over the entire eye. a non - preserved sterile saline sits within the chamber of the device, over the entire eye. and this is what helps to relieve the pain that patients have. the liquid bandage essentially protects the cornea and allows the surface of the epithelium to heal if it's aggravated and you can also put a prescription into the device itself. so with these customized devices patients see better, feel better and the health of the cornea can be improved. - when i put these prose contacts in, it was a game changer. i don't even know how, now that i've had them for several years i don't know how i got along before. post prose, it was as close to getting me back as i had seen yet. - [ gloria ] the usc roski eye institute is one of two locations on the west coast that offer prose treatment and one of 12 in the nation that offer this service. - it really wasn't until i met dr. chiu that not only that i find that she was so clear on my condition, but also she made it so that it wasn't fear going in for another appointment. she was someone who i felt really cared about that i get, that we'd find something for me. - jeremy, he's come a long way since i first started treating him several years ago. when he came in, he couldn't open his eyes, he was constantly wearing sunglasses, he had hats on to block the sunlight from his eyes. he is now able to wear his prose devices on a daily basis and he can see better with them. he doesn't have the pain that he suffered from before. and the surface of his eyes, the corneas themselves look much healthier. - a manner is amazing. - we'll be lifetime friends and i'll be seeing him for a long time to make sure he continues to do well.

        "video_sub_title": "cirrhosis is a chronic condition meaning it can last a long time there is no cure for cirrhosis and we want your liver to work as well as it can so every day you need to make choices to protect your liver we want you to have a good quality of life besides taking your medications and avoiding ordinary pain relievers like ibuprofen how you eat is very important in helping your liver work as well as it can a healthy liver breaks down foods into many usable parts it makes fuel for your body from carbohydrates and fat it makes proteins for building muscles and healing and it stores and activates vitamins and minerals the liver also breaks down waste products your body makes when the liver is stressed or scarred from cirrhosis it has to work harder to do these jobs making changes to your diet can really help your liver and the rest of your body work better there are three main nutrition things to do for good liver health when you have cirrhosis the first one is to follow a low - salt or low sodium diet that's no more than 2, 000 milligrams of sodium per day this will help your liver work much better please view our low sodium diet video for details on how to follow this type of diet it's an important part of the diet for cirrhosis the second thing to do for good liver health is to eat enough proteins throughout the day eating enough protein throughout the day helps your body clear waste products and helps with clearer thinking and less confusion small frequent sources of protein can help your body handle these waste products more easily to get enough protein in your diet you can eat animal sources of protein such as milk eggs fresh cooked meat and seafood you can also get protein from vegetable sources like unsalted nuts seeds and soy products these may be easier for your body to process you may also use protein powders that are low in sodium to help get in enough protein skim milk powder is especially a good source of protein and it can be added to foods like mashed potatoes and puddings the third point is that you may need to limit the amount of fluids you drink or take in during the day eating less salt will make it easier to drink less fluids since you'll be less thirsty limiting fluids includes common fluids like water juice milk coffee and tea as well as foods that are liquid at room temperature like ice cream popsicles and jello soups can also be a major source of fluid they are high in sodium usually so it might be best to avoid those altogether ask your medical team if you need to limit your fluids remember by limiting sodium you'll be less thirsty and this really helps to limit your fluids finally let's review a few general eating points to follow for cirrhosis eat smaller meals more frequently throughout the day turn three larger meals into six small meals spaced every two to four hours throughout the day this is especially important if you have a fluid in your abdomen and find it hard to eat enough food at one time be careful not to overeat at breakfast so that you're able to eat a few hours later separate your liquids from your meals by about 30 minutes this can help increase the amount of food that you can eat at your meal or snack sip on high - calorie beverages between meals such as liquid oral supplements this helps get in more calories and protein if you have to limit fluids you may not be able to do this as much though always have a bedtime snack with protein and carbohydrate for example peanut butter and jelly sandwich would be a great snack or milk and graham crackers for more information including low sodium diet menus foolis for a low sodium diet and how to season food without salt check out our patient education handouts on this topic",

        "video_sub_title": "finally it's time for the orange video i'm going to show you how you peel this orange the usual way to peel an orange is to sort of dig your finger in and peel off bits of peel you know you end up with this pile of orange peel takes forever and then you have this ball of orange that you want to eat but you can't put it down anywhere because it'll get dirty so this method that i'm about to show you will take care of all these problems it's quick and it's clean and you will have little plates to put your little orange wedges on so the first thing you want to do is look on both ends of the orange this end has a bunch of lines on it that's what you want because these lines tell you where the space in between the wedges are and what you want to do our goal here is to split this orange in half so you want to split it right in between the wedges you're gonna sort of use your thumb nail a little bit you can use a knife too but the whole point of this is so that there isn't a knife you just kind of score it a little bit right so that you break the skin all right along the line and then once you've broken it enough that you can kind of stick your thumbs in there then you just dig in your thumbs a little bit and you pull apart and this orange is really thick so you kind of need a help along there so now you have two halves of an orange and you could stop here and you can start digging out the wedges and eating it but i like to go a step further so you'll notice that the part you want to eat is in here and this this peel actually makes a really good pleat so if you're out you know camping or just you don't have a plate or some clean surface handy the peels like a very good container what you can do now is you can kind of see where the wedges are inside if you want you can sort of peel away a little bit of the excess you can kind of see where the the wedges are and what i'm going to do is i'm going to take these halves split them both in half so you end up with quarters so what i'm gonna do is i'm kind of like same thing you break the skin like you kind of make a tear in it we're the wedges and then you just pull it apart like that boom i've got quarters now so i'm gonna do the same with the other half now what you can do is you can separate the wedges from the peel like just by doing this kind of getting your thumb working your thumb in there and then just pulling pulling out the wedges like that now i have wedges and peel split these wedges apart one at a time now put them in a peel so boom now i have three little wedges and they're all sitting inside this peel and this peel is just gonna sit on my table and there you go all right cool so your orange is peeled you've got little wedges there sitting on little orange peel plates little bowls and yeah you don't wait the best part about this is once you're done eating this is all you have left so that's how you peel an orange all right hope you enjoyed watching this if you want to see more of this subscribe below i don't know what i'll do next maybe i'll teach you how to like peel bananas i think you already know how to do that but i'll show you anyway all right see you next time bye so juicy okay",

        "video_title": "How to Use Your Insulin Pen",
        "video_sub_title": "> > hi, i'm dr. emily walker, a va pharmacist, and i would like to discuss with you the proper way to give yourself insulin using an insulin pen. there are many different types of insulin pens available from the va. in this video, i will be demonstrating one specific type of insulin pen called the \" flexpen. \" other names of insulin pens prescribed by your provider may include flextouch, solostar, or kwikpen. what is important for you to know is that the correct technique that i will show you in this video is very similar to what you would use for any of the other insulin pens mentioned. remember, what insulin to use, how much to give, and when to give yourself the insulin will be told to you by your va provider. let's get started. when you're preparing to give yourself insulin, you want to make sure that you place all the proper supplies on a flat surface ready to go. these supplies include your insulin flexpen, or whatever insulin pen you may be using, your pen needles, an alcohol swab, and a sharps container. if you don't have a sharps container, you can use a heavy plastic container such as an old laundry detergent bottle and write \" used needles \" on the side with a permanent marker. before injecting yourself, wash your hands with soap and water. when your hands are dry, pull off the pen cap from the insulin pen and set it aside. next, inspect the insulin through the viewing window. don't use the insulin if you notice a change in color or if you notice things floating in the insulin. by inspecting the insulin pen, you will also be double checking that you have the correct type of insulin. as i mentioned already, for our example today, i'm using the novolog flexpen which has been prefilled with insulin aspart. after inspecting the insulin pen, put it down and open an alcohol swab. wipe the rubber stopper on the end of the insulin pen with the swab. allow the rubber stopper to air dry completely. don't blow on the rubber stopper to dry it as this will introduce germs from your mouth. next, pick up the pen needle and remove the protective paper covering. grasp the base of the pen needle and carefully screw the pen needle on to the insulin pen. make sure the pen needle is screwed on straight and hand - tightened so that it pierces the rubber stopper completely. make sure you don't over - tighten the pen needle as the pen needle base is plastic and can crack. next, pull off the clear plastic outer needle cap. you will see a second inner needle cap still covering the needle. remove the inner plastic needle cap. both plastic caps can be disposed of in your regular household trash. it is important to always use a new pen needle for each injection to reduce the risk of infection. never reuse or share needles with your family or friends. next, you will complete an air shot with the insulin pen which should be done before each injection. an air shot is sometimes called \" priming. \" doing so removes any air that is trapped in the needle. turn the dial up to two units. hold your insulin pen with the pen needle pointing straight up and lightly tap the insulin pen with your finger a few times to make sure any air bubbles move to the top. next, press the push button all the way in. the dial should return to zero. you should see a drop of insulin appear at the tip of the pen needle. if the drop does not appear, repeat the process. this can be repeated up to six times. if it still does not work, try using a new pen needle. if that doesn't work, then try a new insulin pen. next, select your insulin dose. check to make sure the dial is set to zero, then turn the dial selector to the desired number of units. the pointer arrow should line up with your desired dose. the dose can be corrected up or down by turning the dial. for example, if you were prescribed insulin aspart 10 units before meals, you will dial up to 10 in the pen window while making sure the arrow lines up with the desired number of units. be careful not to press the push button while selecting your dose or the insulin will come out prematurely. you will hear a click for each unit you dial. it is not recommended that you attempt to dose based on how many clicks you hear as this may result in an incorrect dose. please note, towards the end of the insulin pen use, you will not be able to dial more than the number of units remaining in the insulin pen. next, if your skin is not clean, use an alcohol swab to clean the site before injection. if you've just bathed, you may not need to clean the area with alcohol. remember, alcohol can be very drying to your skin, so you don't want to apply alcohol to your skin if not needed. insulin can be injected into either your abdomen or stomach area, buttocks, on the high hip upper outer area, thigh, or upper arm. that is the back fattier part of your upper arm and not the muscle area. the needle you are using is thin and may bend. you may find that pinching your skin gently before injection can prevent bruising and decrease the chance of bending the needle. it is recommended that you rotate to different sites each time you use the insulin pen. if you plan to be physically active right after the injection, it is recommended to rotate around your stomach area only rather than to the arms, legs, or buttocks. avoid injecting insulin into any area of skin that has pits, is thickened, or has lumps. avoid injecting where the skin is tender, bruised, scaly, or hard. in addition, stay one to two inches away from your belly button, scars, or skin with open wounds. if you are injecting more than one type of insulin, use different injection sites as the insulins won't work as intended if injected in the same site together. for instance, give your basal or long - acting insulin on the left side of your stomach and then give your bolus or rapid - acting insulin on the right side of your stomach. insert the insulin pen into your skin straight in and not angled. again, if there is not enough fatty tissue, pinch a one to two - inch portion of skin in fat. once the insulin pen needle is inserted into your skin, keep it in place and press the push button on the insulin pen all the way in and maintain it pressed until the arrow next to the dial returns to zero. keep it pressed for a full six seconds after the dial is at zero to make sure all the insulin is injected. now you can remove the insulin pen. a small drop of insulin may appear at the end of the needle. this is normal and can be expected. if a drop of blood appears on your skin after you remove the insulin pen, press the injection site lightly with a gauze pad. don't rub the area. once the injection is completed, don't recap the needle as this can cause an accidental needle stick injury. remove the pen needle from the insulin pen by grasping the sides of the plastic hub and twisting. discard the pen needle into the sharps container. place the pen cap back on and store the insulin pen in a safe location. your insulin pen can be stored at room temperature below 86 degrees fahrenheit for up to 28 days away from heat or light. it is recommended that you keep your unused insulin pens in the refrigerator between 36 to 46 degrees fahrenheit as the insulin pens can be safely stored until the expiration date on the label. never freeze insulin. when the insulin pen has been completely used up, it will not allow you to give any additional doses. at that time, you can discard your insulin pen with the pen needle removed into your household trash. the pen needles should always be placed into a sharps container. you have successfully given yourself a dose of insulin using an insulin pen. good job. i thank you for your service to our country and i'm honored to be of service to you this day.",

especially this area right here on the outside excuse me the inside part of the knee this right here where it attaches to the inside part and that can cause a lot of inner thigh pain as well the gracilis muscle which is this band of muscle right here that can also cause inner thigh pain and then you have the pectineus and the adductor longus right here and the pectineus that can cause kind sometimes even growing pain and inner thigh pain as well now on this side this is you see this triangular band of tissue right here this triangular band of muscle these are the adductors i'm not going to go into all of them but these also contribute to a lot of the tightness and knots that go on an inner part of the thigh that's what we're finding on a lot of these folks and here's some of the abductors that have been cut away to look at the bigger one here that adductor magnus well pain discomfort messed up nests in the inner thigh so how do we fix that well there are two exercises that you can do at home to help fix this you can first of all and get your handy dandy lacrosse ball yeah so this is a very unique style inc in the description where to get one of these but very inexpensive very portable which is awesome we like using a little frost ball because it has like a rubber it's a solid rubber and it holds on to because it's made out of the outside part is rubber it's it's sticky it holds on to the surfaces a little bit better and what you do okay let me do it this way like this tilt this down a little bit so you can kind of see right here alright so we usually invite folks to start from distal to proximal so start toward the knee the inside part of the knee i'm in a little bit of external rotation here alright external rotation and i'm gonna search right here for some tightness like right there there's some tightness right there in the inside part of my knee right there that vastus medialis kind of where that sort aureus is and the gracilis and i'm just gonna oscillate back and forth on those tight areas just like that once i find it i'll work my way up see there's another spot and there's some tightness right there and then oscillate back and forth find these areas and work three to five minutes on these tight areas and you may you may have to work a lot if this whole band is super tight if you find a sensitive spot like right here this is a sensitive spot for me so three or five minutes in this sensitive spot and then you move and you find another one this may take you a while to get through this especially we've got a lot of issues in the inside part of your knee and you've never really taken care of it so here i am i found a spot right here i'm gonna work three to five minutes on this spot again i'm working distal to proximal so i'm push pull let go push pull let go push pull let go and i'm worked out for you five minutes then i go up into the abductors and say let's had some issues right in here and actually i have some issues right and through here this these abductors up in here toward toward the groin and again you're gonna hunt around find the spot search around for that spot there you go there's a spot right there i can do cross friction in through there or i can just do longitudinal so i can kind of go start distal to proximal push pull push pull push pull three to five minutes to loosen those suckers up and you can even up you find when you find a spot you can even oscillate just kind of back and forth if you will on that spot using lacrosse ball if you're lazy like me i'm kind of lazy so i get the good old handy - dandy barbell you can use a standard barbell this is just a 25 pound pound barbell and i'm gonna lay count on my side and external rotation like this and again i'm starting from distal to proximal tear and i can right there there's the spot right there on my basses medialis kind of like rats that sartorius gracilis area and i can oscillate back and forth on that tight spot on the inner part of my thigh right there oh that's good now i'm just kind of i'm just using the weight of the barbell here to do the work for me i can hang out here i can be watching a game or whatever it may be on the floor and i'm just good yeah i'm working my way up just like this and again if i find a spot work three to five minutes on that spot move up search around for a different spot three to five minutes and through there and you're working your way all the way up toward the the inner part the top part of your inner thigh toward the groin and right there there's a spot for me right there and again i'm working three to five minutes in that spot oscillate back and forth using the barbell so this is a great tool to use you can use a standard barbell this is just of the olympic 25 pound olympic barbell it's a smaller one obviously the olympic standard one which is 45 pounds this is a 25 pound one we prima just use this one for light curls and tricep explore arms tricep extensions that type of thing but it's perfect for stuff like this at home it's a it's a great tool to do some self massage self myofascial release in through the inner thighs so that's the first thing you need to do you need to clear out the junk in your inner thigh clear out those knots doing some self massage using lacrosse ball or a barbell the second step is - now that you uh not'add these areas you want to stretch them out you want to open them up so one of the greatest hip openers that i'm assuming you probably aren't doing because i don't see a lot of people doing it is wall abductions hip abduction so what you do let me lift this up just a little bit so you can see what i'm doing what you do is you come up to wall like this and you put your butt up against the wall like this so now my foot is up against the wall and i'm right in here and i'm ab ducting a deduction remember because these are the abductors in here they this is adduction this is hip abduction is from here to here and then a b duction is from here to here and so we want to open this up since we've loosened up the knots in here we want to open up hips by going into a bee duction and man i'm just at this end range right here and just letting gravity do the work for me like i said i'm kind of lazy so this is a fantastic hip opener that hits that opens up the adductors here the inner part of the thigh opens it up and you can hang out here 3 to 5 minutes 3 to 5 minutes now don't sit here in agony for 3 to 5 minutes if you have to in a minute or so if you have to take a break relax a little bit and go back into it and that's fine too but work let gravity just open this up and be lazy and let gravity do the work for you and this opens up the entire inner thigh opens up the adductor magnus stretches those out the gracilis sartorius you don't really get a whole lot of stretch of the vastus medialis but this we find that the abductors are usually an often neglected muscle group that's causing a lot of the inner thigh pain sometimes drawing pain and even the inner knee pain medial excuse me medial knee pain that people are experiencing so here you are just like this 3 to 5 minutes for you 5 minutes when you find a spot or if you're mobilizing 3 to 5 minutes on each spot work from distal to proximal and man you'll find that that inner thigh pain will soon be a thing of the past so you have any questions with this video drop it off in the comments section below we thank you for watching we appreciate it if you're new here hit subscribe and when you hit subscribe make sure you hit that bell notification button because that will keep you in the loop with subsequent videos coming here in the near future and that way you can continue and move well live well also i know you know folks who are battling inner thigh pain medial knee pain groin pain share this with them since you know sharing is caring and it's hard to see family members and loved ones friends that are experiencing this type of this type of issue so share this with them sharing is caring also give us a thumbs up give us a like it lets us know you care anyway we thank you for watching we appreciate it we'll see you next time take care bye bye [ music ] [ applause ] [ music ] [ applause ] [ music ] you",

        "video_sub_title": "hi guys craig beals from beal science i was at the salvage yard the other day and i found this an unused satellite dish now of course a satellite dish normally takes in rays from a satellite and turns it into a tv signal for your television but i'm wondering if i can do something else with this a warning if i can use it to harness the energy from the sun if i can take the sun's rays turn this into a parabolic mirror and have it actually cook things and burn things all we really have to worry about at this point is whether or not the sun's gonna shine so let's build this thing first thing we got to do is get this paint off the outside and get it a little bit shiny and polished up now i had to get some mirror coating and i looked at a lot of options and found that this is the very best one this is from green power science i'm gonna put the link to their website in the description because they have the very best stuff now i cut it into strips just so that it wouldn't bubble up and make a mess and i wanted this nice concave surface so then carefully carefully get this stuff laid on there without any bubbles make it as nice and smooth as possible which takes a little bit of time but it's well worth the effort you get this smoothed out and then take up all the other strips and spread them out so that they overlap this is gonna make it much more reflective than it is with just that polished surface now i figure the first thing we better try is a marshmallow because it's summertime and summertime is the season of s'mores and this marshmallow is starting to get high i didn't know if it really work i mean i guess why wouldn't it work you know it's a parabolic mirror but sometimes when you make things you never know and lay there in no time my marshmallow started on fire this is this is perfect i think it's time to really start roasting some marshmallows see what we can do with this home a parabolic mirror well it started on fire i get rotated here got our first gross tea toasted marshmallow kids you want try it is actually quite good all your favorite marshmallows be good yeah just try to melt some chocolate it's melting on chocolate i couldn't believe we were reaching temperatures of 340 degrees with this thing talk about a perfect and cheap solar cooker i mean speaking of cooking the marshmallows were just turning in a char well how does this work hey all it is taking the sun's rays and then it's just refocusing them into one point that's a very little surface area that's generating a lot of heat from the sun it's amazing finishing touches on the s'more oh yeah well we confirmed the power of the sun and we've made ourselves a s'more using that energy that infrared energy coming all the way from out there i think it's time to try this out see how we did goal here get you excited about sciences that video is all around me but the main goal is to keep on learning make us more this summer thank you enjoy not good",

        "video_sub_title": "[ music ] hey it's juanita mcdowell from emotion real estate institute giving you a tech tip that was inspired by students who emailed me i need to create a to - do list can i use google to do that the answer is yes you can in fact it's one of the easiest and best ways to create your to - do list let me show you how to do that you're gonna go to google calendar i understand the question because quite often people come here and think it's just a calendar view because if they do go to task and they click this drop - down box they can see it the only thing they can do is colorize their task so what you really want to do to start creating tasks now watch what's gonna happen in my right side of my screen if you want to click in the box and now when you do that you can see your task list right over here on the right side so it's a very easy operation two ways to create a task let me give you those two ways you can actually pick a day let's say the twenty first clicking that day now instead of the event click on tack and i'll just say read look one and then i can put some notes in there and create the task as you can see that's pretty clean and easy another way to create a task is to come down you want to come to the option next to actions and click add task and that appears so now i can say test one two three and that task is now i'll create it and i can very easily click the arrow and test one two three can actually have its own notes and i can create a due date for the task i can make that on the 30th and go back to the list and that's just as easy as that any tasks that you select let's say i've got this task for between ninth but i really don't want it on the 29th i one another thirtieth there are two ways to move that task around click on count actions and move it down and now under the thirtieth or i can take any task and i can drag and drop it from the 28th to between the ninth is just that easy other actions to perform let's say i want to print out my to - do list the very first thing i want to do first of all is i want to well here's the print task list first i want a view mine in order so let's this view in my order and as you can see that's the order i put them in and i can put them that way or i can sort by due date which is really the way i want you to do it because that helps you understand which dates are first that i get the ones done in the 18th before go the 21st and now i'm able to print and that print will be based on that order so print tactless you can see it comes up there we go i have now all of my task list in the order in which i have assigned them on my calendar it's just baby so now i can go back here let's say there is the task like this one right here that i want to delete then all i need to do is if the garbage can it deletes that task read that book she said that was just a task that i made up so i'm going to delete it and it's gone if any time i have a completed task i can mark it complete from here i can simply come down here and click into the box and it automatically deletes it and i can change my mind if it's not completed i can actually do that here i can click in the box mark it complete or decide not quite ready uncheck the box and that's it i'll let you play around with some more features but i hope this has helped you learn how to create a task list and print one out and change the date after needed if you have any questions hit me up on the channel love to help you out thanks for watching you",

        "video_sub_title": "i love is welcome back so so this tutorial is going to be on how i tie my turbine stroke battle rap which i've i choose to call it this was what i wore in my beauty and skincare series video if you haven't seen that already you should because it's really informative and this scarf or rap is perfect for any events or for a bad hair day so let's jump right into the tutorial i'm starting off with my hair braided all back nothing on it because i don't have any intentions on i'm going to be using three scoffs one is a satin scarf the other is going to be posh minute which is quite thick and mine is really long and fat's in wheat so i'm going to fold mine into two and then i'm using its silk lights cuff this cuff is really light it's also as long as a pashmina and yeah i'm starting with a satin scarf i'm going to make sure that one end is really short while the rest of the nice is on the other side i'm talking in the really short end under the longer end of this cuff this is going to secure that short end and help us have more of the long end to go around the head so i'm going to take the longer and round the perimeter of my head until i get to the end of the scarf which i would then talk in that end to wherever i this cuff ends like i'm doing right now so make sure that all ends are tucked in properly that's the secret to this wrap make sure that all ends are properly talking now if you have hair extensions or anything then you can actually skip this step what if you're like me that you're just using your natural hair braided all back then you will need a scalloped fee for the wrap so for this i'm using the pashmina like i said earlier the spatula is really thick and long and i'm repeating the same process making sure that one end is really short which gives us more room for more wraps so i'm one ended release shot and that shot end goes on that the longer end of the scarf make sure that you make it a bit tight but not too tight so that you don't have a headache and then i'm grabbing everything together into one long line and crossing around the perimeter of my head another secret to this is to make sure that if you want the stuff really long if you want the wrap really long in height then you have to take the layers of the scarf over each other not on top of each other so it has to keep going up to make sure that your stuff or wrap gets the desired height and if you think that one scarf is not enough for you feel free to use as many stars as you want until you get the desired height i'm okay with just one stuff and it's going to give me an average height i'm making sure that it's perfectly arranged and i'm talking all loose ends so i'm going to show you guys two styles the first style is going to give you the criss cross style in front and this time i'm taking this cuff to the front i'm starting with the front i'm talking in those ends to help me hold or have a better grip of the longer stuff and i'm tightly crossing over not too tight like i said but tight enough to make sure that the shorter end doesn't come off and this time i'm using these costly affair cuff to cover the skeleton we had under and that was formed using the pashmina and i'm repeating the same process taking this cuff over the perimeter of my head until i get to the end of the scarf which i will then talking that then to wherever the scuffle if that makes any sense what you guys are going to see that final tip here is to make sure that you are range for me and then shake the spot by pressing together if you one side it's too fast i will give you a longer and meter look and there goes style number one percent of solemn justice tip of the last cuff you have on and this time i'm going to be starting from the back this process is us is the same process we use for the stuffings cuff and the pashmina making sure that we show the endings on one side and the rest of the lenses on the other side taking the shorter and under the longer now this time you have to make sure that this cuff is laying flat over your forehead so the only way to undo this is to ensure that you drag it tight enough but not too tight to lay flat then you take the shorter end in holding it firmly you drag the longer end out remember to make sure that all news ends are talking as you can see me doing then you take the rest of the right blend and wrap it round neatly this time this is the last card so make sure i dream firm to give you a really quick then talking back remember to ship the stuff and once you're done you're good to go so i hope you really enjoyed this tutorial remember to give this to a thumbs up if you liked it and subscribe to my channel if you are yet if you are yet to see that video that i was talking about at the beginning i'm going to leave a link to it in the description box and be sure to check it out trust me it's really real for me too so that's it guys i hope you liked it and i'll see you guys next friday bye yada yada",

        "video_sub_title": "what's going on guys test your levels here welcome to the channel today we're going to discuss shbg and some supplements that you can take to lower your shbg so a lot of men have an issue where they have normal total testosterone but their free testosterone is low this means that their body has less testosterone that can actually use and this can cause symptoms of low testosterone even when your total testosterone test pretty normal shbg or sexual hormone binding globulin it can be one of the biggest causes of this issue so shbg binds to your testosterone and when it's too high it binds up a lot more of your testosterone leave them with your body with less testosterone to actually use so you can feel good there are a lot of factors that can cause shbg to be high genetics extra body fat drinking alcohol a low protein diet but outside of lifestyle there are some supplements that have been shown to lower shbg levels but keep in mind that everyone reacts differently to different supplements so these may or may not work for you or they may work not as well as for some other people you should always consult your doctor before taking any supplements as you could have interactions so check with your doctor and make sure it's okay to take either of these vitamin d3 is all - around good supplement for men on trt and men in general it has been shown to raise testosterone levels while also slightly lowering shbg levels the first men's clinic that actually went to they were the ones that told me to take 5, 000 iu's of d3 every day they said basically it should be a staple for every man on trt i'm still taking vitamin d3 to this day and i actually have the same bottles when i started because it's like 400 capsules for like eight or ten bucks i actually have an amazon link in the description if you want to check out the vitamin d3 that i take or you can search around fine another type of d3 but 5, 000 iu seems to be the sweet spot to take but the supplement that prompted this video is boron and boron is a really good supplement and it does a lot of things in human body it's been shown to improve brain function lower issues with arthritis it can help metabolize insulin and can help with kidney stones it can support metabolic processes and can protect against oxidative stress but outside of those benefits boron has been shown in studies to raise free testosterone up to 28 % by helping lower shbg but please keep in mind your mileage may vary another interesting aspect of boron is that in different studies it has shown to do different things to estrogen levels in a one week study of men taking boron they saw a 39 percent decrease in estrogen however in a four week study this study showed that boron actually increased men's estrogen levels so be sure to monitor any estrogens like symptoms either low or high while taking boron some people recommend taking boron for two weeks on one week off two weeks on one week off i can't personally attest if this works because i actually have lower shbg so i've never taken boron but that's what some people say if you're having some issues with the estrogen while you're taking it that could be something to try the typical dose when you're supplementing with boron is 10 milligrams per day and if you're not into taking supplements especially poron you can actually get a decent amount of boron from food but it's probably not going to hit that 10 milligram mark these foods are walnut broccoli avocado almonds and raisins so thanks for watching guys i hope you found this video informative if you did smash the like button if you want to see some more interesting stuff on trt and just support a little smaller youtube guy click on that red subscribe button thanks for watching guys love to see you here i'm gonna put some videos right here and i'm gonna put a subscribe button right there you know you want to smash it thanks for watching as always get your levels tested [ music ]",

        "video_sub_title": "welcome to victory cigars my name is kevin i'm one of the owners of the shop here uh today we're going to go through some simple steps on how to season a humidor it's important to note that you can't put cigars into your brand new humidor you need to do a seasoning on it first otherwise your cigars are just going to dry out what we're going to do today is show you the simple steps on how to do it first thing you're going to do is you're going to take your humidor out of the box you're going to open her all up take out the he uh take it all the styrofoam and everything and away we go next step is to get all the parts ready uh you're going to you may have a spanish cedar tray in there you'd likely have some spanish cedar dividers in there we're going to get those all ready to go also you're going to need to take the metal plates off the back of the humidifier and we're going to stick those to the humidor you're also going to see one on the hygrometer as well we're going to stick that inside there and stick it right to the wood and you're ready to go for seasoning your human or you're going to need a couple of things first off you're going to need a bit of distilled water you're also going to need a towel we don't want to use anything like paper towel or anything like that just because you're going to leave paper marks inside the humidor towel works great really simple stuff what you need to do is you need to take the towel dip it into the water give it a good little ring out and put it down and we're going to start wiping down the inside of the humidor see i was changing color nicely like that that's exactly what you want to see you want to get a nice little discoloration of the wood that just shows that it's all being wiped down properly and we don't want any standing water any pooling water and you also want to make sure you get around these edges as well you want to get the whole seam all the way around the humidor and that's going to be perfect for the humidor so you're going to uh you're going to make sure that you do this once every 12 hours you're going to do this about three times that's going to be perfect for your humidor that's going to get it all set up and ready to go so you're going to continue to wipe down the inside of the humidor you may want to take your hygrometer and your humidifier off just to make sure you can get everywhere on the inside of this thing okay around everywhere you can get before the barrier here we don't want to have any uh excess water in here so just make sure that you uh you go over it really well and make sure it's nicely wiped down i think we're ready to go all right so you've wiped down the inside of your humidor your next step is to pour your humidor solution into your humidifier we like to use propylene glycol propylene glycol is calibrated to 70 humidity which is exactly what your humidor should run at it's also got an anti - fungal agent in it so you never have to worry about any sort of spores growing inside your humidor you're going to give the propane glycol a little bit of a shake open her up and we're just basically going to pour that into the humidifier it's going to saturate in you're going to wipe off the excess that's on top and just going to give it a little shake just to make sure nothing's going to drip into your into your humidor onto your cigars and you're ready to go pop it back in your humidor all right our next step is to calibrate our hygrometer it's important to calibrate your hygrometer before you put it in your humidor just to make sure it's zeroed out as they say we like to use a boveda one step calibration bag real simple stuff basically just open the bag insert your hygrometer into the bag close it back up and leave it for 24 to 36 hours if after 24 to 36 hours it doesn't read 75 percent then what you need to do is you need to take a flat head screwdriver and adjust it on the back real simple stuff take a little flathead screwdriver give it a little twist and you're going to adjust it to 75 and you're ready to go all right so we've wiped down the inside of the humidor we've put our propylene glycol in our humidifier and we've calibrated our hygrometer we're basically almost there we just need a bit of time now i like to wipe down the humidor once every 12 hours do that about three times and that'll be perfect any other questions you might have you can visit us at victorycigars. ca or drop into the shop in oshawa we'll be glad to help",

        "video_sub_title": "hi i'm bob shrum physical therapist brad heine physical therapist together we are the most famous physical therapist on the internet and i'll period of course bob all right brad today we're going to talk about bone on bit bone hip arthritis and you know just because you have it doesn't mean that you have to live with the pain you can i think we can knock pain down a little bit very some of these things now first off what are we talking about when we have bone on bone arthritis the cartilage is wore off and we're going right bone to bone in the hip joint itself yep and what you're going to find i'm gonna come a little bit closer lonnie are you right there now this this bolt isn't in your hip you don't have that by the way but this is the smooth surface of the the femur that fits into the socket over here you want to spin that break up there's a socket right up in here and on this smooth surface actually what gives it makes it smooth is a thin cartilage that's very slippery very strong hyaline cartilage but after a while it starts to wear off as you age right and brad kind of described it as being almost like it's rusty okay it's flaking off and it's eventually you have pockets and divots and and it's actually just going to be wall wore away right so you got that ball and socket and it was smooth and slippery and gliding and quiet and all the sudden starts making noises pain associated with it so how are you going to deal with that before you know you don't want to have surgery and how can you manage the pain right first of all what you should understand about this is the pain tends to flare up and it tends to calm down so if you're in a flare - up what you the one thing you want to going to try is using a cane right brad you want to go ahead dempster so here we go it's got the left hip is the problem here you're going to take the cane in the opposite hand right a lot of people will will think it's in the same leg but you go to the opposite okay and they've done studies on that and why it works and just believe if that's the way it works what you need to walk when the cane goes forward left leg goes forward and that's the natural sequence of the arm and the leg anyways so i'm taking weight off of this hip by going through this cane and it gives you better balance as well amazing how this makes them i would think of all the things we're gonna recommend today this is the most important writer you get it calm down you can get rid of the cane again right but i always get a kick out of bread a lot of people say well i'm not going to use a cane it makes me look old right but instead they'll walk like this yeah they're they're limping around and it which works looks much worse than using a cane right so yeah that gives you a little look of distinction that's right all right the second thing you want to do is actually going to do some hip stretches bread that's and the reason we're going to do these stretches is a lot of times with arthritis the hip becomes tight it's not moving as well and so now instead of the forces being spread out throughout the entire ball here it's just working on a small part of the ball right it's and that's getting wore out faster so you want to make sure you keep the hip stretched health as much as possible and make sure your knees not falling off because that's not going to help this is interesting bob because actually just yesterday i worked with a patient hip arthritis and we're going to be doing these same stretches on her that wonderful well do you want to be in a stretcher sure should lay down and get this now right there bob on your back you meet it all you're gonna i thought you're gonna be this oh yeah all right we're ready okay probably just hip flexion right so you're going to go ahead and just go ahead and bring it up and give it up a little yank now the woman i have yesterday she can get up about two here she's right she can i get past 90 degrees so we're going to work on that gently so you grab around the knee or you grab under here and getting it that far okay okay how about a hip rotation and you can do rotations by just rocking back and forth like this but you can also do and this is a good one to do every morning when you wake up just start getting the hip moving a little back a little a little back - you can do the figure four stretch now you can do that in a number of ways but one you could just cross over like this and a lot of people aren't going to have much motion in this one are they but it might be painful so you have to you know it should not be any sharp pain stretch pain is all we're looking for if you are somewhat mobile you might even try putting it up like this and stretching it down and push it a little bit with your hand but most people are going to probably up like this i did have just recently he was 87 years old and he could do this and we could actually help his hip all by that so sometimes it works i'm alright how about a hip extension stretch this is one where you would actually go to the edge of the bed please don't fall off right and you're going to bring one leg off and you're trying to stretch the leg down this way a little bit right so you're getting that stretch right up in here then to make it even worse you pull this one up at the same time what you mean just more aggressive on the stretch that's right yeah if you got a lot of arthritis you might have to start with someone holding this right and and working it gently all right any other stretch spread and there's one that this has worked really well with this person same person both our hips are bad one's a lot worse than the other just get yourself straight now bob you're kinda crooked there oh sorry oh yeah and this is something you can do all just take the leg and you have a family member friend and gently pull and the only reason you're going to do it is because bob or the person that's having the treatment is going to say oh does that feel good just hold that and if they'd if it doesn't feel real good you don't do it right it's very clear you pull and it's not very hard and they say oh just hold it for another you know you'll hold it for about thirty seconds you get tired and then you give it a break that stretch that capsule a little bit and give a little traction to it so all right the third thing you're going to want to do joints love movement mm - hmm and i went through down if they're not getting what happens is you start having hip pain so you move less right and you stop walking as much you stop moving as much totally so what you want to do is try to find a way to get some movement without weight - bearing sure so our little weight bearing one thing that's great is biking mm - hmm another one is swimming ready if you got a pool and you like to get the water that is wonderful another thing we've shown in some of our other videos is you can take the what it's called the e1000 elliptical it's this little machine and it's a pedal machine and you can actually sit down and pedal you can sit right in your dining room chair and put it out and it gets those hips moving it's not a lot but yeah it gets a movie yes it gets a little more nutrition to the joint and gets a little more blood flow into the joint and as far as biking bobby mentioned biking outside bike possibly but a stationary bike or a recumbent bike where you sit in in a chair like this you know you have to spend a little money or if you belong to a fitness center the way yep you're sitting there and you're pedaling like so wonderful for the hip right alright last thing you want to do is you're going to want to strengthen the hip so and the easiest way to do that is what we call straight leg raises times three sure so you start off you're in the bed i'm going to be strengthening this one right here you want to talk more bread sort and it's important to have this leg up like this it takes stress off the back and it makes a little easier and you're going to lift up now this is more more aggressive it's harder than you think you know yeah so if that's too heavy you might have someone help okay or you might go here and it's a little less and just bring them out just to start off there right because when you got long legs like me this is a lot of work you better believe i'll hold it for ten if you can or one two three four five six seven eight nine ten about seven seconds four seconds and you might start out with just doing the motion without holding it and working your way up to that isometric hold then you can lay on your side i'm going to switch to this one brad yep can i get bend this leg yeah and this is a nice one for that hip abductor this one can help that waddling from becoming less when you do this exercise so it's up and then down and the same thing you may only go up and down and as you get stronger you can bend the knee and go like this to start off way up okay and how many reps brad would you say i like to stick around ten reps okay you could do less or you could do a little more and if you're stronger to get pretty good you can bring that up higher as well okay just don't kick anybody in ahead the chuck norris kick yeah all right last one you can actually lay on your stomach and lift up this way and bob would normally lay flat yeah this microphone is on i wish i don't squish up my microphone a standing one real quick brad would be a good one for the hip abductors to hold on to a chair and it just worked on doing these sure so well throw these into your repertoire and you know you don't have to suffer from pain what with bone - on - bone hip arthritis at least you can knock it down a bit let's all right improve you better believe it so keep on moving and things are going to keep feeling better thanks",

        "video_sub_title": "hello guys welcome to cacique creations my name is ashley and today i will be showing you how i to the rose quartz soap that is the brambleberry fragrance and as you can see does have slight acceleration and i will be doing a in pot swirl so we're gonna have to work quickly with this i was so proud to have everything nice and clean and then bright like about five seconds ago i made a little spill over here but i'm just gonna have to let that go because my little one isn't that time and i don't know how long i have to do this soap so and i want to make sure i make the video for it so we're gonna go ahead and get started so our base colors for today as you can see are going to be titanium dioxide so white and then a pink i'm using magenta mica by brambleberry i'm hoping to go for a very light pink though cause the color the scent this rose quartz i'm gonna go ahead and get started again because there's light acceleration in the fragrance and i'm soaping at room temperature these are all within about 70 something degrees so and it's pretty cool up here so we're going to go ahead and i'm gonna barely get this to trace i'm probably just gonna multiply it and stop there oh i'm missing my gloves aren't i can't soap it up gloves okay so i'm back with gloves that's tucked now we're going to go ahead so we are done with that part we're going to go ahead and do bright these when i put the penguin here since it's a in pups world i'm using this one because of the spout of it goes in deeper then we're make sure it penetrates everything so i'm going to go ahead and add my titanium dioxide to this and my magenta mica so i'm gonna add it all because i like i said i want a very light color so i want to make sure it's nice and light without having to add too much okay so i just mixed in my my fragrance so now i'm going to start doing my in putz world so i'm gonna do kind of if you're looking at a clock i'm gonna do it in four parts i'm gonna do it at 12 o'clock then do it at three six and nine i'm gonna try not to move it too much i'm not too big of a deal if you do but if you want a really nice marbled look i'm gonna try and be consistent by the way i'm piping today today is monday because era is supposed to be coming we're supposed to be getting the her hit which isn't direct hit it's kind of the winds and rain that she's bringing to the my area so that's supposed to get tomorrow so i'm not sure if i'm gonna have electricity or not so i want to make sure i get my soaping done to date all right and now i'll look at my little tiny chopsticks i'm gonna start here at 6 o'clock i'm just going to swirl twice and that is it that's all i am doing and then we're just going to start pouring so i like that this is like really light i don't want it to be too overwhelming so very liquidy which is perfect for some squirrels so i was some extra mica here as you can see and i'm gonna grab a pipette and we're just gonna try and do some design especially since it is so liquidy because we definitely want to do some texture so we're gonna have to wait for it to set just a tiny bit okay that should be enough most of the time i'm never happy with the first one so i always play with it until i reach a design that i like and like i said we're going to be texturizing this anyway so i'm pretty much just doing this to get the top some personality all right i think i'm happy with that look so i'm gonna wait for it to start setting up a little bit and then i have these little embeds that i made with melt and pour soap with white melt and pour soap and then i added i colored it with berry red from tkb and i also put some iridescent glitter on there so you can see a little bit of sparkle if you can littering you guys back whenever it's ready to texturize alright guys so we are back and ready to get to target on the fun stuff we are going to decorate the top i forgot to mention i have salts i have some epsom salts that i have colored to decorate this soap with also so we are just just over here so i'm gonna put a gem on one side and then i'm going to put a some salt on the other side so this is my my 12 inch tall bar talk tall mold from bramble berry and i've been using it a lot lately probably does it makes smaller batches so i've been doing that in it i really like the way they turn out i like the tall ones i think especially for men which obviously this isn't a very male soap at all but i really like them for i think my manly soaps just because i think men are more about how it functions than what it looks like so we gonna have a little bar that's really nice smells really nice and also functions very well for them because someone usually grab them and then they've twisted in their hands or whatever so i really think that they would prefer a taller but skinnier bar that they it's easily easier for them to use i'm not obviously piping these soaps i'm trying to haven't done a piping so actually if since my halloween so i'm actually doing these lightly i think they're a little bit easier and i think a lot of people may not necessarily like the whole topping piping baked things so i've been kind of leaning towards these and makes a smaller bar which also means i can sell it for a little bit less and make it a little bit more affordable for people so and now i don't know if i want to put this in the middle or the side or i have not figured that out yet i want to put it like this might have a feeling some of these are gonna get cut out during the cutter i'm gonna have to cut them man really alright guys so as you can see i put all the embas turns out i was short one but think they had me a couple little ones that the extra so that turned out that worked out and i'm just to put a little bit of snowflake sparkle mica from brambleberry. com stuff you probably want some sparkle so all right l also by the way the way i this is epsom salt i know some people like to use sea salt to decorate or soaps i figured epsom salt is a little bit more bath related so and gives benefits to the skin and the in the bath water so i'm using that one instead and all i did to color it there's a bunch of different ways you can color it the way i did it today was kind of like i do to prepare my mica below gonna oil and a little bit of a used grapeseed oil and a little bit of mica i swirled it together and then i put the salts in to absorb that and you need more salt than oil to make sure they're not too wet this is what it looks like and if you have a lot left over you can use these for yourself um you can make it colored bath you can make use these for four foot soaps you can use these for foot scrubs you can use these for what is the word i'm trying to look for bath bombs thank you yeah for bath bombs so these are great for decorating bath bombs and putting them in there and i just made a mess so these have so much usage and they're so easy to make and look so pretty in the finished product so i'm gonna give you a quick close up and then we'll come back tomorrow to see the cutting of it alright guys so here is the close - up i cannot wait until tomorrow to cut this and see how it turned out the fragrance it's amazing my rose quartz fragrance it's really nice so i hope you guys enjoyed it and i'll see you tomorrow to cut it right guys we'll come back to the cutting it's been almost 24 hours and about 20 82 so as you can see i'm very excited about this one and it smells so good it smells even stronger today so i'm just gonna turn this sideways because i don't want the probably i don't want the salts to kind of go through the wool soap and ruin it and put marks all over it so some of the jumps are gonna get cut but you know what it will be over see [ music ] that little squealing is my son all right so here we go so again this smells so good and i already made a lotion with this scent that looks really nice i really like the way this looks so we have the top and then a center i'm assuming what happened what the reason there's thicker chunks at the bottom i'm assuming what happened is perhaps the little chopsticks that i used weren't long enough to reach the bottom off the bowl and that's why it looks a little thicker at the bottom i still really like the way that looks though so i'm very happy the way this turned on and like i said it smells so good so i made a lotion like i said with this scent so i'm probably gonna put this up both individually and as a bundle with a discount wow this smells so good so here is the lotion that i make it's very simple and it's nice and thick so it's perfect for the weather that's coming now so this will be sold as a bundle or they'll be an option for the bundle and my next one the next open i'm making this week it's the lemon cake which i also have a lotion form is actually my favorite scent in the lotion eyes and that one will have piping obviously because lemon cake has frosting so i'm very sad about that one so that will be coming soon i will hopefully get a chance to record that one to show you guys so thank you so much for watching if you would like to like this video comment and perhaps even subscribe i have lots of cool soaps coming and if you'd like to see some lotions please let no i'm more than happy to post a video about that i will actually be making a cucumber lotion sitting with cucumber extract so it's going to be extremely moisturizing and healthy plate of skin because joey has something to say to you what is it you didn't like that alright guys thanks for watching again have a wonderful day",

you could actually just apply this on the lid and blend it out with your finger into the crease and not do anything else but of course i wanted to take it a step further so i applied this to the lids in about two to three layers and then i went ahead and started darkening up that outer corner with this black shadow from the neutrogena nourishing long wear eyeshadow palette called smokey steal using a pencil brush i am bringing this from the outer corner like the very outer edges and then pushing it up into that crease and now i'm going in with this brown shade it is from another palette called the called coco mall and we're bringing this through the crease as a transition color to blend those two shadows together for eyeliner we're going back into that navy black shade and using a really small angled brush to work this right where the lashes grow and then i'm also extending this into that outer v i decided to go in with the neutrogena naturals healthy links mascara in black i am applying about two to three coats of this just on the top lashes for now and then i decided to go in with these tiny little half lashes just for some more extra length on those outer corners now going in with the neutrogena naturals nourishing long wear makeup foundation this is in the shade fresh page i am applied this all over the entire face now i absolutely love this foundation i think it is so gorgeous it gives me that nice tan a really nice glow it covers everything so amazingly and it is yeah definitely one of my favorites from the drugstore right now then i went over it with the neutrogena naturals healthy skin villains translucent oil control powder this is in the shade number 10 clean and i'm literally just applying this everywhere except for where i'm going to be applying concealer so to the outer corners of the nose the adequate is on my forehead around the temple area also along the chin and the neck and what this is going to do is really set that foundation in place this one has a very what sword like oily consistency to it so it works honestly perfectly for my dry skin but i feel like you know you definitely need to set it so this just really helps you know to mattify the foundation a bit and then i'm going back in with the same concealer i used earlier and applying this under the eye area and then on the nose the bridge of the nose for a little bit of a highlight the middle of the forehead medal of the chin and lee cupid's bow and then blending this out with the same foundation brush i had used earlier because that just helps the foundation and the concealer to meld in together i think this is the most perfect combination this concealer with that foundation they really do work well together for those harder to reach areas like the inner corner of my eye i'll usually use my fingertip just tap very lightly to blend out that concealer and then i'll go back in again with my brush to blend out the bridge of my nose and in the forehead area then i just went over my under eye area nose forehead chin cupid's bow everywhere i just applied my concealer and set it in place with that same powder we had used on the rest of the face was really nice about that powder is that it actually has like different tiny little squares in it so you can you know pick and choose which squares you want to run your brush in and then apply it to your face there's some darker squares some lighter square this is a really cool powder to work with so then i just lightly went over with some bronzer to contour out those cheekbones and i also used some blush as well but this was a really really light pink shade with a little bit of shimmer in it so it kind of worked as a blush and a highlight mixed into one just you know for a little bit of color to the face now going back to the under eye area i am picking up that same black shade we used earlier with an angle brush and applying this right where the lashes grow and then i'm gently massaging this area to make it look more smoky and going over once again with more color that way the outer corner of the under eye area is smoked out but still there is some definition to it and then i decided that i wanted to bring that liner all the way into the inner corner so i went ahead and did that going back in with the same mascara once again and applying this to the lower lashes this is actually surprisingly a really nice mascara for both top and bottom lashes this is the first time i've ever used it i really was shocked because usually with a mascara it'll only work for me for either the top lashes or the bottom lashes but this one truly didn't work for both like you could see how amazing it separated my lashes without them looking clumpy i really enjoyed this mascara i like using it and i'll definitely be using it again for future tutorials i went in with my favorite color stick from neutrogena naturals in the shade soft raspberry it is the most perfect everyday shade it moisturizes the lips like no other i use these all the time you guys to see me talk about this one a lot in other videos but that is it for the completed look hopefully you guys enjoyed this tutorial if you found it helpful please give it a thumbs up it's all forget to subscribe to my channel leave a comment down below for me let me know if you decide to try out this look i think it would be perfect for spring definitely easy to do and i really like it i like those cool tone shadows it's a little different so anyways thank you guys for watching i love you and i'll see you next time bye",

        "video_sub_title": "[ music ] hi everyone welcome to my channel my name is deanna and i'm a women's health nurse practitioner on today's video i'm going to be talking about vaginal infections whether you have had a bunch and you're just like what is going on here or maybe you don't want to uh just rely on antibiotics and prescription medications and you're considering a more natural approach then this video is for you if you like this video make sure to give me a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel to watch different videos on all things women's health comment below if you have any questions or any topics that you want me to cover for sure and don't forget to check out my instagram at underscore the ladies guide i love interacting with you over there as well sharing all kinds of information and things that you guys want to hear more of so that's what i'm all about so vaginal infections i know it's something nobody wants to really talk about and it's something though that is so common i would say that 80 of the women that i see it is in relation to a vaginal infection and the issue becomes when it's all the time that you're experiencing this and kind of seeing what else could be going on that could be causing this so 101 the first thing that is crucial if you forget everything else that i said please remember this don't douche don't use any kind of feminine hygiene product that i know is on the market that says that it's the best thing for your vagina it is not your vagina is a self - cleaning oven it actually is miraculously good at keeping everything in balance all on its own and when you use products like soaps that go inside sprays powders things that claim they're great for ph control scent control no no no please don't use those products what ends up happening a lot is they get rid of the good bacteria that's supposed to be there to keep everything healthy and imbalanced and it leads to an imbalance they're supposed to be healthy bacteria and yeast in the vagina that keeps everything in balance so when you use those products a lot of times just throws things off and then you end up with an infection so often one of the things that i see is that particularly with bacterial vaginosis which is an infection that the main symptoms is usually an odor a very strong odor and what i see often is women will experience the odor and they'll go and buy these products that claim they're good for odor and they use the products and then they feel but they're still an odor so let me use more of that product and it continues you continue to go in this like spiral and you really are just masking bacterial vaginosis which usually um one of the treatment options is an antibiotic so it's something that you don't want to just be trying to self - treat or clean yourself with those products they cause more harm than good so really less is more warm water to the area and that is it you don't have to put any soap outside or inside the vagina please out of all things if you forget everything else that is key okay so save your money ladies and stop buying those products second thing is that you want to try to wear cotton underwear avoiding tight clothes as well any kind of sweaty clothes that you're making sure you're washing and getting out of those clothes so like yoga pants leggings not the best thing to stay in all day especially if you are working out and then you don't change out of those clothes that is a perfect environment usually for yeast to grow in abundance which you don't want you want a healthy level of yeast but not an overgrowth of yeast and yeast like to grow in dark moist environments so it's best to change out of those clothes same goes for bathing suits that you're not sitting in a bathing suit all day often you know i hear women go on vacation they go to the beach they had a weekend and then they end up with this with a yeast infection is a common concern so definitely just making sure you have a change of clothes so you can change out of these are easy things to do to prevent vaginal infections from even happening to begin with or if they're reoccurring for you for sure other thing that is very important is that you're always urinating after intercourse always it helps flush out any bacteria that could be near the vaginal area or the urethra that also kind of helps to prevent urinary tract infections as well so something else to keep in mind for sure um now what if you are somebody who you're doing all of those things and you're still getting infections you're like what is going on i hate having to go in over and over for medications nonstop then it's really important to look further into what might be going on with your food intake and what supplements or a probiotic that could help that could be lacking that is why part of the problem of what's going on so there's a lot of studies out there that show that gut health and vaginal health are very closely related and when you're over using antibiotics which unfortunately we live in a country where that is the case it can affect our gut health which then also affects our vaginal health so if you're somebody who has used gone through periods of time we're using a lot of antibiotics or maybe you have bacterial vaginosis and it's antibiotic after antibiotic like what is going on here and then it's important to really we should all it's a good idea to consider supplementing with a probiotic particularly for vaginal health there are a million probiotics out there and they're not all the same they all have different strains of probiotics and basically the capsules have healthy bacteria that help promote a balance within the body and there's ones for gut health and there's ones for vaginal health so it's important to make sure you're getting one that's specific for vaginal health if that is your particular concern and do your research they're not all treated the same and there's a lot of different options out there but that's definitely something that when i see women are continuing to have them over and over again and really don't want to continue using medications prescription medications adding a probiotic can be helpful as a preventative for sure the other thing that is also key is looking at your food intake and particularly if you're getting recurrent yeast infections one thing that i always recommend is checking with your primary and seeing if you've had a recent lab done for your blood sugar and making sure that you are not in the early stages of diabetes this is actually a sign when you're getting recurrent yeast infections it could sometimes be indicating really that you are pre - diabetic so blood work done particularly a hemoglobin a1c is a great way to see where your blood sugar has been the average of your blood sugar over the past three months so it gives a good gauge if you fully are in the pre - diabetic range or not or your diabetic so definitely checking in with your provider and getting that lab done is important if you're getting these infections all the time and you feel like you're doing all the things and it's just not working but if that checks out okay the other thing that you want to be mindful of is that you're not overdoing it with white processed carbs so that's pasta bread rice that all converts into sugar any kind of fast food baked goods cookies candy all of that all of that is sugar and yeast like to grow in sugar so even if you are not considered diabetic eating these things can promote the yeast to continue to keep growing so you want to really cut that down eating more whole foods in your diet and you may notice through all of those changes that the yeast infections stop if that has been your main concern for you those other tips that i have is to consider switching to using a menstrual cup during your period at the least changing to organic pads and organic tampons i always recommend that if you recently had an infection not to use tampons for at least your next cycle if you are a tampon user i find that that helps to reduce the chances of an infection occurring again but menstrual cups is really a great way to help minimize recurrent infections it helps promote your vaginal health so that is key and also using a non - scented soap so sorry i know those scented products they smell so good for the body but sometimes if particularly if you're somebody who is like has done all the things just make sure you're using a non - scented soap for your body because even if a little bit gets over in the vulva and the vaginal area this can sometimes be enough to create irritation and imbalance so those are a few tips to consider if you either need to prevent them to begin with or you are somebody who is experiencing them more often than not and you are at your wit's end of what could be going on so these are all very helpful tools to use also always important to see your provider if you're experiencing these symptoms itching odor burning sensation any abnormal discharge that just doesn't look like you're your norm it's always best to check in with the provider this video is not meant at all to replace seeing your provider in person to have a thorough evaluation and also make sure that there's no kind of more harmful infection going on really the only way to determine that is through an exam and through testing so with those once that is kind of squared away and assessed then you know it's a great idea to have a discussion with your provider if you are trying to figure out what other things can be done and this these are great tips and tools for you as well to keep in mind so i hope you like this video don't forget to like and subscribe to my channel check me out on my instagram i'm over at underscore the ladies guide i love interacting with you all thank you so much and i look forward to seeing you in my next video [ music ] bye [ music ] you",

        "video_title": "The AG Guide : Double French Braids",
        "video_sub_title": "hey everyone it's debbie and today i'll be showing you how to your french braid in this video we will be doing two french braids down either side of her head so i already did one side to save um to make this video a little shorter so as you can see it is it does turn i mean normally french braids just go straight back but i like mine to turn around here and um yeah so i'm going to show you how to do it this way and the other way also on in which it goes all the way back so yeah so um let's just start with the other side because i already finished inside so first i'm going to take a section over here um really really close to your part um and leave that to the side i'm just going to take a bobby pin like this and one second okay so i'm just going to pin it on to the other side i do this because i don't want to entire hair to be pulled back i wanted to like some of it to come down the side nor as if when naturally so then you want to take the front section of the hair like this yeah it's better if it's more wide than if it's feeling i'm skinny and narrow because the more narrow it is the 10 - year the braid will be and i personally don't like really really knew your braids but yeah if you like them then you can do that but i don't like them so um you're going to take a section of your hair from the front and i take mine directly above her eye because the elastics where i do it you can do it closer and closer to her here whatever you want and then you split it into three sections like that you take the section closest to the hair part and cross it over the middle section pizza then you take the new section closest to her part and add a little bit of hair to it see so now you have this see this is the original middle piece which is now consistent or parked because i crossed it off i crossed it under the top piece and i added a little bit of hair truth and you just want to hold on to that then you want to take the bottom section or the one closest to your ear and cross it over the middle section and with the new bottom section you just want to add a little bit of hair from the bottom like how you did with the top and hold on to that then um you take your top section the hair that's added on in the original and cross it over the middle section like that and smooth out any um bumps that you have because i i think it looks better if you smooth them all out it looks much needed neater than then you take um so now with your new top section you add a little bit of hair to it also like how do you did before you take the bottom section cross it over with your middle section and add a little bit of hair to the bottom section and you basically just keep doing this you cross over the top adhered to the top cross over the bottom add the hair to the new bottom just keep doing that i like to do it until on them well see how my doll has a part over here and then like right about here it ends that's about where i stopped doing the braid going backwards well backwards as i mean i mean i'm going back all the way back like that not your house to explain it but um that's about where i stopped going that way but if you want your dolls ready to go all the way down like that then you just continue doing this and um you follow the same technique that i just showed you before um as you did for this but if you wanted to turn and the pony tight ponytail tie things to be closer to the front of her head then do this so i'm just going to turn my dog this way so you can see a little better so that's the french braid so now um you want to turn your doll this way so you're seeing the side of her head and then you just turn everything down like that and then you just continue doing it but if you're since you're facing downwards hill the bridge will just go down it's not that hard at all so you so now there's going to be a front middle and back section instead of top bottom and no no so you take the front section or wherever you work and just keep um french braiding it so i'm going to add a little bit of hair to my back section cross my front section over my middle add hair to the middle cross the top section over the middle adhered to the back across the front section over the middle and you just keep doing that until you reach the end of the head like or the bottom of the head like i have unless you want a one - second see if you have ears okay that's that so if you have this little piece of hair just add it to a section so um it'll just actually go somewhere and so until you reach the bottom of the head unless you want really really high pigtails or braids so since my doll has short hair i'm going well actually i'll just sprayed it and then tie it off but if you're i can't braid very much because my doll has extremely short hair um but if your doll has longer hair you can just continue braiding all the way down until you're you feel like it's good and let's just put it to the front and tyra but since um i don't like having like really really short bright over here i'm just going to tie it up at the bottom of her head the bottom of her hair i'm going to tie it up a bit higher so it's going to be like a french braid and low pigtails then i'm going to unpin this section of my hair hair that i originally left out pick that up and just tie it in with you i accidentally forgot to do this when i was tying it in originally so that's fine you just hired a new so if you don't want to tie then you can just tuck it behind your ear or whatever you want in there there is your french braid see okay so i'm just going to spend my doll around once so you can see all the different sides of it there's the front that's the side the back the other side and the right again so thank you for watching my video i hope you comment rate and subscribe and just tell me how i can improve and anything really",

        "video_sub_title": "hey guys welcome back to jasmine remedies today i have an awesome tutorial that i'm going to share with you all today and it is a mayo and egg hair mask and i know you guys are probably thinking why the hell am i going to put mayo in my hair but it turns out that maewyn egg are great for protein so this is a great protein hair mask so if you guys are looking for anything to help strengthen your hair this is going to be your best friend so strengthening the hair it also moisturizes the hair my hair feels soft silky smooth and that is key moisture and strength for maintaining good healthy hair so if you guys want to find out how to do this hair mask continue watching okay guys so what you will need is honey extra virgin olive oil mayonnaise and 1 egg so we're going to start off with the egg you're going to crack it into a bowl and then you're going to take a fork or whisk and you're going to beat it next we're going to add our mayo i started off with one tablespoon but i finished with a total of three you'll see later on in the video one tablespoon of honey and two tablespoons of extra - virgin olive oil this is for moisture okay so you're going to mix it all up until all of the lumps are completely gone and everything is well mixed together so this is a little bit too liquidy for me so that's why i decided to go back and add two more tablespoons of mayo you can add as much as you'd like i know people that add six tablespoons but i decided to add a total of three when i mixed it up if he came thicker not too thick but it had a nice consistency to it all right so now that it's all mixed up you're going to want to make sure that you have some type of shower cap to contain your hair make sure that you're not wearing a really good shirt because this can get really messy and you're just going to apply it all over your hair making sure that you are getting deep into your scalp as well make sure that you're not neglecting your scalp as you can see my hair is a hotness so it was perfect timing that i decided to do this protein hair mask deep conditioner and yeah so i'm pretty much just working it all into my hair my hair super tangled at the moment so i'm doing the best i can and i'm bringing it down onto my end don't forget to bring it down onto your ends guys sometimes we have a tendency of focusing either on the ends or on the scalp but you want to make sure that you get this conditioner all over your hair and all over your scalp okay so now i'm just working it deep into my scalp to also promote some circulation as well so i'm just through my hair in a bun and then i put the shower cap over top so you're going to wait for about 20 minutes allow the deep conditioner to sit in your hair and for your hair to absorb it and then when you're all ready to go you're going to rinse out the mail conditioner and you're going to wash your hair and there are you done the outcome of the mayo and egg hair mask i love it my hair is super soft it it's nice and full and when i was combing my hair i felt as though my hair was detangled so perhaps the mask even helped with detangling my hair and that's a big thing for me because my hair tangles so easily it takes me anywhere from 25 minutes to 45 minutes for me to comb my hair because it just knots so easily so fast and it's that's one of my biggest pet peeves about my hair is that it just tangles really easily but this hair mask really helped with making it smooth making it soft and i just love the outcome of it geez um i'm probably going to end up twisting my hair after this video anyways though because i do like to do a protective style at least once a week and i do love the curls that i get from the twists out so i'm like a really big twist out fan i always do i always do twist outs probably once once a week maybe twice a week if i have the time and i went ahead and i put a little bit of my hair moisturizer into my hair so i use the coconut oil castor oil lavender and a little bit of rosemary combination and that also helps with the fact that i have an itchy scalp and sometimes i have dandruff so that really helps moisturize my scalp and my hair so i hope you guys enjoyed the video please remember to comment like and subscribe if you want to see some more do it yourselves beauty haircare skincare makeup tutorials if you have any requests let me know i want to hear all about your requests and stay tuned for the next video guys i can't wait to share it with you all take care",

        "video_sub_title": "hi there so in this video i'm going to teach you how to put n and take out a contact lens and beam on petition i have lot of experience in teaching people how to put blinders and i can go over some good tips and do is in terms of quanta lines in general so these are colored monthly contact lenses and basically you keep these for 30 days and you will throw at the end of the 30 days just because there'll be a lot more fun z and we're out after that time they will feel comfortable okay it's what we're going to do is peel open these lenses just going to show you how to do that pretty straightforward just peel open flap and the cover and sterile solution which basically means that it's clean and somebody having a bacteria in the case if you just fresh out the letters like soup and it's very soft content language you can see so i'll just place it onto the tip of my finger you you would dry your hands from the solution nuts in the case just so sticks better than i usually stick so evers the wettest place it on your finger like that and you can see it's a very very soft plastic small plastic lens and you want to just place the aunt your temper your thing like that for easy insertion and make sure you have good grab all of your eyelids like soup and you can just chat like pop lens onto the i let go i should stick so you look all around you and that'll help lenses stick on to the eye okay there you go like the other lands know and same again pure finger try your finger on the tissue it's quite hard to handle at first if you're a beginner but you get used to feeling quite easily place lens onto the finger like that so there is a right to the wrong way around four lenses and this here is the right way around what you can to tell actually but look at the curves at the edges of the lens you'll notice a bit more flattered but fatter whereas it was right around it would be a bit more curved and the edge is fine so this is the wrong way around so you just flipped over onto the curve sometimes helps just to wetlands it's so back to the it's quite hard to tell but you get used to the more experience you have with the condo lenses so the biggest mistake i see my patients make is that they don't have a good grip of the eyelashes of the islands so you want to really grab at the eyelashes white open and tightly so doesn't get in the way and grab the bottom one as well with our finger on pop lens and length school ok that's it try look all around and it was thick then close legal rights lats bullfighters in and i'll go over her tail amount just then so a lot of patients have a problem with touching their eye they have very sensitive eyes especially if not really warm cotton lenses before so one tip i usually get my patients is that if when they're at home and when you're not wearing the lens is just if they can look up periodic down and just touch the white part of the eye every now and again and basically the more that you touch the way provide the less says to the gets and that means when you're putting unz you won't blink as much and there will be a lot easier to insert the lens that we the more you can touch die the white part especially try not to touch the colored part of the eye cause us the part that you've seen through and if you scratched that part then it can be quite painful place or the white part is quite strong so it's quite hard to actually damage the white part of the eye so safer just to try and touch the white part of the eye and a few times a day every day and after the two weeks then the sensitivity will tend to decrease and after the two weeks two or three weeks or so and you'll be a wet sensitive to touch a nice and there will be a lot easier to put lenses in so now i'm going to go over how to take lenses out so basically what you do is you want again a good grip the eyelids so like so ideally want to look up to the ceiling and you drag it down the lens down to the white profit are you want to drag it down twice so the reason that you're dragging it down white part of the eye is because as i said if you scratch the color provide and it can be quite sore and then pinch it with your fourth finger and your thumb and the other one so again good grip of your eyelashes ideally looking up drag the lens down to the white part of the eye dr it twice and pinch off ok and pop the back into the case should i won't say for just a picture of the white parts with it's very hard to scratch that part of the line obviously if you quite new to this it takes practice and once you get hangover is quite using just a pinch off it takes just a couple of second you tend to have a good feel of lens after a whale so that's how you put in and take out contents as i said the most common mistakes see my patients make or that they don't have a good grip of the eyelashes so grabner at the eyelashes peeling that way to open the other mistake is that the patients find a very difficult to pencil ends up by the very tentative about it because obviously there have been one is scratched i this quite says that but the more you can get used to the easier it will be and it just is a lot of practice patience and persistence because these are monthly lenses that i'm practicing with today i'm just going to quickly go over how to clean them and store them as well so i do you want to have some contact lens solution preserve the free is the best to use because it's less like to cause allergies nice and i've read in the day on this bottle just because you might discard solution after three months because then the tent harbor bacteria cause infections so you've got weak ass as well to pop the lenses and usually smart right and left on the case so basically make sure it's full so to clean the lenses you ideally want to pop the lands on the palm of your hand like so and few drops of solution onto the palm of your hands and use your forefinger to rub it in small circles for 10 seconds so rub it in small circles will get rid of what can i loosen up the bacteria and proteins that are stuck on the lens and the metal power plants and robin big circles to clean the outside of the lens for 10 seconds so once you've done that the proteins that are stuck on the lands are loosened and any dark place on the lens you want to give a quick rinse with the solution again and then you can pop it back in the case okay so the main precautions are advised with quanta lenses are that you better not to sleep in the lenses i'll a shelf a special type of lands that's approved for sleeping in and that you're checked by optician the other precaution is best not to swim and lenses because swimming pools as tart water as well in general can have bacteria but if you get any red sore eyes while wearing the clutter lenses your best always taking them out as the saying goes if you're in doubt then take them out so that's us for today and if you have any questions you can pour some comments on the comment section and hopefully that was held for you so we'll be safe and take care see you later",

        "video_sub_title": "amazingly stevie hey guys up is 3mins today i'm here with a really quick a really simple hair tutorial for you guys this is for my signature bun look literally my everyday looks super basic super simple probably one of the most basic yourself in the world but it's my everyday looking at my favorite hair cell because nine times up in my life is in shambles and when your life is in shambles easiest thing to do is to store your hair up in a bun it still looks cute you know it just feels like that edges as being very presentable but it's like the existing in the world and doesn't require a lot of thought process and it goes instant in my sample t - shirt i am selling them so check out the link in the description box if you want to purchase one okay so i'm just gonna do a quick talk through tutorial on how i do my messy bun curly buy whatever you want to call it this is honestly something that i don't really put too much thought into it's not really a big technical process or anything but i think a few requests to do this video so i thought might as well walk you guys through it just in case you want to see exactly my sexy and i know it's different for different hair textures but maybe if your hair texture is similar to mine this might help you and this is kind of like for my advanced immensely fun honestly i wear my hair like this almost every day on a daily basis this is my go - to hairstyle and typically what i do is i don't use any products i don't use any brushes no comb i really just use a hair tie and i get my hair in a bun however it'll get so that's a really really messy bun but this is kind of like my piano i kind of wanted to look a little bit presentable version of my messy bun so i am actually will be using a couple of products i'm going to be using this edge control which is my curls this is the blueberry blitz curl control paste this is one of my favorite edge controls the one that i use before this was by cream of nature and the only other product that i use is some sort of moistening than i hate that word but like wet spray for like a leave - in spray conditioner this is my cream of nature this is their coconut milk detangling and conditioning even conditioner and of course the univer ban or a hairstyle and a palette i call it a hair tie i don't know everybody calls these things something different cause a lot of what you called these things you call it a hair tie i thought here sigh anyway i've used these little clean black ones that are like on when you call it seamless metal if i don't have anything on it that's going to like catch your hair review here they just like nice little soft stretchy ones and i typically did two of them just in case because sometimes it does take two hair ties to get my hair in a button now that it's getting longer and i always have a bobby pins on a deck and the type of brushes that i use when i'm trying to sleep my hair back a little bit more are these like hard boar bristle brushes i think these are called bored bristles but like this this is like the waves brush that most boys carry around but it works for girls to one side a little bit softer one sides a little bit harder if you want like really flick it back and then also this presence is really really hard like if i gave you try to click your brain back there's a grunt and then it was like a little rascal on the end which helps for certain things and then i also keep a little messy grimy toothbrush aunty on this is my edges its toothbrush it has a lot of edge control on it right now so don't judge me but i feel like every girl needs a toothbrush that is dedicated for her baby here i lost my hair last night and then i did put in some leave - in conditioner and then i just let it like air dry and analysis kind of like hey girls we're here but we're not really here to be like just worn like this i mean i guess i could probably you know harden and try to like style it and wear it out but it's just i let it air dry so this is definitely bun worthy hair and it's got parts of it that are just really like frizzy and messed up because i just wasn't really you know doing what i love to do in terms of drying my hair and i know it's going to be doing a bun today anyway so this is good because it does actually have like some defined curls to it and it is nice and big as welcome that my bun come out the best when i actually do have like some you know decent curls going on and like really big curly hair my hair is just completely freeze out or completely just weighed down or just like there's no real good curls going on it won't really hold a big bun so it does kind of help if you have at least something going on with your curls to start off with so my hair is completely dry right now sometimes i do a wet but that's kind of a whole different thing maybe i'll make a separate video on my wet bun but so yeah since my hair is completely dried that's where the leaving spray comes into play so mainly i'm just going to spray this around the front top part of my hair mostly just to get it to where i can kind of flick it down really good and also just to wet my edges so i can do my baby hair and also because i did my makeup first i have foundation all in my hairline does that happen anybody else i just can't do eye makeup put down getting foundation all in my hair because i have dark roots it just looks all dusty and crusty so we all spray it out what's good leave - in conditioner so yeah i just spray it around my hairline and maybe like three inches back but i don't really want to get like the rest of my hair wet and i do spray a little bit in my kitchen on the back well let me right here y'all my hair has grown a lot what we're like i don't even know what to do with it these days all i never really wear it curly because it's like so much hair i'm so he's having short hair cuz i always cut my hair into short styles because bob's whatever i'm just like what am i supposed to do with his hair only one l so i just do buns and then with the softer brush which has here at it don't judge me i didn't plan this video y'all it was an impromptu video this is real life this is like real life tutorial right now so with the sausage that i'm just going to brush through just right on the front not really dragging the brush back too much cuz i don't i messed up my curls necessarily i'm mostly just trying to brush out this makeup around my edges and just kind of get my baby hairs going in the right direction when i do breasts a little bit in the back too but i'm about to show y'all the back of my head because i'm actually really self - conscious about the back of my hair i have insane they haley call baby earth i know what you would call it but my hair on the nape of my neck is so crazy it grows so crazy down the back of my neck like you can see from the side view it just grows a grow it keep growing up all the way down in here and it looks crazy like oh i don't know he just looks crazy and i hate it and sometimes i shave it off but right now is there and it looks great so i'm not going to show you okay i'll show you i mean i guess nothing really to be ashamed of but look at this y'all y'all see that that's crazy isn't it okay so now i'm going to take my x control and my toothbrush and i know everyone has their own favorite edge control that works for their hair this one really does work for my hair though and it smells really really good and i just did my toothbrush in it to get the product out and then what i do is i first swoop it on just once back and then like right here on my temple is where i like to like scoop it more down and into like a little baby hair blue type of thing so that's where the tube brush comes into play but if you don't like the swoop look you can just you know do everything one back but i have like these little broken baby hairs like when people have breakage men i call it baby ears and that's me right now i have breakage like a lot of breakage from my postpartum shutting so all these little hands right here i have to like swoop on and flick them back because they're so short but really my baby and i just be little cute right here but then this is brake engine yeah got no difference between baby and the raikage okay taking the super extra hard brush i'm going to really make sure and get this part now that the edge control is in there now i think my hair time is where you have to stand up and flip your head over to get all your hair at the top of your head so i'm just gathering up all my hair and i try to get it like right at the top of my head but as high of a possible remote whoa we smash girl if it facelift yes and then i just make a ponytail with my hair tied that's kind of hard to my hair getting along it's hard to pull this through but we persevered and then on the second pull through i only pull it through halfway [ music ] yeah how do you pull it halfway through you're going to have all the little extra tails sticking out and it looks like a little nothing i don't know so that i have to go back and kind of like arrange those how i want to tuck it back one way or the other this is where the other hair tie and the bobby pins come into play and i'm just going to squish it all of my hand get my other hair side wrap that around wait now i'm just taking a couple of bobby pins and pinning down whatever needs to be pinned down just kind of shaping my bun a little bit pinning back any loose hair i guess all right really not the best one i've ever done that's the thing about curly hair messy buns is they literally come out at least for me it comes out so different every single time i do it it's like a whole different shape a whole different texture a whole different color because my hair is multiple different color so it just depends on what the milk color is mostly showing but you know i think i got it in a decent shape for now and then the finishing touches fix up my edges a little bit and then i always have to pull down my little comb a little ear hairs my little ear what do you call you single sideburn years i guess i like to take something out and pull these down i feel like they're doing make your vine like this is like the the major key right here is to pull it down and kind of like do like that and then i like to go back with my brush and kind of fix my top of my hair i don't try to make it too perfect because i mean it's like a messy bun anyway kind of so i don't really care if it sticks up a little bit around the front or if you know i have this little seagull curls i like to stick up i'm not trying to like get them to stay down completely because trust me as they won't anyway but i like to at least just have this part you know kind of styled and just kind of make it look a little bit meet around the front at least and my hair is actually long enough these days where i don't need to put any bobby pins in the back of my hair for the longest time i was doing struggle buns and i feel like 16 buttons up the back of my hair because my hair was really long enough either to reach up into the bun so all these i try to fall out in the bathtub with so many bobby pins but now i really don't have to put one bobby pin it all reaches it all holds up by itself yes that's the pretty much it as long as everything stays is the place when i move my head that's what i know that i'm done so hopefully this little tutorial made a sense somewhat at least i know it's kind of just all over the place because honestly there's no real rhyme or reason to it there's no like secret to it at least not for me how i personally do it but i do use two hair ties i do use some bobby pins just to kind of shape it how i want it and yeah let me know in the comments down below what type of natural hair style you would want me to try next i really haven't tried that many different things with my natural hair now that's getting longer so leave your suggestions down below give this video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and i'll see you guys in my next one bye",

boiled egg and i'm good to go which brings me to my next part i myself eat three egg whites every single day and so what i like to do is already have some of our build eggs there so i can just pull the yolk out and eat those and then again i keep my yogurts there and i just stack them love that creamer when we head down on this next shelf i like to keep in the very very back i'll show you in the very back i keep some plums and apricots and things like that so you can grab them if you want them these veggies are from the garden these are zucchini and squash and it's they're so easy you just toss them in the oven on 350 olive oil for a half - hour chop them up they're good to go and they're so tasty and then i just caught some carrots and i like to keep fruit that's already ready to go and already cut up so our strawberries back there and i have a bunch of grapes here so if you wanted to order these containers i'll leave a link below in the description box it's prep naturals that sent me these i absolutely love them the lids are plastic but the containers are glass and i have some chicken salad ready and what i do is i describe some chicken salad and then grapes and i'm good to go i can go do some errands and run around in my car and also for my kids back there i keep some jams jellies and like if they want to dip their apple slices in the caramel they love that so this is my next shelf so this is stuff that's already prepped and ready to roll i keep it at that level by the way because i want my family to look at fruits and vegetables and things rather than at the junk food which a little bit of junk is on the next shelf but i want them grabbing that instead down here some more veggies and leftovers and things like that i have some more chicken salad fill out an easy quick snack for my kids or my husband is just carrots and peanut butter and then some grapes and there and then they'll grab that instead and then in this container what i've done my husband packs his lunch a lot now this is a beef roast there's some mac and cheese from the kids stuff and brussels sprouts so these are just braised he has his lunch already ready then for the next day by the way when i bring my fruits and vegetables home majority of the time i will cut up and sort them out i prepped them ahead of time so that way when i'm having a busy night which is most nights i can just grab everything it's already ready and it kind of stops me from using any kind of canned vegetables or box mix things because i already have it ready then so it's good to really cut up all your stuff and portion it out ahead of time that way you won't be tempted to grab a snack on the next shelf obviously is my milk my juices some water and then behind there i have some beef broth that i had from a roast and what i do is i save my beef broth because now i'm gonna make french onion soup with that save all your stuff now in this store this is only overflow of veggies that i did not prep yet you know my fridge is already packed so i didn't want to overload it and i just keep them in this drawer and lastly in this little guy so i have a bunch of littles littles or my kids and what's easy for them then is they can just come in here and if they want a materialistic it's right at their level all the snacks and things like that if you didn't see my target video go ahead and watch that you can get these for really really cheap with the ipod re be staying with these the fruit and chia they're really good and then i cut up some strawberries and then i put them in a little portion size for them to grab and i also have some sippie's here for them as well and yogurts so this is the kid drawer and they can just come in here it's so accessible it's so easy i love the concept you know the school year we don't always have time to be prepping as much as possible so it's nice to have some options for them to have a quick wrap and then of course it's your standard fridge there i keep some juices on the bottom creamers then it's just your standard you know what you can fit on each shelf in there i know a lot of people have those plastic bottles for their condiments that's their great - i was thinking about grabbing those i just haven't done that yet now for my freezer this is gonna be a little bit louder but this is what's going on here i keep on the top shelf these are strawberries from my garden and then mangoes that i got for really cheap at the store so what i did was i cut them up and froze them because i use these for smoothies i'll just grab a bag of mango throw yogurt and make a smoothie love it i always keep frozen water bottles in here right now though this is for the beach basically what i do is i put a ton of water bottles in our beach bag and then we have our and then we have our icy for the day like it'll keep it cold everything's good to go and by the end of the day all the bottles are moments you can drink them all in a ton of different snacks and especially ice cream products so in the summer time this shop is usually a mess so i thought to myself how can i make this organized and still let my kids get into their snacks without over packing the fridge either so what i did is this is a pullout bin i found this at target actually in the dollar spot i love this just so cool i put all of their popsicles and things like that in there and then in these guys from our chinese food containers when we order chinese food though i save them and then we put our our loose popsicles in there and then the luigi is here so they don't you know topple over and go everywhere i just love this concept this has worked so well for me i love it it's just great i don't keep a lot of stuff in our freezer upstairs because i just don't want to overload it but this is our like junky shelf and then down there is our meats and things on the show that's where i'll keep my hot dog if you guys have any questions feel free to ask let me know some of your mommy tips or just life chips in general and how you keep your fridge organized i love hearing that kind of stuff and how other people organize their fridge i just love it let me know in the comments if you guys do something similar like this for your kids where they just have a drawer that's right at their length and what do you put in your drawer what do you put in your kitchen right not yet part of team clean -

        "video_title": "How To Speed Up Your Metabolism Without Exercise (& Boost Thyroid Function!)",
        "video_sub_title": "- oftentimes when fitness trainers talk about metabolism and weight gain, they'll talk about how to improve your metabolic rate with exercise alone. what they don't tell you is that your metabolism is directly affected by your thyroid levels. if your metabolism is the engine, your thyroid is the gas. there's another way to speed up your metabolism with foods that boost thyroid function without exercise. yes, i said it, without exercise. it sounds to good to be true. i have proof from thousands of clients, so click the link below to find out more. ( upbeat music ) so let's just keep this very simple. what is metabolism? well, metabolism is the process it takes to keep you alive, how you burn calories, how you burn fat. the thing about metabolism is studies are coming out to let us know that we don't know as much as we thought we knew. we are learning more and more and more about metabolism all the time. it's constantly changing every minute of every day, always going up and down according to what you're eating, according to how you're sleeping, according to your hormones. metabolism is constantly being effected. one of the many myths about metabolism is that well, you gotta eat many meals a day to keep up your metabolism. well, that is actually doing you more harm than good. frequent eating, it trashes your system. it doesn't keep up your metabolism, so that's not something that we wanna use to help you. we can see that it doesn't help because we've been doing that for decades and we're the sickest and the fattest in human history, so that is not working for most people in this country. something that we need to understand is yes, metabolism goes down as we age, but that's not a bad thing. that is just part of the aging process. we can fight this with our diet, and when you get to goal weight you can start building muscle back up to help rev up your metabolism as well. again, keeping this simple, the thyroid effects metabolism because if you have a sluggish thyroid or if you have no thyroid, you're gonna have a difficult time losing weight. you gotta make sure you get those thyroid levels where they should be. this is something that your provider can help you with. i would prefer that you go to someone who specializes in this kind of thing, maybe a functional medicine provider or someone who really understands thyroid and how it relates to diet, but definitely the thyroid being wrong or off or having the levels be sluggish, you don't want that. that's gonna be a problem when you go to lose weight. i mean, not just weight loss, but having a sluggish thyroid and having your levels off, oh my gosh, i mean you just feel like crap, so getting your thyroid levels correct, you're gonna wanna definitely see somebody to help you with those levels. job one is getting your diet correct and this means a high - fat lifestyle. get that sugar down. get those crap carbs down out of the diet, and that's gonna put less pressure on your thyroid and that will help regulate thyroid levels. there's nothing you're gonna be able to do, there's no pill, there's no other method that's gonna be more powerful than getting your diet right. nothing else is gonna work if your diet is crap, so getting your diet right is gonna be job one. another thing that's gonna help your thyroid is supplementing iodine. you can talk to your provider about this. he or she will know more about this, but getting a good iodine supplement is gonna help that thyroid. if you're ready to join the masses of people who have lost weight and kept it off without exercise and were able to gain their life back and their health back along with new - found energy, i have a program for you. click the link below to access the code red 10 pound takedown challenge to get started. if you like this video, give me a thumbs up and better yet, subscribe to my channel. that way you are notified when i release a new video, but listen, i would love to hear from you, so comment below and tell me, how have you noticed your metabolism change since you've been on code red? i wanna hear your changes. put'em in the comment box and i'll see you in the next video.

        "video_sub_title": "in this video we will discuss the mechanisms for an acl tear described who may be at higher risk for an acl tear as well as provide screening techniques to assess your risk parents if you have children in youth or high school sports you will want to use the screening techniques in this section to assess your child's risk of tearing his or her acl the acl or anterior cruciate ligament is injured by one of the following mechanisms when pivoting and quickly changing directions the body rotates to the midline and with the foot staying planted an excessive rotational force happens at the knee the acl can also be injured with a combination of hyperextension and rotation of the body over it this usually happens when landing from a jump or trying to stop abruptly while running the foot plants but the momentum carries the body forward and rotates over the knee causing the acl to rupture the acl can also be injured by a direct blow to the knee but is frequently injured without contact we see non - contact injury commonly in basketball and soccer interestingly enough female athletes are more at risk for non - contact acl injuries than male athletes there is a plethora of research that demonstrates female soccer players are three to four times more likely to tear their acl than male soccer players and four to eight times more likely to tear their acl in basketball why is this there are several theories but the most credible theory is that males and females use their bodies differently men use their hips more when they squat notice how he comes down and he's got a nice hip angle as good forward bodily women use their quadriceps more that is they're more upright and use their hips less notice how upright she is she doesn't have as forward of a body lean as he had and is using her knees more fortunately research also demonstrates that female athletes can reduce the risk of acl injuries to similar rates of their male athlete counterparts with certain training programs research demonstrates a reduction of acl injuries by as much as 80 % after specific training programs geared toward correcting land mechanics while jumping and strengthening the hips whether you're a male or a female athlete a quick self - assessment can be performed to gauge your risk or the risk of your child let's look at the single leg squat a proper squat should maintain the knee in alignment with the ankle and the hip if the knee comes in word during this squat then it tells us that the hip is not strong enough to control the femur remember one mechanism of the acl injury is the knee coming inward and excessive rotation if she cuts out of this position she is at risk for tearing her acl next let's look at the step down attempt a slow controlled step down leaving one foot on the box and lowering the other leg again we look to see if the alignment of the knee ankle and hip can be maintained if the knee travels inward she is at risk finally try a drop jump jump down off the box and land on both legs if the natural landing technique is to remain upright and not then the knees and hips as much then she is at risk from the side notice how upright she is and how little bend she has in her hips and her knees we want to get her lower when she land if the knees come inward during the landing she's at risk for an acl tear the goal is to land with a neutral alignment with the hips knee and ankles in line and absorbing the shock by flexing the knees and the hips from the side you can see that when she lands her hips and knees flex more thus she is less vulnerable to tearing her acl if one of these tests is positive you may be at risk for injuring your acl call our office and set up a free consultation with one of our physical therapists who specialize in sports medicine an injury prevention program can be created to reduce your risk of injury you",

        "video_sub_title": "you think you have a yeast infection and want to know how to effectively treat it keep watching this video i'm going to talk about the symptoms of a yeast infection and how to get rid of it [ music ] welcome to my channel my name is diana and i'm a physician assistant specializing in women's health and gynecology you are watching in the pink and in case you are wondering in the pink actually means in good health and wellness which is what my channel is all about specifically for women and girls so if you want a resource for information about birth control menopause and hot flashes breast problems utis cancer symptoms and so much more give this video a thumbs up and hit subscribe so you don't miss any videos just like this one all right now that intros are out of the way let's get down to business and talk about yeast infections so yeast infections this is one of the most common causes of vaginal itching and discharge if you've had a yeast infection you know what i'm talking about it's itchy and it's bernie and it's got discharge and if you have it all you can think of is how to get rid of it and fast now be sure to watch this video to the very end because at the end i'm going to talk about the circumstances where you shouldn't try to treat a yeast infection on your own or rather you should go into your medical provider to be treated so watch for that at the end so yeast infections are very common and very annoying problem for many women it's often officially diagnosed at your medical providers office there you can be prescribed oral or vaginal medication that can quickly treat your infection however many women choose to diagnose and treat their symptoms on their own and i think this is okay to do especially if you've been diagnosed with yeast infections before and you know what they feel like and what they look like if you decide to treat a yeast infection on your own there are some important things to know first of all yeast infections are commonly caused by an organism called canada and it is the second most common cause of vaginitis second only to bacterial vaginosis second up to twenty five percent of women have candida yeast in their vagina already as part of their normal flora which means normal vaginal microorganisms that always live in your vagina yeast infections only need to be treated if there are symptoms symptoms of yeast infections include burning and itching within the vagina or the vulva which is also called the vaginal lips pain with sex pain when you urinate or pee or vaginal discharge vaginal discharge in itself doesn't always mean there's a problem most women have vaginal discharge every day and if you're wondering if your vaginal discharge is just normal or if it could be an infection watch my video that talks about what normal vaginal discharge looks and smells like and i put a link to that video in my video description third there's actually something that you can do at home that takes much of the guesswork out of self diagnosing and treating a yeast infection so how do we do this what you can do is check your vaginal ph checking the vaginal ph is exactly what i do in my office when i'm looking to diagnose somebody with vaginal symptoms now in order to understand this let's talk about vaginal ph so ph test checks for acidity and alkalinity so a healthy vagina typically has a lower ph if there's no infection or if there's a yeast infection but out of there common infections like bacterial vaginosis for example increases your vaginal ph so if you are having symptoms of an infection and your vaginal ph is low then it's more likely that your symptoms could be from a yeast infection but if you're having vaginal symptoms and your ph is high it could be from a different type of infection and if that happens and you should get your symptoms check it out by your medical provider now here's the tricky part there's nothing in the rule book that says you can't have two infections at one time right in fact up to half of women who have a yeast infection have a second type of infection as well so even if the ph test is high and you really think that you have a yeast infection because you had it before and you know what it feels like you can still buy the over - the - counter cream that treats youth's infections but you should still get checked out by your medical provider just to make sure something else isn't going on like a secondary infection now i know that there are tons of home remedies out there that you can try to treat your yeast infection as yourself and i'm not bashing them at all just know that lots of these treatments haven't been effectively studied so be careful and use your common sense if you're gonna try any of those but if you want to treat your yeast infection with something that has been well studied and shown to be effective in treating yeast infections i would stick with what you can purchase when you go to the pharmacy in the over - the - counter section they have recently come up with an over - the - counter yeast infection cream that also includes the ph test i think that's a great option because you can check out what your vaginal pee before you try the cream this is good especially if you just aren't sure if you have a yeast infection or if you have something else so i will put a link to that in the video description down below now there are some circumstances when you should see a medical provider rather than treating a yeast infection yourself if you have tried it over - the - counter cream and it didn't help if you've had more than three infections in a year if your symptoms are severe not just mild moderate but really bad or if you have a medical condition that makes it harder for your body to fight infections like hiv or diabetes or if you're pregnant thanks for watching my video on how to effectively treat a yeast infection i hope that you found it informative next week's video is gonna be on the easy and natural ways you can prevent yeast infections so hit subscribe so you don't miss that video also hit the like button and the notification valve so that you won't miss any future videos so the question that i have for you is do you have ways that you treat or prevent your yeast infections that you have found effective put that in the comment section below i'd love to read all about it just as a reminder this video is intended to be educational and informative but it is not intended to diagnose or treat you so if you have any medical symptoms that you're concerned about be sure to have that checked out by your own provider thanks for watching we'll see you next time",

        "video_sub_title": "did you lose your sense of smell you're likely having covid - 19 right now are there any other causes of a loss of smell and taste other than covid - 19 i am dr. omar danoun a neurologist and i will answer all of those questions and at the end of the video i will give you a recipe to restore your sense of taste and smell without any medications and something that you can use at your home what is the percentage of patients who lose their sense of smell after covid - 19 the answer is, can vary from one area of the world to another and it ranges between 30 in some areas and reaches up to 87 percent in others and the lack of smell can be the first sign of covid - 19 and sometimes can be the only sign that a patient can suffer from how does the covid - 19 virus affect the sense of smell it mostly attacks the cells in the nose that support the nerve cells and these cells are supportive and make an environment for the nerve cells to function and analyze the smell and the virus damage those cells and cause the loss of smell so when those cells come back the sense of smell usually comes back what are the consequences of lack of smell and taste on that daily living so usually when patients lose their ability to smell and taste food they become less interested in food and they will be loss of appetite and they don't eat and that will affect their recovery and sometimes the food test and smell changes so you become aversive to that food and and to eating also there is some safety measures that are affected by the lack of smell so sometimes people could not sense and smell some dangerous things in the environment like if there is a gas leak you will not be able to smell it and sometimes you can eat a a bad food that you could not recognize that this food is bad are there any other causes of loss of smell than covid - 19 now because of the of the mass and increased numbers of covid - 19 most common cause of lack of smell is covered 19 however there are lots of other causes that can cause loss of taste and smell and they can be serious in some time also there are sometimes there are brain tumors that can cause lack of smell so if you do have lack of smell that is not improving or you're tested negative for covid - 19 you should see your doctor to make sure that you don't have any other illnesses or condition that affected your smell and now how can you treat your lack of smell and taste the good news is that about 90 percent of patients will get their sense of taste and smell within one week to four weeks of the infection and please let me know in the comments how long it took you to recover from your lack of smell and taste and then you can take some supplements like zinc 50 milligrams daily and vitamin b12 however you should be careful with taking too much zinc as we explained in other videos and now there is a training that you can do at home it's called olfactory training and this is a training of the nerves like physical therapy but for your sense of smell so the first step is that you want to identify four strong odors like you can use lemon you can use oregano you can use onions you can use fruits you can use even essential oils and the instructions are first you take the smell you take the object that you want to smell and put it in your nose and make a small sniffs and do that for 20 seconds and then let your nose rest for about one minute and then go to the next container and start smelling it for 20 seconds and then wait for one minute and go to the third and then the fourth one and i want you to do this for twice a day in the morning and at night and then do that for two to three months to get a full recovery of your of your sense of smell and taste thank you so much for watching if you like this video make sure to subscribe to my channel to stay up to date on weekly videos about the brain and nerves",

androgens can cause birth defects. for this reason, this medication is often paired with oral contraceptives to prevent pregnancy. if you become pregnant, you will likely need to try other treatments like diet or lifestyle changes. add high - fiber, low - fat foods to your diet. foods high in fiber can help you to maintain healthy weight and ensure you are getting enough fiber in your diet from vegetables and fruits. go for meals packed with fresh fruits or vegetables as well as healthy sources of protein like chicken, tofu, and beans. keep your meals low in fat so you can keep your insulin levels low and maintain healthy weight. make meal plan and go shopping at the start of the week so you have ingredients on hand to prepare meals. go for foods rich in omega -

        "video_sub_title": "hi guys how are you i am tina from mecca wearables and today we're going to create an upside - down tuxedo braid bun i saw this braid on cute girls hairstyles channel and thought how cute opie if we turned it into a bun style so here we go first we're going to apply some hair wax all over our hair to make the grading easier and then we're going to create a square section to form a high ponytail before clipping it out of the way next we're gonna section out the sides but after filming this part i decided to make a size section little thicker so clip up slightly more than what you see here and if you're doing this on yourself clip away really tightly so that no hair is falling out and getting in your way alright and then we're going to flip our head upside down to start a tight dutch braid towards the ponytail and i know this is going to be hard for you guys to see but basically in a dutch braid you add in hair to these size strength before crossing them under the middle strand so you're just doing a regular braid after adding in hair right so you add in hair some leba so you adding some hair from the left side to the left strand and cross it under and add in some hair from the right side to the right strand and cross it under and so on and we're going to take thin sections in the beginning so the braid will pop more and only pull out the sides of the braid to make a thicker from middle up so we want the front part to be tightly braided and when you get to the ponytail we're going to incorporate the braid with the ponytail and again clip it out of the way and then we're going to make a loose french braid but make sure the braid starts on the middle up so the bottom braid the dutch braid i'm talking about is showing through and to start this braid we're going to take a small section from each side and then to form our third strand we're going to take a small piece from each of them all right and now that we have three strands you can start your french braid and i try doing this part for you guys upside down as well but it made me so lightheaded and nauseous while filming so i'm going to do it sitting up here my hair is going to fall over the braid so again it's going to be hard to see so i'll link below another french braid for you guys if you don't know how to french braid okay but basically to french braid your hair you incorporate sections like we did before but this time you're going to cross it over the middle strand and i started with small sections and made it thicker as i got closer to the ponytail to create this beautiful braid texture and in total i did four sections from each side but this will depend on how thick your hair is okay once you get to the ponytail tie the braid and use some hairspray to control the flyaways and then incorporate it with the ponytail before removing all the elastic bands used on the braid and then we're going to make our bun and you can do any kind of bun for this but i like to just twist the ends talked on the sides to make it thicker before wrapping it around the self to form a messy bun i first use a hair tie to secure it and then a few bobby pins to secure the sides to create a messy round shape then i just hung on the sides to make it more messy or pin it down if it just is too crazy and messy looking and as for the back i wanted to tuxedo braid part to be more noticeable so i use one bobby pin to raise the second braid up higher and as for the sides if you see any line meaning your skin showing then all you need to do is make the hair around the area that your skin is showing looser by talking on it and we're done i hope you guys liked today's hairstyle don't forget to like and subscribe for more to care tutorials on saturdays i love you guys have a beautiful day everyone bye",

        "video_title": "10 Bad Foods for Your Lungs (Avoid with Asthma and COPD)",
        "video_sub_title": "[ music ] the lungs aren't essential organ for human life because they are constantly working to bring in oxygen and remove carbon dioxide that is why if you truly want to improve your overall health it's important to take good care of your respiratory system and one way to do so is to monitor the foods that you consume in your diet unfortunately many of the foods that we eat are actually very bad for the health of our lungs and that is exactly what we're going to talk about in this video be sure to hang around until the end because there's one food that almost everyone eats that is actually very very bad for the health of your lungs so if you're ready let's get into it the first food that we should mention is white bread white bread has become a staple of the diets of hundreds of thousands of people and unfortunately white bread isn't good because when it's broken down into its refined condition it turns into a simple carbohydrate this basically means that it has had most of its nutrients dripped away simple carbohydrates not only have significantly less nutritional value they can lead to an increased inflammatory response as well increased inflammation makes it more difficult for blood to flow throughout the body this is significant because that is how oxygen is transported throughout the body via red blood cells the lack of blood flow can increase the amount of stress that is placed on your heart and lungs so instead of white bread and refined carbohydrates you can opt for whole wheat and whole grains instead the next food that isn't good for your lungs is processed meat the purpose of processing meat is to prolong the shelf life and or to improve the taste but to do so companies load the meats up with sodium compounds called nitrites nitrites are reportedly not supposed to be harmful to our bodies however some studies suggest that they ultimately could lead to certain types of cancer also increased amounts of sodium can increase the body's inflammatory response and as we discussed this puts more stress on the heart and lungs some of the most common examples include hot dogs ham bologna salami and canned meats i get it we all like to enjoy a tasty hot dog every once in a while just try to do it in moderation next we need to talk about burgers some studies found that eating burgers can increase the occurrence of wheezing in people with asthma if they eat more than one per week there are a couple of reasons that burgers can affect breathing first they are often made with processed meat which we just touched on secondly burgers are high in saturated fat content especially ones from fast food restaurants studies found that diets high in saturated fat can exacerbate symptoms related to copd and asthma now again i'm not suggesting that you should never eat another hamburger but if you do have asthma or other breathing related conditions it may be worth considering next up is whole milk whole milk and other dairy products in general have been shown to have negative impacts on the respiratory system through the process of breaking down the components found in dairy products it results in an increased production of mucus an increased buildup of mucus in the lungs has all sorts of detrimental effects including difficulty breathing decreased oxygenation and an increased risk of a lung infection if possible try to opt for an alternative to whole milk such as almond or coconut milk the next food that we need to discuss may shock you and it is broccoli broccoli in and of itself is not an unhealthy food in fact broccoli is loaded with tons of nutritional ingredients the only downside is as it's broken down during digestion it gives you gas and too much trapped gas in the body has an indirect effect on the lungs because it can limit the space in the thoracic cavity which means that the lungs don't have as much room to expand this results in smaller inhaled tidal volumes which means your body isn't getting the full amount of oxygen that it needs moving right along the next food that we should mention is salt salt or sodium is found in almost every food that we eat it's important to know that sodium isn't always bad in fact sodium is necessary for our bodies to function properly with that said too much salt intake causes dehydration and leads to inflammation in the body and as we touched on earlier this leads to increased stress on the respiratory system so if you have an underlying respiratory condition or illness that affects the respiratory system you should definitely monitor your sodium intake and keep it limited next up is soda sodas are potentially bad for your lungs for three reasons first they're loaded with sugar second they contain carbonation and third they contain caffeine drinking soda over time can lead to tooth decay which causes increased bacteria in the mouth to form this can lead to increased acidity in the body which can inadvertently affect the ventilatory response of the lungs carbonation can lead to heartburn which leaves a painful sensation in your chest and can affect your breathing and caffeine can cause an increased heart rate and blood pressure which makes the heart and lungs work harder than normal all in all try to drink a lot of water and limit the amounts of sodas that you consume the next food that negatively affects your lungs is fried foods let's face it fried foods are delicious that explains why they are so heavily consumed by most people unfortunately there are several reasons why fried foods are bad for the cardiopulmonary system and i'll touch on a few of them for starters the oil that the food is fried in is usually extremely high in saturated fats which can put a strain on both the lungs and cardiovascular system also most fried foods are breaded which means that they contain simple carbohydrates which leads to inflammation as previously mentioned and most importantly fried foods are extremely high in calories which ultimately leads to gaining weight and as you know obesity puts a strain on the lungs and makes it more difficult to breathe it also increases the risk of a heart attack as well so do your heart lungs and waistline a favor and limit the amount of fried shoes that you eat so moving right along and this one may surprise you but the next one that we need to talk about is coffee if you're like me and i hate to admit it you're probably very reliant on drinking coffee the first thing i do every morning after rolling out of bed is fix a nice warm cup of dark roast coffee it's delicious and it gives me a much needed energy boost unfortunately a recent study found that the overconsumption of coffee has been linked to lung cancer in both smoking and non - smoking individuals the cause is unknown at this time and more research is needed in this area but this did come as a surprise to me when i learned about the study in general as long as you don't overdo it drinking coffee in moderation is probably okay now that i mention it most things are most likely okay in moderation but to be safe try to limit your coffee consumption to 2 cups or less per day real quick guys do me a huge favor and hit the like button it really helps support the channel and i greatly greatly appreciate it and while you're down there go ahead and click the subscribe

        "video_sub_title": "what's up guys? jeff cavaliere, athleanx. com. so rotator cuff exercises, by now you should know how important they are. if your watching our channel for any length of time, you realize how important they are. you see, most poorly written workout programs have such an imbalance between the number of exercises that internally rotate our shoulders versus those that externally rotate our shoulders, there's no surprise that we're winding up with so many guys that wind up with shoulder pain from working out. but it doesn't have to be that way. but if you understand that you have to do your shoulder external rotation exercises, that's only half the battle. you see because a lot of times, what we're doing is we're doing them wrong. see there's three big mistakes that people will make when they're doing the rotator cuff exercises, or externally rotating exercises. and i think we need to address them here today so that we're making sure that you are not. you see the first is, when we do our external rotation, you have to make sure that you're really keeping your elbow tucked tight to your side. as tight as you possibly can. if you have to, you put a towel up under your arm to reinforce that. now why the towel? because the mistake is, when people go do this, they try to cheat and get a little bit more room and a little bit more motion, so they let their elbow drift away from their body. and what's happening here is, they're not using their rotator cuff in isolation any more. now they're using their deltoid in addition to their external rotation and a lot of times what will happen is, the deltoid will take over and dominate. so it becomes more of a side lateral raise. the towel will drop on the floor the minute you do that though. that's why it's a good idea to have it as a visual feedback. the reason why that's a problem is, the rotator cuff in general is supposed to keep the heavy humerus centered inside of the glenoid. so inside the ball and socket you're supposed to have a centrally located ball. as you raise your arm up, whether it be through an overhead press or a side lateral raise or a front dumbbell raise, that head needs to stay in the middle of the joint, so that you don't get a migration upwards that can cause a banging into the roof of the acromion there, and a pinching of that rotator cuff tendon, which will lead to that impingement. if you have the deltoid doing all the work, all your doing is contributing more and more to the problem because the deltoid in the first place wants to pull the head of the humerus up. the only muscles we have that counteract that upward pull and keep it centrally located, are those boring old, three little rotator cuff muscles. so let them do the job in the first place. let them actually work. the second mistake that we have to consider and fix, is the position that we have with our upper body when we do the exercises. you see any external rotation exercise is great but not if you're doing it at a piss poor posture. you see if you have rounded shoulders like this, you've just completely negated all the freedom you're trying to create by keeping the balance and strength in the rotator cuff muscles in the first place. see try this quick test with me. get yourself into bad posture. allow your shoulders to round forward, let your shoulder blades round, protract around your body. get your shoulders rounded forward, exaggerate. now take your arm and try to raise it as high as you possibly can. this is it, this is as far as i can go before it mechanically gets blocked. it's literally hitting the roof of the acromion here, inside my shoulder joint. now if i put my shoulder blades in your back pocket, all things will change. now by just setting my shoulder blades, like i said, down and back. you just want to let them be tight up against your rib cage. when i do that, now i raise my arm up i've got way more freedom. because i actually allowed the roof that was leaning forward here and blocking the head of the humerus to now sit back, so now that humerus can come up and actually move freely inside that socket. the third and final mistake is actually related to the second one, and that is an inattention to the other half of the equation here. what is the actual shoulder blade doing? we just covered how important the position of the shoulder blade is to the overall function of the shoulder joint, so if you're not worried about the position of your shoulder blade at any point in time, then you're really ignoring a main key component of the goal of your shoulder external rotation exercises. so, we need to fix that. we need to realize that two muscles will actually really position the shoulder blade where we want it to be, that down into your back pocket position. that's going to be your serratus anterior and your lower trap. we can actually train these two muscles very, very easily. and with very little extra work in your workout. here i'm demonstrating a plank plus. and it's actually done with a slight tweak. i have my arms, my forearms on the ground and i have them palms up, with my shoulders and elbows in and my hands and forearms out a little bit, to get a little external rotation into my shoulders. and from here, i'm trying to just push my body away from my arms, keeping everything nice and tight and fixed. we're getting a protraction of the shoulder blades around my body and i'm just trying to push away, but again leave everything nice and tight and stable. the serratus anterior is what's getting the focus of that work there and it's trying to hold the shoulder blade nice and tight here, as you can see on our skeleton. nice and tight for the rib cage, because you need that stability down. the second thing we need to do is to work on the lower traps so that we can get the proper rotation of the shoulder blades, because when we raise our arm up, there's a huge amount of rotation that's needed by the shoulder blade to do that. if your shoulder blades stay fixed, you'd only get your arm up about two thirds of the way. so you need to make sure that you're getting the rotation of the shoulder blades and it has to stay tight to your rib cage. so you can do some of the exercises i'm showing you here. the first can actually be done in two different ways, either using the bar or using equipment. but it's the same goal here. you can see me hanging from a pull up bar, it's that natural upper rotation that's occurring here from the pull up position right as i had my arms up and hanging over my body. but i want to just try to pull my body up without allowing my elbows to bend. but now we're getting in control and contribution from the lower traps to help develop some strength and stability into the scapular component of back lateral humeral joint. and i can do the same thing with a cable, like a lat pull down setup, where i'm just trying to do that real bottom position there and keeping my arms straight the whole time. you don't have to do a lot of these guys, you've just go to make sure you're doing them right and you're allowing the right muscles to do the work. and that's what it is guys, it's not about doing a whole lot extra. matter of fact, we have ways that we combine the rotator cuff into the exercises that we normally do. we realize that this big over reliance on internal rotation in most programs is not going to cut it. and that's why as a physical therapist, i've put together the athleanx training system. so it's not just about getting you big and strong, we'll do that, i promise you. but we'll also do it in a way that we protect your joints and help you get there safely. guys, if you're looking for a program to build muscle but at the same time, realize and respect the longevity that comes with it so we can actually do this for a long time. then head to athleanx. com and get our athleanx training system. in the meantime if you found this video helpful, make sure you leave your comments and thumbs up below and we'll keep making them. alright guys, we'll be back here again in just a few days.",

        "video_sub_title": "[ music ] it gives us a good idea of what folliculitis quick you latest videos forum but whatever i'm not going to bet anymore hi guys welcome back we have a special surprise for you this is a derma axe video it's a little bit different than our typical ones because you know we're in this situation but today i have joining me dr. nina decides she's a board - certified dermatologist in manhattan beach california and i'm so excited that we're making this work hello nina hi how are you i'm so excited to be here too i know it's been you know difficult not being able to be together but i'm excited we're doing this me too and if you guys don't know we're like facetiming each other and then recording our own videos at the same time it's really funny today's topic is a really important one because we have been getting asked questions about this all the time it's fungal acne this is probably something that i think over the past year especially has really come up as a big topic people talk about it and our facebook group people talk about it you know when we get our videos that people want us to react to and stuff and i thought that this was a really important topic to do with a dermatologist because fungal acne is a tricky one i feel like i never used to hear about it and then suddenly in the past year it just became a big topic so i wanted to hear what nina has to say about it so need a first off tell us what is fungal acne okay so fungal acne is neither an acne nor a fungus so it's this kind of made - up name for a condition that as dermatologists call malassezia or pittosporum folliculitis it is a yeast build - up that occurs on the skin so it's not a fungus it's actually eased and it's a very different picture than a traditional acne picture the triggers can be different and it can look different and the treatments can be different yeah so when people say fungal acne where do you think that they got this from is it because it kind of looks like acne i think it can look like acne and oftentimes it's mistaken for acne and sometimes people come to the dermatologist because they've tried to treat it like regular acne and it's not getting better and that's how they kind of present they say hey i have this acne that's just not getting better with like the over - the - counter acne products and it's called a fungus because the malassezia or the yeast is in the same biological classification as a yeast or fungus would be but it's actually different this is a yeast that probably just grows on our skin naturally yes so the malassezia east does grow on our skin naturally it can cause other conditions a condition called seborrhoeic dermatitis or tinea versicolor those are other conditions that the malassezia east can actually cause and it over grows on the skin in certain conditions to cause this you know fungal acne or pit arose for m - type picture but does it show up the way acne does like if we see do we see it like on the cheek area on the forehead all over the body what where do we see this typically malassezia or pittosporum folliculitis is gonna occur in slightly different areas than traditional acne typically you're gonna see it on the shoulders or the back or the chest if we do see it on the face oftentimes you kind of see it on the forehead or around you know the hairline we're sweat tends to build up so those are typically the areas where you're gonna see this type of pit arose for them so does it end up looking like acne in the sense of like is it like little red bumps or does it tend to look more like clogged pores like whiteheads it can look like little red bumps or clogged pores but typically those clogged pores don't really come to a head like a real whitehead would they tend to occur in crops more often so you'll see little groups of them in the areas where you get them and they tend to look deeper because the pittosporum actually affects the hair follicle so whereas some acne yona looks like you can squeeze it and you can get that whitehead out the pit row spore in folliculitis actually looks like more stuff or deeper under the skin because of the location where the yeast is all right so we're gonna take a look at a few pictures but before we do i just want to let you guys know we're actually gonna tell you how to treat fungal acne videos forum folliculitis but we're gonna look at some pictures of what it could be first we're showing you this so you have more information but at the end of the day you should definitely see a dermatologist so dr. desai i want you to take a look at this on first this is saline she has what i actually think a lot of people tend to is fungal acne what do you see with these pictures so when i look at saline i'm not really convinced that she's got peter osborne folliculitis at all because what i see is a lot of clogging around her mouth area i see these whiteheads that are really too ahead and that tends to be more typical of an acne type bacterial infection so i actually think that she's in that category more so the fact that it's really distributed around her chin and her jaw line she may have some component of hormonal acne if you look at her skin there is some old scarring and some old hyperpigmentation which tells me that she may have had some cysts or some papules or pustules that are much more typical of an acne picture whether it's hormonal or not so i actually would ask her those questions and kind of talk to her about the cyclical nature of her acne and try to get a feel for if we think this might be hormonal acne as opposed to pateros form folliculitis we're saying from pictures we're assuming it's not yeah from these pictures yeah i would actually love to ask her what product she uses on her face if she's using makeup brushes or sponges and how often she cleans them a lot of the pustules that she has around her face oftentimes is typical of a little bacterial buildup on the face so i'm really curious as to what she's putting on her face alright so next up we have emily from our group and she thinks that she has some fungal acne happening on this side of her face what do you think so i don't think emily has fungal acne either so if you look at her face what you're seeing is a mix of whiteheads and blackheads which are very typical of regular acne and you see this larger pustule that pustule again it's very much to a head that's very typical of a bacterial acne i think she would do really well with something like a retinol or retinol out those blackheads in those whiteheads and then something with a topical antibiotic component to it to calm down the pustular acne that she has all right so this next one is actually part of the body which i think is going to tell us a lot about what this is just from what you've been telling us so far what do you think about this picture yeah so i do think that this picture is pretty clear for pateros form folliculitis if you notice we're looking the chest that's a really common area where you get this east overgrowth because that tends to be an area where we really sweat and our sweat gets you know kind of stuck or occluded underneath our clothing so this is a very typical picture it's red it's bumpy you can tell that those areas look kind of deep i would not be surprised if this patient tells you that she's itching so this is a really good example of pedro's form folliculitis all right so dr. decide this one is very hard for me because i look at this and and i'm really not sure because you also said that it can appear on the body mostly so i'm looking at this and i'm kind of unsure of what this might be yeah so this one is a tricky one and it is something that might actually be a mixed picture because what can happen with individuals who have all these tiny little bumps or these tiny little clogs she might have both a bacterial and a yeast buildup so i have a couple more questions for her i really want to see what's going on on her chest on her back i'd want to talk to her about what products she's using i want to talk to her about how much she sweats things like that to kind of feel out what might be triggering this deep bumps for her you can have a combination of problems happening then you can you can it's not very typical but some individuals can i think sometimes we're so definitive about what we have happening but sometimes it's a combination of problems yeah it can be not always but it can be and i think typically the acne component of it always gets better faster because people go out and they try the over - the - counter acne products and that component of it may get better but the yeast component of it really doesn't go anywhere until you really diagnose that okay there's a yeast going on and we treat it with the appropriate medications so this patient actually might have a mixed picture and after asking her those questions and kind of seeing what she may have tried in the past we can kind of get a better idea of if she has a mixed picture and how we should go about treating it i've seen in our private facebook group people have been asking if ingredients like hyaluronic acid can cause fungal acne so i'm wondering you know if you have any answers to something like that yeah so there's no evidence to show that the ingredient itself hyaluronic acid or any other ingredients themselves can cause fungal acne but what can happen is if someone's using a product that's kind of heavy or thick and occlusive in nature and some products may have hyaluronic acid in it or they may have heavier oils in it or occlusive moisturizers that can create an environment in which the yeast can grow because you're causing this clogging of the skin so that can create an environment in which typical acne can grow too so that's something to distinguish whether it's from a product that you're using not the product itself but from the environment that the product is creating on your skin so while some of these occlusive ingredients might be great for someone they can also be terrible for someone else essentially what you're saying yes and that's why history and getting a really detailed account of what someone's using is really important to their diagnosis yeah and i would actually say helena cassadine on an occlusive ingredient like you said it's it's really what mixture it is yes exactly what formula right exactly it's all about the formula here's another one that might be tricky and i'm curious to see what it is that you're gonna say about this yeah so when i look at her i do see these deep bumps that may be reminiscent of a pitter osborne folliculitis but i also see some irritation and some redness and some scaling on her skin so those all could be typical findings that you would find in a hetero swaram or a yeast build - up but i also kind of want to know what she's using on her skin to make sure that some of her products aren't irritating her skin and actually contributing to this bumpy picture that she has because of that redness and that dryness and that scaling that i see those are gonna be really important questions for her to figure out if she may not have a dermatitis actually going on so you're saying it could be dermatitis potentially or it could be the pity of spore on folliculitis my bets on dermatitis or her though given the redness that i see oh you're thinking it's the dermatitis i do yeah but this is why it's important to see a dermatologist it is it's really important and i'd love to look at the rest of her too because sometimes what's going on on one part of your body really helps you make the diagnosis about what's going on everywhere this diagnosis goats missed all the time by people because they're not really think about a yeast buildup on their skin they're thinking about a traditional acne that you know looks like these bumps on the skin sometimes the causes can be similar you know oil build - up or clogging of the skin can contribute to it so they're really not thinking about the easte build - up so that's why it's so often an individual does not come in think hey i think i have peter osborne folliculitis but they'll come and say i have this acne and it just won't go away that type of acne you know the pateros form folliculitis tends to be a little bit more itchy tends to be very resistant to you know over - the - counter topical acne treatments but it's not really something that someone would be able to self diagnose so we've gotten a good idea of what it looks like it what it might not look like or what could kind of walk the line so hearing you talk about this though it makes me wonder is this sort of like a yeast infection is that tmi tasks not at all actually it really is so the yeast is a little different than obviously a vaginal yeast infection that you would get but what's happening is this east naturally lives on our skin and then in the wrong environment it tends to over grow and one of the things that these two yeast infections do have in common is something like the use of an antibiotic so when you take an antibiotic for you know a bacterial infection it changes the body's flora and it changes the yeast flora as well so what's happening is the yeast then can proliferate or over grow similar to the way individuals who take antibiotics for longer periods of time can develop that vaginal yeast infection so there is a similarity between the two so when you're getting your antibiotics and asking for the diflucan prescription you have to keep that you have to keep your skin in mind - yeah absolutely you do you do everyone sensitivities are different but it is a question that i asked when i see this in the office i've seen a few people ask the following questions also one if certain ethnicities tend to get this and also if the climate that you live in can affect whether you get it or not so no not really but climate absolutely so those that live in a very hot or humid climate are gonna be more susceptible to this is that you know we're at the beach all the time again the individuals that are more susceptible to it when you are sweating more when it is hot when it is more humid that's the environment in which the yeast is going to overgrow you know i have a question since you know obviously it's called fungal acne or it you know the nickname is fungal acne and it the reason is because it tends to look like acne can you actually squeeze anything out the way you could with young acne so these bumps do tend to appear deeper you can you know if someone's aggressive they can really get at them and you can get some of that oil clog out some of that needs to build up out i typically don't recommend doing that because it can be deeper and you can end up you know with some hyperpigmentation or scarring the skin so i never recommend going after your own yeast build - up or acne on your own so then what would be the treatment for this first line treatments what you want to do is you want to pick something that has anti yeast or antifungal properties to it you can start with something super simple like an over - the - counter dandruff shampoo dandruff shampoos tend to be antifungal whether you're looking at something like a nice drawl that has ketoconazole in it if you're looking at some sort of cells in blue that has selenium sulfide in it those tend to have the properties to kill this east so what i typically recommend is using those dandruff shampoos as a wash so the affected areas you lather the shampoo on you make a good nice lather and you leave it on for about five minutes before you rinse it off and you do that you don't have to do it every single time you wash but i typically recommend doing it at least two to three times a week and after you've cleared the pit row spoor and build up you want to do it as like a maintenance to to prevent the yeast from building up again but sometimes the pinterest forum is deep and it won't respond to the topical agents so starting with that topical agent using some kind of a dandruff shampoo like a nizoral you're gonna apply it just like you would your cleanser and then after that can you go into your normal skin care routine or what would you recommend yeah so after you've washed it off you definitely can use your normal skin care routine again the things that you want to look out for our products that may make that environment more pleasant for the east so you want to kind of avoid those thicker heavier greasy er products something that doesn't you know kind of clog the pores so avoid those products when you're treating these to build up because you just don't want to kind of create that environment for it but other than that yes you can use your normal skincare routine okay so then you can use all of your actives and everything you're just saying don't put on the heavier creams almost treat your skin like you might like oily skin absolutely yeah because some of the you know kind of actives are gonna help brighten the skin they're gonna help you know cell turnover things like that if you're using your retina or your retinol all of that is gonna help the skin it's not gonna harm the fungal acne it's not gonna treat it but it's not gonna harm it well using one of these types of dandruff shampoos dry your skin out or harm it in any way so you may feel a little bit more dry after using the dandruff shampoos that can happen but again you want to hydrate the skin and again if you picked like an oil - free or a lighter moisturizer to hydrate with then i think you'll be okay i saw somebody say that they actually used an athlete's foot spray for this which do you think that that's something that they can do as well same concept yes the athlete athlete's feet spray has an antifungal property to it so that's what's actually killing the yeast so actually the same concept so oftentimes someone will grab like a pusher missile or a terbinafine which are the over - the - counter antifungal topicals that you can get and that will work it will work for some cases for the milder cases it will work but then you said sometimes it can be a little resistant to using a shampoo like this or an antifungal spray what we then recommend yeah so that can actually happen quite often so after a couple of weeks of using either a topical antifungal cream or a damn dry shampoo if this is really not improving you do want to see your dermatologist because the bitterest form folliculitis or the yeast can live in the hair follicle so it can be deep and in that case what we want to do is we want to get you on an oral antifungal those really do work for the treatment of resistant pittosporum all right so i think we've covered a lot of this is there anything else that you think we should cover one thing i do want individuals who think they may be suffering with this to know is that there definitely is treatment for it it can be really stubborn and it can be really resistant that's why if you've tried over - the - counter acne products if you even tried over - the - counter you know anti yeast products and you're still not getting anywhere definitely go see your autologous because we treat this all the time i treat this all the time it does really respond to the correct treatment so don't lose hope we can absolutely treat it this might even be easier to treat then typical ask me then sometimes it is the issue with this is that it does tend to recur so that's some an important thing to note as well so while we can treat it once you do get it you are more susceptible to it recurring or coming back again because as i said this malassezia used it lives on the skin naturally and when you know your body creates those environments for it to grow it tends to happen again so just know that this may be something that's going to require some maintenance once you see it again you'll know okay it's cropping up again and we'll treat it again so just know you know you might have to have some maintenance involved all right good to know well thank you so much dr desai i'm so glad we got to make this video work we had so many videos scheduled and planned to shoot so i'm glad that we're actually getting some of them done seem thank you so much susan for having me on it was just so much fun and i'm so glad we got to do this me too thank you so much you guys ask us questions in the comments below find us both on instagram i'll put our handles here on the screen and we will talk to you soon bye [ music ] [ applause ]",

        "video_title": "What Causes High Estrogen In Men.",
        "video_sub_title": "hello everyone this dr. chauhan in this video i'm going to talk about high estrogen levels in men now men we do have estrogen i always say it's like the 80 / 20 rule we have 80 % testosterone 20 % estrogen and as we age our testosterone levels decrease which in turn our estrogen levels increase this is why as men get older they slow their they have a lower libido they get a higher voice so forth and so on however a lot of times men are hitting that that part sooner now estrogen is not bad for us it does serve purposes a couple of one it regulates testosterone it's good for skin health it helps control our sexual function and libido it's good for our brain it's good for our bone health it's good for heart function also too it's good for cholesterol regulation okay so again estrogen is not bad for us it's just that if you have too much of it too soon it can be again hurt your health so what are some high estrogen symptoms some high - end estrogen symptoms in no particular order but sexual dysfunction what happens if a man has too little testosterone and too much estrogen it lowers his libido because remember your libido is testosterone based you have decreased morning erections males should have erections while they sleep and now still morning erections that's a sign of good testosterone health also to decrease erectile function so when i am when pace that they're talking to me i always ask them do they do they have a hard time starting the race maintaining the race or finishing the race because that could be an indicator that's too much estrogen in your system and not enough testosterone enlarged breasts man boobs okay our estrogen receptors for fat are in our male breasts and our gut so if you have too much estrogen yes this is where you become in this where you get enlarged breasts for men man boobs also to increase abdominal fat which is the visceral fat feeling tired all the time males who have high levels of testosterone should not be feeling tired testosterone gives you energy so if you lower your testosterone level increasing your estrogen this is where you're feeling tired all the time also - loss of muscle mass high astringent levels will decrease muscle mass no matter how much you work out because it's the testosterone that builds a muscle tissue also do emotional disturbances depression a lot of men who are depressed depression hits males and females totally different okay females is one way for males who are depressed it's because they're not they don't have enough testosterone they have too much estrogen all the - type - 2 diabetes again that's high levels of estrogen will preempt a man for type 2 diabetes also to increase the risk of prostate cancer now if you have too much estrogen in the system it increases the chances of prostate cancer okay so this is not good for men so the levels for the average woman varies according to their cycle so for the average woman you're looking anywhere from 27 to 370 picograms per milliliter okay for males we're looking at 15 to 60 on the average 24 27 to 30 so again you can see that a big there's a big difference between the males and females in the in the circulating estrogen levels in their system so how does it happen okay so what are some of the causes of males having higher estrogen levels in their system well one it could just be aging as males get older we decrease our testosterone levels and inadvertently we increase our estrogen levels so the average man of 65 years old has more circulating estrogen levels than his postmenopausal female counterpart so more estrogen than a postmenopausal female why because there is an enzyme that converts testosterone into estrogen and that's called the roma taste also - it could be the reason why increased fat okay that tissue contains this enzyme aromatisse now the more fat that a man has on his on his body again enlarged breaths belly fat visceral fat he's producing more roma taste so what's going on dance serves as a reservoir for storing estradiol astrid isle is a primary estrogen that females and their prime years need for their further mesocycle also to foods foods is a big one and gmo foods dairy foods again what happens in with the g with the gmo and the dairy especially dairy farmers remember they're increasing the levels of estrogen hormones in their cattle in their feed or gmo foods 90 % of gmo food is predominantly estrogen laced so this is another reason why males are increasing have high levels of estrogen in their system all to do faulty feedback the brain works on a negative feedback loop and this is very very hard to reverse expressly if you're not willing to change your diet and exercise so what happens when males have high levels of estrogens circling their system the brain the hypothalamus to the anterior pituitary gland kind of shuts down the signal to produce more testosterone okay so when males have higher levels of estrogen it inadvertently shuts down the production of testosterone so what can we do about it okay so then what do you do so the main goal when i'm talking with my patients is you want to increase your testosterone and lower the estrogen in your system okay so in no particular order the best way to do it cruciferous vegetables cruciferous vegetables like broccoli cauliflower cabbage so far and so on that will help that will that will inhibit the enzyme aroma taste that converts testosterone to estrogen so you want to eat increase your chorus vegetables how much just eat them again broccoli cauliflower kale so forth and so on that will help decrease your estrogen levels in your system also to decrease the phytoestrogen foods stop eating the foods that gives you increased estrogen soy soy is man's worst friend okay now there's different types of soy i know but i always throw caution in the wind just don't eat soy all together again so i isolated protein mixes don't don't eat them also - soy beans tofu and beer beer will again stimulates the estrogen receptors in the male's breast tissue and this visceral fat that increases estrogen decreases testosterone face it you never see anybody who's fit and trim who is an avid beer drinker also to increase your fiber exercise decrease weight when you do those your decrease in the estrogen levels naturally because why because when males exercises when we exercise it increases our testosterone levels when you increase your testosterone level you have the potential to increase building muscle mass which will inadvertently lower your estrogen levels also to of supplements indole -

        "video_sub_title": "welcome to slow home studio in today's tutorial we're going to learn how to use an architectural scale and in the previous tutorial john explained the overall concept of scale and how it relates the size of an architectural plan to dimensions in the real world today what we're going to do is wreck and actually learn how to measure things and items in the plan using the scale and this is an architect scale and if you don't have one they are available for sale through our slow home studio website and we will send one to you there are very very handy device particularly for contemplating doing a renovation or remodel to your home on this particular scale there are twelve different scales that relate to different size drawings so the first thing that you have to do is you have to figure out which of the scales on the ruler you're actually going to use in relation to your drawing and our drawing is 1 / 4 inch equals 1 foot so what that means is that for every quarter inch on our plan it is equal to 1 foot in reality so the very first thing we have to do is to find that scale on the ruler itself so come in and have a look here and you'll notice that on the ruler there are all of these different numbers on the edges and like i said there are 12 different scales on this ruler but if you look onto the ends you will see what the scale of a particular end of the ruler is and this one says 1 / 8 this one says 1 / 2 this one says 1 and this one says 1 / 4 and our scale of our drawing is 1 / 4 inch equals 1 foot so we know that this 1 / 4 is the side of the ruler that we need to use so that's the very most important thing that you have to do the second thing is you have to be able to figure out how to use the measurements and the increments on the ruler and relate them to the drawing so i'm going to show you how to do that so you're gonna have to come in closer and this is where you have to use your your eagle eyes because it's very very small but i'm going to show you first thing you need to do is you need to find the zero because the zero is where you start to measure from and you'll notice that on an architect's scale unlike a regular ruler the zero is not at the end it's actually kind of about a centimeter or so in from the end of the ruler and that's the starting point so what that means is that everything to the left of the ruler these lines here and you see the number two those are one foot increments so that's two feet that's four feet and that's six feet these small little half lines represent six inch increments so everything to the left of the zero reads in one foot increments and six inch increments so this number here would be five feet this number here would be four foot six so that's the first thing the second thing that you need to know is that everything to the right of the zero represents one inch increments and this is where you have to have supersonic eyes because these marks are extremely small but each one of those two scale represents an inch so you can actually measure at a quarter - inch scale down to the inch so that's three inches 6 inches 9 inches and 12 inches so now that we know that let's try to measure something in our plan and figure out how big it is so what we're going to measure is we're going to measure the dining room table because it's a good easy thing to measure because it's a rectangle so what i'm going to do is i'm going to go over to the dining room table and the first thing you need to do is you need to line the 0 up perfectly with the edge of the table like that you can see i've got my zero lined up with the edge of the table i'm going to measure the long length of the table first so i'm simply going to count that's one feet one feet one foot two feet three feet four feet five feet and six feet so we know that the table is at least six feet long but we also know it's a little bit longer than six feet because part of it is hanging off the edge of the six there so what you do is you then slide the scale so the six lines up perfectly with the edge of the table and then you count backwards from the zero side to figure out how many inches more than six feet it is and it's three inches more than six feet which means the long length of that table is six feet and three inches long do you see how that lines up with the edge there so now let's measure the short edge of the table so i'll just turn the ruler the other way again first thing you need to do when you're taking a measurement is you need to align the zero with the end that you're measuring so i've aligned it up you're going to count back one to three feet so i know that the short length of the table is three feet plus a few inches so to figure out the number of inches i'm going to slide the ruler down so that the three lines up with the edge of the table and count back and it's three inches so the short length of the table is three foot three inches so that's one thing you can do with the scale ruler the second thing you can do is you can actually use the scale ruler to draw something on sketch paper to scale and see how it fits on your plan so i'm going to show you how to do that and this is where it starts to get really fun and interesting because you can try placing furniture or different different book different size things into the floorplan so what i'm going to do is i'm going to take a piece of sketch paper and i'm going to draw a bookcase and i'm going to see how it fits into my floorplan and i'm going to draw a bookcase that is six feet long and 12 inches wide because that's a pretty typical dimension for a bookcase so come in close and i'm going to show you how to do this i'm going to mark the zero and i'm going to mark the six because that's the length of my bookcase and i'm simply going to draw a line in my pan between the two of them like that and you don't have to be perfect you just have to get the general sense of the scale and it's 12 inches wide so i'm going to mark the zero and go back one foot like that and then i'm just going to hand sketch the other two dimensions and close in my box so now i've used the scale ruler to draw a bookcase that is six feet long and one foot wide and now using the sketch paper i can take that and i can see where i could place that so for example in this house i would be able to place my bookcase against that wall in the dining room because i have at least six feet in order to place the bookcase and i would still have enough room to walk around to get into the dining room table so there's a couple ways that you can use a scale ruler to both measure a floor plan as well as to draw an object and try to place it in the floor plan in the next tutorial we're going to discuss how to use templates to actually draw furniture and fixtures to scale on your floor plan",

        "video_sub_title": "[ music ] children unmarked breathing i spoke in one episode about the craniofacial abnormalities and you know the children your mouth breathing and greater tendency towards protein our facial structure and jaws that are set back but children whom out breeds their sleep is likely to be impacted if your child is breathing true an open mouth during sleep and your child is more likely to have a shallow sleep and the more likely to have sleep interruptions sleep fragmentation and the more likely to be tired during the day this is not new stuff this has been discussed since 1909 if you go into google ng when you put in a dental cosmos you'll see the dental journal that was there at the time talks about the relationship between map reading and children and malocclusions but it also talks about the impact of mouth breathing during sleep and poor sleep that the teacher is likely to accuse the child of being an attentive in school if a child's sleep is not good their concentration is not good enough concentration is not gold academic performance is going to be impacted but also the child is likely to become frustrated because if we are requiring a child to sit down for six or eight hours and for absorb information and to concentration and if that child doesn't have the capacity because of poor sleep quality but then frustration is likely to send him a dd adhd are very related to sleep disorder breathing i just say that again children went to sleep disorder breathing which is very often is related to and have norman are poor development of the airway and i spoke to speak about that in a second a child with persley if untreated by the age of eight there's an 80 % chance that that child would have been permanent 20 % reduction in their mental capacity i'll give you another quotation children who are sleepy they are ten times the risk of learning difficulties in school and i'm not talking about children with obstructive sleep apnea i'm talking about children who even snore no child should snore if a child is snoring there is a restriction to their breathing during sleep this is impacting their sleep quality and this is going to impact their academic performance you know it yourself as an adult if you're watching this if you are tired you are not able to concentration and our children are the same you know if they're not getting the adequate sleep that they need they too will have difficulty in concentrating what's causing poor sleep madrid is causing poor sleep the child may have rhinitis they may have a fever the may have a stuffy nose the back of the nose maybe obstructed but enlarged adenoids they may have enlarged tonsils all of these things were contributed to my breathing or you may have a child who just map reads out of habit you know and they may have to time and as a result of tongue - tied the child wasn't able to get their tongue from the floor of the mouth child is difficulty breastfeeding child have to and adopt and shopping on the mother as the child tried to feed but breastfeeding of course it's not just about the nutrition for the baby but it's also about manipulation of the muscles necessary for craniofacial growth so we need children to have good muscle tone to be able to maintain nasal breathing and lack of press feeling and you know society is saying unfortunately a negative r over here and another aspect is the food if we're eating soft food were not really developing two jaws so children with poorly developed muscles of the face hour may not have the muscle to maintain nasal breathing so the child may be mad breathing because of habash or they may be mouth breathing because of obstruction but my quitting is map - reading no child should have their lips apart breathing in and out through the mouth for more than 30 seconds at a time yeah i got it children are talking all the time sometimes they never stop talk but watch your child when your child is distracted maybe after watching tv if they're watching videos does the child sit there with her mouth hanging open if your child is persistently and eventually breathing through an open mouth over a period of time let's look at changing that breathing pattern there's a series of breathing exercises which would have open up the front of the nose the beauty comment is a tremendous history at teaching young children how to restore nasal breathing how to remove the obstruction to the front of the nose how - decongestant those how to reduce breathing volume so that the child breathes comfortably through the nose it's not just enough to say to the child breathe through the nose because if the child is appropriating pattern as soon as the child closes their mouth that may feel that they're not getting enough air we need with breathing exercises change - i want what i'm teaching and working with kids i want to change their breathing patterns that they can breathe through their nose comfort spring because if they can breathe through their nose comfortably they are more likely to do it so we have a series of exercises and guidelines to have children switch to nose breathing we also have means of helping to determine where is the obstruction is it the front of the nose or is it the back of the nose so going forward and pay attention to your children how do they breathe how are they breathing during rest how are they breathing during physical exercise how are they breathing sleeeeep and if your child is sleepy far if your child is difficulty concentrating or if your child is you know attention deficit hyperactivity please investigate their sleep by investigating their sleep you can often get to the root cause of the problems that your faith your child is facing children they need help they need to restore nasal breathing and the late dr. christian game you know who would be considered as one of the fathers of sleep medicine he speaks about the critical importance of restoring nasal breathing butchering wakefulness and during sleep he also goes on to say that the only valid and complete correction of pediatrics sleep disorder breathing his restoration of nasal breathing and i quote that again the only valid and complete correction of pediatric sleep disorder breathing means restoration of nasal breathing [ music ]",

        "video_sub_title": "what's up youtube i've known rob for welcome to my youtube channel where we talk about guns to your bushcraft and hunting today i've got a diy project for you where we're going to construct a heat reflective survival tarp shelter so you know i'm big on tinkering diy i kind of been evil scientists whenever i get into the garage and i've had an experimental idea that i wanted to test out for a while finally gonna put it together for you what i'm going to do is take heat reflective mylar sheets commonly used for survival as survival blankets and permanently attach those to a tarp the hope is that this setup will retain more heat and keep me warm a realm underneath it gonna put together a small series based on this concept in this first video is going to cover the construction of the tarp itself the items you will need for this should cost under $ 20 likely less than that as there are pretty common household items but you'll need one tarp mylar sheets quantity depending on the size of the tarp and the mylar sheets heavy duty duct tape spray adhesive a sharpie and scissors the first step is to take the tarp and spread it out with the underside up to clean it of any dust and debris mines new so i don't need to clean it optionally it will be helpful to weigh down the four corners of the tarp the next step is to lay out the mylar as you want to placed on the tarp i'm going to cut it into four smaller sections and i'm choosing to do this rather than use one large piece in order to minimize the potential effect a tear might have so not to compromise the entire tarp as well as to reinforce the underside sections where the ridge line is going to contact the tarp i'm going to measure about three inches from the end of the tarp and mark that across all four corners and sides since i'll typically have the tarp secured with a ridge line running down either lengthwise or widthwise center four pieces will horn a plus with a ridge line to rest under regardless of which way i choose to set it up if you're following this suggestion leave a small amount of space for the tape to contact the tarp on the inner plus edges most likely area where heavin will first be compromised is the edge of the mylar therefore we will use duct tape to secure the edges now that one of the outer edges is secured we're going to use the spray adhesive slowly spray a section and roll the mylar down as you apply the adhesive don't try to spray the whole section because you'll likely get debris and won't get as clean of a contact with the mylar sheets for the last section so you don't over spray spray it in my lord instead of the tarp itself run your hands over the mylar to make sure any air spots get contact so the glue dries while it's in contact with the mylar now that you've got the first mylar section attached use the duct tape to secure the other outer edge you're following my suggestion to use sections of my life we'll duct tape the inner plots where the individual sheets meet with a single length of duct tape in order to keep weight down as much as possible after you do this repeat for the other sections of mylar you'll get the cleanest cut on the mylar by weighting it down and pulling or pressing the scissors across it rather than trying to cut it also helps to use the natural holes that exist in the meyer be sure to get under where the tape is covering the mylar so you get a good contact along the edge if you get any air pockets use something like an ice brush like i'm using alright so you've got all four pieces on just some afterthoughts after having gone through the process it's pretty difficult to make the cuts work out it might be better to cut a little bit longer and then once you've got the glue applied you can make the inner cuts for the plus because had some difficulty keeping the overlap consistent also important to keep the tarp taut as possible so that you don't get any folds or ripples in the tarp underneath that was a little difficult on one of the sections but turned out pretty well for a first - time experiment here now the last step is to just lay the plus general can you solve these ice cubes for 30 seconds so just some final considerations that i wanted to share did you have enough ice cubes can i talk now can i finish the video so we can go in the woods don't you want to go in the woods well we have to finish this and then we can go all right kim are you done with the ice cubes okay let's finish again once i've got the ridge line created i'll be able to cinch this down to a very small package total pounds about 2. 5 2. 5 5 pounds added less than a power this total tarp this is an 8 by 10 tarp i don't know the exact weight but i know that it was over a pound there she goes for another ice cube you had to get one last one ha but again minimal weight hopefully will add a little bit more heat to your survival tarp shelter in the event you're stuck out there it's nice to have something to keep you out of the elements without having to carry a tent every time you go out into the woods even my lightest tent with equipment necessary to set it up is about 4 pounds for a good three season tent it's about as low as i'm willing to go based on the quality that i want in a tarp construct excuse me in a tent construction so that's it for the construction of the target very simple design very lightweight gives you a little bit of added security whenever you're on a day trip or something like that lightweight small throw in your pack it's gonna give you a good shelter option should you get stuck out in the woods longer than you expect to but that's it for this video again that's it for the construction stay tuned for the rest of this series i'm going to show you how to make a ridge line in the next studio which is the second most important piece and then we'll go on to actually setting the shelter up as well as some other accessories that gear that you can use when creating in kind of pimping out your tarp shelter that's it for me guys as always stay safe i'm no more up for i'm out are you we don't have any more reduced an empty gym of the sheepdog i'm out please be sure to rate and comment on the video you just viewed for more videos on guns gear bushcraft and hunting subscribe by clicking the channel icon you can also see a link to my last video as well as to my other social media make sure to like no more opfor on facebook follow me on instagram and see detailed posts on my blog thanks for subscribing to know more opt for his youtube channel",

        "video_sub_title": "welcome to this edition the first stage show in this edition we're gonna look at the matt torniquet now this one's a little bit different from the captain okay and the soft teeth torniquet because it works on a pulley system so torniquet itself it's saucy shape to it and that close around the arm and on the top here you've got a winder but yet you wind up to high tension so when you actually put it on you can hold that up away from the arm and you can pull this through to tighten it on and then you physically wind it up so to apply this you slide the arm it slides it over the arm this one will work just as well on a leg there's plenty of material left there so we apply that over using the tail here we'll just pull that so it's tight on the top here is the release fences logic does make sure again there's five centimeters above the elbow and on here to lift that up and then we literally just wind it up we need to do it until we apply a lot of pressure on bend the tab over and on the the white section here you can write the time it's been applied and this works very well the only real disadvantage this one is in generally speaking we try and have the width of the torniquet at least three and a half centimeters whereas this one is a little bit narrow but it still works well it's very effective the only other thing with it is there's a metal buckle on it and the metal buckle is directly pushing into the skin so this will cause a bit discomfort but they do work effectively when we've actually put it on we will leave it on remember only a doctor in a hospital is removing this we need to make sure it's on tight enough if needed you can apply more pressure just by twisting it around a little bit more this one's very good as well because is each click we'll give you more tension whereas the other types you have to actually do a complete half turn now with this one if you're practicing this you then need to get it ready for use again and you need to take it off the other ones are quite easy well this one is also easy but you need to be a little bit more careful on the side here is a release button when you hit that release button it will release the tension but this tag at the top will spin around so make sure they don't hit and hit yourself on it so just push the button you see that just span around and then once you've done that you can push the button on the side to release the tape take it off of the arm and then to reset it just push the release button and just pull the strings out here now just make it go to the point where it's ready to use for the first time and then all you need to do is to tidy up the bounds and it's ready to use",

        "video_sub_title": "[ music ] joining us in the studio for this week's your health segment is dr. eric goldberg associate professor of medicine at the university of maryland school of medicine and director of gastrointestinal endoscopy at the university of maryland medical center dr. thank you for being with us thanks for having me we want to focus on the pancreas which is an organ that maybe most people aren't even familiar with where is it what does it do pancreas is a gland so it secretes hormones the biggest hormone that the pancreas secretes is insulin and insulin is very important for regulating your body's blood sugar so if you don't have insulin you can get diabetes and so pancreas plays a very vital role in that the pancreas also plays a vital role with digestion and so when we eat we have to secrete digestive juices to help break down proteins carbohydrates fats and the pancreas releases a lot of these enzymes into the digestive juices when when somebody has diabetes does that mean that there's something wrong with their pancreas or is there another set of factors i'm certainly not an expert on diabetes but what i can tell you is that certain types of diabetes are because of no the body has an immune reaction against insulin and then other types the body becomes resistant to the effects of insulin and so if you didn't have a pancreas you don't have insulin and you can develop diabetes or if you have some type of scarring condition in the pancreas it's going to lead to diabetes people do get pancreatitis which is an inflammation of the pancreas that's correct why does that happen there's a couple different types of pancreatitis and they have different causes there's an acute pancreatitis where patients can get acutely very very ill very quickly and develop life - threatening disease and then there's a chronic pancreatitis where there's kind of months and years of pancreatic injury where the pancreas becomes damaged and scarred and once it becomes scarred it doesn't work as well and so somebody who has acute pancreatitis it's typically in this country it's related to either a gall stone that has passed out of the gallbladder down the bile duct and at the end of the bile duct the bile duct and the pancreatic duct meet and then it blocks it up and can lead to a cascade of events that will inflame the pancreas the other major cause of acute pancreatitis in this country is alcohol consumption which is a direct toxin to the pancreas how can these cases be treated i it depends so for acute pancreatitis if somebody develops life - threatening illness the important thing is to kind of get them through that illness you have to rest the pancreas think of the pancreas is it's a digestive oregon and it's releasing digestive juices and these juices are designed to break down meat it's designed to break down sugars it's designed to break down fat the same things that our bodies are composed of and if these enzymes are getting out and digesting the pancreas itself it becomes a very painful unpleasant situation to be and it can trigger a lot of inflammatory processes in the body so the first step is to really rest the pancreas and we do this by not letting the patients eat and that will hopefully calm the pancreas down and while they can't eat you have to make sure they're getting fluid in nutrition and so supportive care is the mainstay of treatment and then also getting to an underlying cause if it's a gallstone that's blocking up the duct you have to get the gallstone out of the out of the bile duct and we mentioned you were the head of endoscopy is that something that can be done with a scope as opposed to at surgery it's something that used to be done almost exclusively surgically until about 1980 and then things began switching over to less invasive means there's actually a very much safer way of doing it is by an endoscopic technique called ercp where our scope is put down the mouth down into the intestines right where the bile duct opens up and from there we can insert catheters up into the bile duct and extract stones out what what are the symptoms how does somebody know that they're developing a problem and what a patient be able to guess it was the pancreas as opposed to something else you know in that general area yeah so the main symptom of pancreatitis is pain and this is generally a pretty severe pain that's going to send someone to the hospital it's not like a mild ache it's a pretty severe pain that's in the epigastrium which is the upper portion of your abdomen and it penetrates into the back other symptoms that we see or nausea and vomiting and when it's severe then patients can develop signs of organ failure they start getting problems with their breathing they started having problems with their kidneys functioning because the pancreas sets off an inflammatory cascade that will disrupt a lot of different organs functions let's take a phone call for you this is fred in baltimore county fred thank you for the call go ahead my question is i was many years ago taken to a hospital with diabetes symptoms i mean a gallbladder symptoms and then when they determined that i had gall sand in my bile duct rather than stones then they discovered i had pancreatitis and they couldn't do anything and that my pancreas healed so after a couple weeks the pancreas recovered and then they went in and removed my gallbladder and discovered it was like a piece of leather hadn't functioned for years but my question is i had no evidence my diabetes was discovered by my family doctor he's treating me for depression and then i went in for a visit and he asked about history diabetes my family checked my urine juror and that was high and kept me for glucose tolerance test everything was diabetic but my question is i had no evidence that the hospital was my pancreas had problems that they checked me for any evidence of diabetes never the same but then such a simple test fred thank you so much for the phone call any thoughts yeah so certainly it sounds like fred had acute gallstone pancreatitis so even though he didn't have a stone he had some one we call sludge and effectively that's the same thing as having a stone in your bile duct because it'll travel out of the gallbladder it'll go down lodge at the end of the bile duct and block up the pancreatic duct as well and there people get acute pancreatitis and the nice thing about acute pancreatitis if there is a nice thing to say because it's like it's oh no it's a very painful condition but once patients recover from an acute bout of pancreatitis and they generally recover completely there are exceptions to that rule when someone has necrosis or destruction of their gland but in general people will recover complete function from is from their acute gallstone pancreatitis and so the development of diabetes 1020 years later after an episode it's probably unrelated to that single episode of pancreatitis is there an age in just a few seconds is there an age where we're pancreatitis tends to occur i think because gall stones and alcohol consumption are the main causes it's it's uncommon to see you know gall stone in a 10 year old it's much more common to see in someone over the age of 40 similarly you're not going to have a ten - year - old who's an alcoholic and sin takes many years of alcohol consumption to damage the pancreas so you typically see it after the age of 30 we've got ours dr. goldberg the airacobra at the university of maryland thank you for being with us thank you your health segments are a co -

        "video_sub_title": "hi i'm andrew simpkins the dme coordinator at cal sports and today we're going to talk about the dawn joy ultra slim three so a few main pointers on this sling is going to be these straps so this will be the shoulder strap and the main thing about this sling is it's going to help to immobilize your arm so you're not going to be actively moving it after the procedure it will have a pillow here that'll take the arm a little bit away from the body into abduction that takes a lot of the stress off of the repair the big part about this link is going to be the shoulder strap noted by this shoulder pad here as well as a waist strap that will wrap around your waist to secure the sling to your body into the arm to the body it does have a thumb strap that will wrap around the thumb you don't want to use this right after the procedure until you regain feeling in your thumb as well have a nerve block after the procedure so as soon as you can feel your thumb have sensation there we do encourage you to use that thumb strap and then we'll go right around the webbing of your finger there is also another strap here on the brace that will go wrap around forearm and the really main reason for this one is just to secure the arm into the sling so now what we'll do is we'll also go ahead and show you how to put on this link you can't do this by yourself and so we'll go ahead and practice that with you're in it my recommendation is to have the sling facing you and if this was my right arm what i would do is i would bring this link close to you on the table if you have a higher counter in a kitchen it works a little bit easier but any type of a table should be sufficient first thing that you'll do is you'll have your arm supported by your opposite arm and what you can do is you're going to just slide your hand into this lane and then you can slide the back of the sling back under the elbow this sling should fit into this position here next i do the velcro strap over the forearm to secure the arm into the sling and then i grab this shoulder strap note the shoulder strap with the shoulder pad and you're going to throw this as far back on your right shoulder for me it's my right shoulder you're going to throw that as far behind your shoulder as possible so that way you get a angle coming up over your left shoulder for me it's a lot easier to use this velcro rather than to go through these buckles but that's completely up to you whatever use your for you taking the velcro with the velcro facing up you're going to go through the o - ring and velcro it back onto the strap once this strap is attached your sling is now supported and you can stand up and you're going to position the sling off to the side the reason why we want it off to the side is because we're actually gaining that external rotation rather than keeping it here locked up in the front so the correct position is going to be here off to the side of the arm last but not least you're going to grab this waist strap you're in the back and you're going to buckle that into the front buckle it does have this ball here on the front we do encourage you to squeeze that ball you're going to be isometrically contracting those muscles but you're not actively going to be moving the arm it helps to cut down on atrophy which is the muscles wasting away because if you don't use them you live them and so this is the don droid ultra slim 3 andrew at some point during the recovery period we let people remove the pillow and we let them know when we want them to do that or when it's okay to do that can you show people how to do that yes absolutely first to remove the sling what you'll do is again going over to a table first i undo the vote are the buckle here at the waist next the velcro strap on the forearm keeping this around your neck i've reached our lean down support the arm onto the table i'm not pushing down on to the table i'm just supporting the arm so it's had somewhere to sit next i'll go through the velcro through the o - ring blow that over the shoulder and then again using my other arm to support this the arm coming up and out of the the sleeve to remove the pillow there is a velcro piece here and you need to just peel that away and now you have your regular sling great can you also show them how to bend and flex keys me extend and flex their elbow wrist and fingers as one of the exercises that we encourage them to do so they don't get a lot of swelling in their forearm and absolutely so after the procedure we do encourage the pendulum exercises and you're really just going to picture you have a quarter on the floor and really you're just going to go around that quarter so it's a very small circle very small motion and we do want these clockwise and counterclockwise the next exercise is going to be a flexion and extension exercise with this one here you're going to start with your arm extended you're going to curl your fingers up curl the wrist up and then curl the arm up if you need to support your arm with your left hand or your opposite arm you can do so to extend extend the fingers first then the wrist and then the arm that's great because you're actually showing that you're not moving your shoulder at all in that exercise correct that stays in the same position perfect thank you",

        "video_sub_title": "hi cindy here physical therapist with adaptive equipment corner today we are talking about crutches we are going to talk about how to adjust crutches in the following two videos we will show you how to use them and how to use them on stairs so i've got a standard set of crutches here these are aluminum that's what most of them are made of now and you have to adjustments when you're looking at crutches that you need to pay attention to so the first adjustment here is in the height here at the bottom and again this kind of has the push button adjustment kind of like your walkers and your canes do so that's going to be at the bottom of the crutch and then at the top of the crutch here you have an adjustment in handle height or grip height for your hands and this is usually you have a bolt with a wing nut and you can take that off that wing nut comes off and then you adjust the height of the handle so when you're looking at adjusting crutches for yourself or someone else the crutch height you need to be careful because you don't want the top of the crutch to be resting right up in the armpit area you want about a three finger width or four finger width space between your armpit and the top of the crutch because you have some nerves and blood vessels that run in that area that you don't want to put pressure on you don't want to hang on the top of these crutches so you want the weight when you're using him to go through your hands so again you want about a three or four finger width distance between your armpit and the top of the crutch and that's with the crutch rusting rusting about oh say three or four inches away from your foot here it's not going to be right up next to your foot you just kind of let it rest against your side and take a look at the height here now as far as the hand adjustment or the grip adjustment here you want just a mild bend in your elbow if you have the grip too low as you see my arms gonna be too straight it's not going to allow me to get very good leverage whenever i put weight through my hands if you have it too high again it's not going to allow for very good leverage when you're walking so the hand grip when your hands are on the grips you should have a mild bend in your elbow you should again have this space between your the top of the crutch and your armpit so that you're not resting or hanging on the crutches as you walk so that's how you adjust crutches stay tuned and follow up with how to use the crutches on stairs and how to walk with them have a great day and don't forget if you can't do it adapt it",

        "video_title": "Diastasis Recti Exercises - Physical Therapy Diastasis Repair Exercises",
        "video_sub_title": "hi, i'm michelle. well today we're looking at some basic exercises to start the repair for your rectus diastasis. now remembering that your rectus diastasis ( if you've got one ) is a separation of the upper abdominal muscles, so it's really important that you're not doing any intense core exercises like full planks and sit - up exercises, which are going to in effect separate that area even more. the exercises to start with are these gentle exercises for your deep abdominal core muscles. we're going to start by finding those deep abdominal muscles and i'd like you ( if you're at home ) to exercise along with me, lying yourself down flat on your side to find those muscles. coming down into that side - lying position so, what i'd like you to start by doing is letting your tummy relax. now, i think you can feel these abdominal muscles really well in this side lying position. you're feeling the area below your navel ; the area that would sit below your briefs. and use your fingers inside, just inside that pelvic bone to feel that area there. in that position, let your tummy muscles relax, and now very gently draw the abdominal wall inwards just a little bit. so try to draw in and hold. hold and breathe and see if you can feel that gentle tension developing in that lower area of your tummy. you really need to get this part of the exercise going first of all before we start progressing you along. so see if you can contract those muscles gently, and hold and breathe. how are you going at home? can you hold those muscles on gently? and then relax. after you've had your baby and after pregnancy it can be really difficult to find these deep abdominal muscles because they've been so stretched. we'll try again one more time on your side. hands over the inside ( you can go over your briefs or over your clothes, ) you might feel them better underneath your clothes just feeling directly against the abdominal wall. and drawing in gently and just feeling a gentle tension developing in that area of your lower abdomen. hold and breathe, hold and breathe, keep holding and breathing and feel that gentle in - draw and now relax. all right, now if you can feel those, you're ready to roll over onto your back. we'll find those and start into some very gentle pilates - style exercises. so rolling over onto your back now, again, using your fingers ( both hands this time ) so feeling in that area, you can use the hands inside and then you can actually try again ( keeping the inward curve in your lower back, ) try to gently brace that abdominal wall. and, this is challenging to feel. you should feel just a very gentle tension develop in your lower abdomen. you might find that your pelvic floor muscles contract two at the same time. that's great if they do. hold and breathe. hold and breathe and relax down. so as we do the next exercises, i'd like you to use that activation to encourage the repair for that diastasis. so let's start now. so, fingers on your pelvis. shoulders back. and then we're going to start with an exercise called a bent - knee fallout. now with a bent - knee fallout, the leg comes down to the side and back up. but it's the deep abdominal muscles that stop your torso from rolling to the side. so, in that position : gently activate your deep abdominal muscles. imagine you've got a glass of water balanced on one leg ( that's the stationary leg. ) now, the other leg moves slowly down to one side while you're contracting those tummy muscles. down to the side. as soon as you start to feel your pelvis start to roll ( which won't be very far ) then come back up to the center and relax. and you might find that quite challenging ; it's a challenging exercise to do well. again. tummy muscles activated. gently lower the leg down to the side to where you can. keep the tummy muscles gently braced. keep your glass of water balanced on the other leg. bring the leg back up to center and relax. and i can feel that's quite challenging on my tummy. okay, have a big breath in and out and we're gonna go to the other side, so : fingers on the abdominal wall, activate the lower abdominal muscles, take the leg down to the other side, don't let your pelvis roll and come back up to center and rest. and when i say don't let your pelvis roll, i mean not to let your hips roll. so you can feel the trunk rolls or you can actually see my trunk rolling there. you've gotta keep it really stable. you feel over your pelvic bones, you can then check for that stability. rest your abdomen. rest down through your shoulders. now we're going to move into a heel - slide exercise. so, with the next exercise involves again activating the lower abdominal muscles, maintaining the inward curve in your lower back, and this time sliding the heel down along the ground, sliding down until you feel that your back starts to arch as soon as it does come back up into the return, back to starting position, and relax. and again, tummy muscles braced very gently, keep the normal curve in your back, slide your foot down and then bringing it back up. as soon as you feel your lower back curve starting to change and relax. and we can do that on the other side as well. let's do a couple more on the other side. tummy muscles are activated. slow controlled breathing, slide the heel down, sliding along the mat, sliding down gently and bringing it back up, and once more taking it down. just slow and steady, controlled, guiding it back up and relax your tummy muscles. you might like to do some very gentle pelvic tilts, flattening the curve of your back, down and back. so when you're just starting out, you're aiming to do roughly ten second holds with your breathing, and then you start to do what you can with your bent - knee fallouts and with your heel - slides. you might start with a couple of exercises and increasing up to perhaps ten on one side and ten on the other for each of those exercises. ideally if you could do those every day that would be terrific. well let's review what we've just done there. we've done how to activate your deep abdominal muscles. we've talked about bent - knee fallout exercises and also your heel - slide exercises to promote your rectus abdominis repair and the importance of avoiding your intense abdominal core exercises. well, for some more deep core exercises and core abdominal exercises, visit me at pelvicexercises. com. au. i look forward to exercising with you again soon. bye for now.",

head lettuce here i've got some little gem lettuce as well some loose carrots i like to buy them loose i'm not wasting anything because i don't always need a full bag i have some cause yet i have some red onions then blueberries raspberries strawberries and a lemon tea bananas increment by 5 but i bought them loose again and i obviously didn't click enough times so we have to you might need to get some more of those because we go through them like anybody's business i got two packs of easy peelers because these were substituted for another one that i was going to buy so now we have loads but that's fine because we all like them in this house i have some mangoes and some red chillies and then i've got some peppers here can you cumber some charlotte potatoes and then i order cherry tomatoes

giant crumpets because i'm going to do like crumpit sort of pizzas i guess for breakfast when i make my own tomato sauce and top it with cheese which thought would be quite nice then i've got some pita breads some white wraps underneath there and then these are the baps that we're going to have with the pork later and then over here is more store cupboard stuff i guess so i've got some mung beans to make a mung bean dal i've never had these before so i'm quite excited to try those and then i've got some brown basmati rice some honey and almond granola and i have some raspberry jam

so as promised i said i would share my meal plan and i've got it on my computer here i tend to like make a note of everything as i'm doing an online shop so just finally easier and i have got a few days worth of food here including pretty near because i was using things up around the house so for example on new year's eve eve we had nigella's sausage and saffron pasta which is from her new book and i'm really really enjoying that and then at near zero my grandma and gramps his house and then year's day my mom and dad actually made of this gorgeous butternut squash like cannelloni which they brought round and i heated up and it was so nice to have home we was so tired i have to be not with the chicken parts bill and mark had a hangover as well which wasn't great and then i have as following and this might mix up actually i'm not sure but we've got jamie oliver's hoisin chicken lettuce wraps which is from his five ingredients book we had chicken and chorizo rice which is kind of like a paella but without seafood because i hate the stuff i then got jamie all of his lemony courgette linguini and then nigella's mung bean and lentil dal with chapati and then i've also got hog roast but as i mentioned with nigella salt and vinegar potatoes and then i've also got lunches and snacks just being extra organized so got like hummus and light things to dip in some like pitabread cucumber carrot sticks ham sandwiches cheese toast tuna sandwiches we've got yogurts fruit cheese and biscuits salad like you know you could have like potato salad course or me like salad vegetables that sort of thing and got the bunny crisps and then there's biscuits and treat so i'm around the house as well after christmas and then for breakfast we've got like toast and chairman fruit got

        "video_sub_title": "greetings, it's eric bakker the naturopath from new zealand. thanks for coming back to my channel. let's talk about eosinophils today. have you heard of that word eosinophil? it sounds almost like a brand new type of hyundai or a kia car or a new model that toyota released, but in fact it's a white blood cell. there are several types of white blood cells. so i'm not at this video going to explain all about lymphocytes and neutrophils and the activity of the cells. it's just too much. okay? way too much information. it's like giving you all the specs on a car and all this sort of stuff. who cares? let's just get with it and talk where the rubber meets the road. all right? so eosinophils are one of about, i think there's four or five types. i think it's five types of white blood cells that the body produces. eosinophils at one of those types. it's only a very low percentage. i think it's something like one or two or 3 % of the total white cell count. so your blood basing is a fluid, red blood, red blood cells, white blood cells. all right? and they all perform different functions. but eosinophils are commonly pick up in a blood test. so you need to have a certain amount before, if you've got a certain amount that goes over a threshold, then you've got eosinophilia. you can also have hypereosinophilia and even weirder terms than that. so depending on how many you've got in your blood, you'll be basically told whether you've got eosinophilia. so what the eosinophils do is they really, they're a specialized subset of white cells in the body, a type of white cell, they're involved in inflammation. there are a red flag for doctors for things like parasitic conditions, but also candida or fungal conditions can push eosinophils up. auto - immune conditions, crohn's disease or diseases like that. ulcerative colitis can result in a higher than normal eosinophils count. pharmaceutical medications can be implicated in them as well. so often when the eosinophils count goes up, the doctor's going to be looking for allergies, auto immune diseases, infections, inflammation, but also neoplastic disorders, a fancy word for cancer, basically. so yeah, so investigations go in to find out what the causes are. and usually the end result will be, \" well, let's not worry too much about it, \" or, \" we found some parasite. let's give some drugs for the parasites. \" but sometimes if it's unexplained, the eosinophilia, or linked with auto immune condition, sometimes steroids will even be given, prednisone or drugs like that. or certain types of chemotherapy drugs could be given as well. [ inaudible 00 : 02 : 38 ]. i'm not quite sure. it's got a weird name, but there are drugs like that used for cancer that are sometimes given to patients with high eosinophil counts to bring them down. so what do you do if the eosinophils go up? how do you get them down again? well, it's obvious that to get something down when it's up, you need to find what pushed it up in the first place. okay? so if it's unexplained or the doctor can't really work it out, my request view would be again, tell them, i sound like a broken record, would be to do a stool test to see if there's parasites. so if a doctor has failed to find a parasite with testing, then i would recommend you go further and do a comprehensive stool analysis with your naturopathic doctor or integrative medical doctor and say, \" look, let's just go a bit deeper before you start putting me on all these heavy drugs. let's see if there is actually is a cause, \" because in many cases, a cause will be found if you are willing to look for that cause. okay? it's like losing a pair of scissors in the house or a bunch of keys. there's always one person that doesn't give up and usually finds them, all right? but nine out of 10 people will give out. they just buy a new pair of scissors or get another key cut. but that one out of 10 will find it. so you could be that one out of the 10 to find what the cause is. now, if it's allergies, if it's a parasite, if it's a yeast problem, that's right, you got to work on the gut. you've got to try and get rid of that parasite. all right? i've mentioned many times on this channel where a comprehensive stool analysis in our clinic picked up a patient's parasite. when in the medical profession, it failed to shop anything. that's because, remember, in medicine, usually in most western countries, they're going to test for very narrow band of parasites. they're not going to test for thousands of types of parasites that you would expect from a comprehensive stool test. so there could be certainly, something they're overlooking. the second one, is there a yeast species like candida that are also linked with high eosinophils. i've seen this repeatedly in the clinic where candida was linked. and once the candida went, the eosinophil count dropped right down, well below 500. okay? eosinophils per microliter of blood. i've seen it again and again and again. so, and of course, there are doctors out there that still don't believe that yeasts can trigger eosinophila. but guess what? they can. studies show that, all right? clinical experience has shown that. but also allergies can sometimes push it up. now, remember might take on allergies, heal the small intestine and get off antibiotics. i went camping with tracy for three days. and the lady at the camping side, i spend an hour talking to her about her 18 year old daughter who's been on antibiotics since she was three years of age. all right? and since then she's been on asthma drugs and steroids, and now her gut's being destroyed. now she's got eating disorders and emotional problems. and i said to mum, i said, \" look, by the time this girl's 40, she'll have an auto immune disease. it's a certainty. she's got to get off the antibiotics. \" so if you're taking an antibiotic, or if you're taking a pharmaceutical drug and your eosinophils count is high, ask the doc that if you can come off these medications. anything that adversely affects the functionality and health of your digestive tract can create a massive imbalance. and that imbalance can certainly include the proliferation of yeast or bad bacteria. parasites can easily come in. blastocystis hominis now is a parasite that now, as far as many doctors is concerned, is a normal part of the bowel flora. and it's not supposed to be, but because it's so endemic now, i suppose it's a bit like obesity, accepted as the norm. so there you have it. work on the digestive system. find out what the cause of the eosinophilia is. don't just be satisfied with going on a steroid to suppress the immune system, okay? it's not good. if you keep suppressing things, then one day there'll be a knock on the door. okay? and it won't be from the cops. it'll be from nature saying it's had enough of you trashing it all the time, and you're going to get sicker and sicker and sicker. the cause is always worth finding. allergies, look at your diet more carefully. maybe you work with the naturopath, try and go on a low allergy diet. inflammation, go on a low inflammation diet. i've given you plenty of information on this channel on low inflammatory type ways of eating. by working with your digestive system and improving it to a higher spec, you're in a much better position to understand if the eosinophilia is linked with something that you're doing or that your body has created as a result of your ways of eating or living. it makes sense to me. thanks for tuning in.",

        "video_sub_title": "how's it going everyone so today i'm gonna talk about how to get rid of canker sores on your tongue so before we get started please subscribe at my channel you guys haven't already i do appreciate the support it helps my channel grow also if you're interested in online personal training for me simply comment below in the comment section and i will get back to you guys with more details so canker sores on your tongue are also called axios ulcers the these are caused by numerous and different factors tissue injury or biting your tongue is the reason why people get canker sores on their tongue vitamin deficiency a lack of iron and a lack of vitamin b12 a lack of folic acid can also cause canker sores you guys so eating acidic foods salty and spicy foods also contribute in getting canker sores on your tongue and the way that we are as a civilization you guys is that we follow a western diet which is extremely high in sodium the average amount of sodium that we should have per day is 2, 300 milligrams i like to try to get around 1, 500 to 2, 000 milligrams simply because lots of diets especially the dash diet recommends people who have high blood pressure eat 1500 milligrams of sodium so the less sodium in my opinion the better but again our bodies for proper function we need at least 1500 milligrams you guys and 1500 mm that's a good estimate what with the western diet people are eating 3, 500 to 4, 000 milligrams of sodium per day so it's way way too high that's another reason why we get canker sores is because of salt you guys so watch your diet if you're eating super super high bad foods or lots of junk food lots of processed foods you're gonna be getting canker sores and i noticed too if i ever binge a little bit on my diet because i can eat a ton of calories i'm bulking on 5000 you guys if i go to like a buffet or something and i get lots of sodium i will get canker sores in the next day so really watch your salt to you guys really watch your salt so how can we get rid of them the simplest and easiest method to get rid of a canker sore is going to always be basic salt and water now this seems super contradictory i know canker sores are caused by salt so what are we gonna do get rid of them we're gonna put salt on them like it seems so weird i know like like when i figure this out as like what like that seemed very weird but again it works you guys it does work salt helps the tongue sore heal faster because it stops and kills the growth of bacteria i personally like to put one tablespoon of salt into one cup of water i will mix it up and then i will gargle with it what you can also do is put a little bit of salt on your finger and then just put your finger on the open wound and touch it it's gonna burn like crazy but after it burns you're gonna get a sense of relief and you're gonna be like that's amazing trust me on this method number two use ice cubes this will numb the pain and help speed up the process apply only for a short period of time a few minutes - five minutes is plenty of time method number three make sure you brush your teeth after each meal with tongue sores this will keep your mouth area clean this will also maintain good oral health method number four honey has antifungal properties it increases wound healing reduces inflammation and kills bacteria use honey on your swords that this will make a huge difference certain foods and products may increase the pain or swelling you have with your tongue bumps avoid spicy and acidic foods and tobacco you guys so i will put in the description box a product that i use myself you guys this product what it does and it's probably similar to to some other products but what you do and again i will link it is you get a little bit of the drops and all you're going to do is you put one one drop that's all you need and it's gonna go on the open sort now what's it's gonna do is it's gonna make a little filament around the open sore and it's gonna cover the filament or cover the open the open sore with a little filament and it's gonna numb it - just for a little bit now this real and i only recommend doing this if you guys have like four or five or six canker sores at one point again because i might died i'm eating lots of calories and this was like a couple of this was a year ago i think a year and a half ago when i really wasn't too concerned that much about my sodium level since then i have really watched it but um i had one point had six canker sores all around my mouth it just wasn't on my tongue and it was awful it was extremely painful i will tell you that anything was salt acidic it burned like that and i was in pain you guys and i knew instantly i'm like why did i have all that salt you guys so the product that i will put in the description box you guys can cry it out again i'm telling you this don't you don't need it if you don't have if you only have one or two canker sores don't buy the product don't waste your money at all trust me on this but if you got five or six they're causing you a ton of pain i would recommend trying it it worked for me and again i only recommend products that i do actually use myself i still think i might actually have some of it upstairs so if i can find it maybe i will put a maybe i'll put a little ending to the video but chances are i don't i don't remember if i brought it over with me when we did move houses so i can't really say for sure right now if i do have it upsurge not but i recommend trying that out because that has worked for me but again it was around my general mouth area it wasn't necessarily on my tongue so i can't 100 % clarify that it's going to work for your tongue but again just something else that i genuinely want to share with you guys just because if it's helped me it can help you and yeah so those are actually the five methods that i i have listed before i only have four i thought i would add that extra one so end the video thank you guys so much for watching please subscribe to my channel if you guys haven't already i do appreciate all your guys's support love please like the video and share it again thanks for watching and have a great day everyone",

        "video_sub_title": "[ music ] hi i'm chris harper and with me is makayla and we are here to demonstrate and application for heel pain. this can be pain at the heel or very low back of the ankle. some causes of this may be overuse, repetitive impact activities, poorly fitting or worn shoes, or ankle and calf tightness. kt tape helps treat this condition by relaxing the associated muscles approximating tissue to form an addition natural pad. for this application, we are going to place the ankle in dorsiflexion or in other words, bring those toes toward the ankle as much as possible. and we're going to tear off our first piece, one full strip. we're going to twist and tear the backing paper right down the middle and peeling that back being careful not to touch the adhesive, just handle the paper of the tape. we're going to place this just under the heel with about eighty - percent stretch so if you stretch it all the way and then back off just a little bit. that's about right. we're going to angle this tape as we apply it with that stretch so it end up just behind the ankle bones. we're going to remove that last little bit of tape from the ankle bones on up with absolutely zero stretch, we're going to do this exact same thing on the opposite side of the foot, the outside part of the foot. we're going to give that a quick rub just to create to make sure that it is adhering well that helps heat up the adhesive. we're going to take our next full strip we're going to twist and tear the backing paper again, right in the middle of the tape. peel that back, being careful not to touch the adhesive we're going to place this behind the heel again with eighty - percent stretch. we're going to lay that down, and as we come towards the mid - food, we're going to easy off that tension applying that last bit of paper with absolutely zero stretch. same thing on the opposite side just on the outside pare to of the foot, laying that down with absolutely zero stretch. ok, and for our last piece we're going to take another full strip and this time we are going to twist and tear down towards the logo end of the tape to create an anchor, this is going to be applied just ahead of the other pieces on the mid foot, the sole of the foot. give that a good rub, we're going to remove the paper backing leaving a little bit on the handles, don't touch the adhesive. this time we are going to apply this with about fifty percent stretch, so back that about half way off. we're going to apply this right under the heel and along that achilles tendon rubbing that down, then again the last little bit of tape or just going to apply that with absolutely zero stretch tap that arch down, and give the whole thing a good friction rub. excellent! again that friction creates heat and that allows the adhesive to really stick to the skin. ok now rub the whole thing very well. okay, some tips before apply this is to make sure you clean the skin very well. remove any skin oils, or lotions. you can wear socks to sleep so the tape doesn't get rolled up on the sheets. some complementary treatments may include light massaging, stretching, ice, rest, and properly fitting shoes. please seek care if you have excessive swelling bruising or sever pain. for more information visit our website at www. kttape. com",

        "video_sub_title": "howdy there my friends this is sam fredrickson from preventing cavities comm today i'm going to tell you how to prevent baby bottle tooth decay now baby bottle tooth decay is a condition that comes about when a child's teeth are stripped of enamel through the process of bottle - feeding now the main leading reason for this is of course sugar hmm we don't want none of that sugar for the babies it will hurt 13 now the most important thing is to be aware of how much sugar there is and everything you give your child for example those juice boxes that they love so much not a good idea my friend all those juice boxes apple juice orange juice all that has so much added preservatives and added unnatural sugar that it is simply not what your baby needs right now now in addition to that and this is the most important and kind of shocking thing is that all of that formula b formula that you can get from the store is chock full of preserved preservatives and unnatural sugars that are unhealthy for your baby and open the door to baby bottle tooth decay now the most important way we can prevent this is through breastfeeding because breast milk is all natural and there's nothing in that that's going to harm your baby so it's completely and totally safe however there are other methods as well to help cut down the risk of toddler tooth decay and one of the most important is not giving your baby a bottle to sleep with it right because whatever's in that bottle whether it be formula juice anything really it's gonna have some sort of sugar now that sugars gonna get into their mouth when they drink it and it's just gonna stay there all night long and the acid in that sugar is gonna start scrubbing away at that enamel and that my friends is one of the leading causes of baby baby bottle tooth decay so what can we do to fix it well like i said earlier we always need to be aware of the amount of sugar and preservatives that are the things that we give our children but cutting out the bad stuff isn't always enough we need to add in the good stuff so a great substitute for those formulas for those juice boxes and all that is simply whole milk it has so little added sugar and contains all the vitamins and nutrients necessary to help your baby grow up to be big and strong and especially to help their teeth stay healthy now in addition to this my friends i know it's gonna be hard but please don't give in to them don't give them their candies their their sodas their juices i know they look so adorable and so cute but my friends it's simply not worth it even a thing such as skim milk has more added sugar than is healthy for your baby so remember my friends stay strong it's gonna be hard but they'll thank you at the end thank you so much i'm sam frederickson from preventing cavities doc you",

        "video_title": "Why Do Some Shots Make Your Arm Hurt So Much?",
        "video_sub_title": "[UNK] intro you \u2019 ve probably gotten a lot of shots in your lifetime... the ones you probably freaked out over as a baby, all the way up to your last flu vaccine. either way, you might remember some shots being nastier than others. like, some aren \u2019 t that bad at all, hardly more than a pinch. but others hurt like no one \u2019 s business, and can make your arm sore for days afterward. in general, a little pain after a shot isn \u2019 t a bad thing. it just means your body is learning to recognize and fight off a pathogen, like the flu virus, so that you don \u2019 t get really sick if it shows up again. but it doesn \u2019 t mean that the pain is, well, any less of a pain. how much a shot hurts depends on a lot of things, including where you get jabbed, what \u2019 s in the vaccine, and of course, your personal feeling about needles. you might think that a bigger needle and a deeper shot would hurt more. but in most cases, those deeper injections into muscle, or what doctors call intramuscular shots, actually pose less of a problem than the ones given just under the skin. scientists aren \u2019 t totally sure why this is, but they think part of it has to do with the way that each tissue absorbs fluid. if you inject a bunch of fluid into fatty skin, it doesn \u2019 t have much of a place to go and can get trapped, which can be painful. muscles, meanwhile, are full of blood vessels and can clear out the liquid much more quickly, so they tend to cause less pain, swelling, and redness. as a bonus, muscles also tend to have a better mix of immune cells, so intramuscular shots are often more effective. besides where the shot is given, how much a shot hurts also depends on what \u2019 s in it. some vaccines contain adjuvants, which are materials added to vaccines to make it easier for your immune system to recognize the pathogen you want to avoid. they \u2019 re inflammatory, and made of things like aluminum, or small parts of bacteria. they \u2019 re harmless, but since they aren \u2019 t normally found in your body, adjuvants cause more immune cells to come to the scene of the injection to check out what \u2019 s there, and to begin processing it. it turns out that some of the more painful vaccines, including those that protect against tetanus or the human papillomavirus, also called hpv, tend to have adjuvants in them. and in the case of hpv, the version of the vaccine that patients report as being more painful actually has two adjuvants in it. if that sounds terrible, remember, they \u2019 re there because they make the vaccine work better. in fact, so far, it looks like the double - adjuvant vaccine might help people have stronger and longer - lasting protection. scientists are still working on making vaccines less painful, but for now, it \u2019 s no pain, no gain, as they say. although, of course, if you have severe pain after a shot, or if it \u2019 s lasting a long time, you should consult your doctor. we are definitely no substitute for professional medical advice. scishow is produced by complexly, a group of people who believe the more we understand, the better we get at being human. if you want to learn more about vaccines, shots, or anything else related to healthcare, you can go check out one of our other channels, healthcare triage, over at youtube. com / healthcaretriage.

        "video_sub_title": "hey yeah this is our destiny and think the camera from the death okay let me let me let me let me talk face so this video is just pretty much gonna be about my hair pretty much what i do after i turned the camera off because y'all see me do these curls out of time but it's like okay we'll know how you sleep on it how you take care of it or none of these so i'm going to show you how to sleep on my hair how i manage it you know to make a lance for whole week because i don't just get up and go everyday these curls don't just i mean they do pop like they blew you know i had to make a prop like the up hopefully the camera i'll just rent in the ground while i'm talking but if you do just enjoy the video but yeah i sleep kinda how i wanna sleep but i sleep in a bun and you can if you want to wear bunny when taking a shower because you don't want your eggs to get wet if they do get wait what i do out takes like holding spray on my hands and i do like this to scrunch it i didn't do that in video on things but if my ends get weird and stuff they're like structure like this and it's the piece already i had the two truffles you guys girl scout cookies time tim that had a good cause i like them blow oh yeah that's the blue box oh let's turn in my chair how much is that the video speak for yourself and if you have any questions or comments leave it down below my camera crew now with me today so i'm like i don't got contact with let me out i can't take you know alright so this is my flexi rod said that i did i wore this style for about five days and in this video you'll see how i you know maintain the over the course of these five days because it doesn't look like this every day when i wake up i have to you know maintain it and freshen it up just to be i'm just showing you how silky looks at how shiny the hair is so when i'm laying down on my hair i pretty much just lounge around however i want to lounge you know when i'm texting or whatever and just laying down in my bed i just rest on all of my pillows because it kind of keeps my hair from being flat but when i want to lay down and watch tv or something sometimes i put a bunny down sometimes i don't it's just it depends on your preference but if it's like daytime or something i really put my bunny down until i'm gonna go to sleep so when it's time gonna sleep i move on my other pillows out the way cuz they just a decoration you know and i sleep on my you know my said pillowcase or whatever you call it and um yeah i pretty much rest on my arm but like i said i still sleep coffee i don't sleep - like oh my god my hair done i can't get no sleep that's still wrist because i'll just worried about my hair the next day so aside from there i'm not really a wow sleeper anyway because when i wake up in the morning like i just worry about sleep is where i sleep it i'm just showing you different ways you can lay on your curls to keep them from getting messed up or whatever but i never have an issue with mine being flat or anything like that and if you don't want to sleep in a bun it just pull your curls up over your arm just like i just did and just lay that way but if you like to sleep in your bunny then do that these clips are pretty much self - explanatory so when i get up from a long day and i'm getting ready for school or whatever i check my boner doctor you see how the hair is pretty much kind of flat but the curls aren't fled the kurt the hurt the my hair as a whole is more phlegm down together but the curl itself isn't flint if that makes sense so all i do is pretty much take them all and i just flip flip flip i separate a few more of them that's why a lot of times where you hear me say don't separate your curls too much because you won't be able to separate throughout the week that's why when i do a fresh set only separate each curl once or twice because throughout the week i'm going to separate each curl even more that's what makes it last long but if you already separated yours five or six times you can't really do that so i take hold and spray and i spray it along my edges to kind of lay them down so i got new growth already like to use a gel because the jail is just wave up the new growth if that makes sense so it just depends on your preference each morning is different sometimes i'll really do anything sometimes i just put oil on it it fluff and i don't really separate the curls it just depends on you know what it's looking like it what i need that day so this had pretty much money time i heard throughout the week i just try to use the oil because the oil helps to eliminate the freeze and let me say this too since while i'm talking to y'all because i see it in intro it was friday i was licking roof because i do her on fridays so i just like get up and i get dressed and i just go you know to go ahead and do the peoples read i'm supposed to do just i was looking real for my intro don't judge me but okay so yeah this this clip is like i think later throughout the day or something i don't know as far as gonna go somewhere else but yeah i just work on my own fluff it to all helps to eliminate a lot of the fries that you get from throughout the week and another thing if you don't like to just put your bunny down directly and you want to kind of rest on your hair what you can do is i think they call it the pineapple method on youtube you flip your hair forward if you want a clip that you can but you can just flip your hair forward and put your bunny down that way but the reason i kind of don't like this method is because those curls in the back i find in my hair strains out right there the front of still be fine but this section that you flipping forward that you laying on it is a flip yeah that's how sleep on my hair yes i'll take care of my hair curls so i'll talk to ya later",

        "video_sub_title": "hey y'all welcome to my 2018 planner setup i know that it's march and i'm a little bit late in filming this for you guys but i wanted to make sure that i tried everything out and really found a system that worked for me before i filmed this and shared it with you all so i am currently loving my system it is a mix of digital and paper planning i'm gonna walk you guys through the whole thing let's get started so i've shared this with you guys in the past but i do use just the regular calendar app on my phone to keep track of all my appointments because i have meetings throughout the day and just a lot of different appointments going on i don't use a paper planner for keeping track of day to day appointments things move around sometimes i need to share my calendar whatever so i like digital for that and i will just use the app that's on my phone and it's nothing like extensive or anything too crazy if you guys have suggestions for calendar apps that you like let me know cuz i'd love to hear your suggestions but so far it's okay i don't like that i can't see my whole month like spread out you like you do in a paper planner you know what i'm talking about but for just like being on the go adding appointments moving things around my phone is great for that i'm using the iphone 10 i got it maybe like a month or two after it came out i'm really happy with it i'll do a different review on that because i still get questions about it i had the six plus i never had the seven or the 8 so i went from the six plus to this and i think it's great it's not like anything that i think you have to have but i do enjoy it so as far as my planning and organization goes i just use the calendar app on my phone all right let me actually do this big pink thing next so this is just a folder i'm just a regular like to pocket folder i keep papers in here and throw this in my purse i feel like even though the world is digital there's still like a lot of papers i have i might have like contracts for campaigns that i'm working on that i need to sign or documents that i need to review whatever it is so i just keep my papers in here and throw this in my bag all right now the fun stuff let me move to this first alright if you guys are my og followers and have been with me for a long time you know i go through planners like it's nobody's business i'm always trying different ones i never really settle on one thing i'm not a huge fan of rings i prefer spiral - bound planners and if you are new around here by the way welcome thank you for joining me please make sure that you hit that subscribe button because i make videos about all kinds of things related to organization planning wellness health we have a lot of fun around here so i'd love to have you join my community and join me on instagram all right like i was saying i've gone through a lot of different planners take some time and go through my channel watch some of my other planner setups you'll see i've used a variety of different methods if there's a system of organization out there i have tried it from bullet journals to ring round planners to erin condren i've tried them all and i'm just at peace with the fact that i like to try different systems i actually enjoy the process of moving from one planner to another i like writing out to - do lists so part of my planner piece is just being okay with trying different things i know that that's not for everyone if you are on the quest for the ultimate planner piece i do have a video about that and i'll link it down below for you okay so anyway i have tried the spiral - bound erin condren planners just wasn't a huge fan of the colors i don't like a lot of color so then i tried the black and white one that she had and it was just too big it was still too cutesy i wanted to be able to have a very chic and minimal and clean planner so i like to have a very blank slate because i want to be able to put stickers on it which by the way let me go off on a little tangent about my stickers i know that i've been telling you guys that i'm gonna stop selling them which i have pulled my stickers from like being able to order online but i still get tons of messages from you guys so i wanted to let you know if you want my stickers which if you have no idea what i'm talking about i've designed a line of very chic planner stickers if you want them if you go to my website and click stickers it'll take you to an album where you can view all the stickers and then all you have to do is message me with your paypal email i will invoice you and send you the stickers they are digital all right so that's the stickers and i again wanted something that was a very clean slate so that i could use stickers that i loved so when i found this erin condren monthly planner i was thought that that was it i was like i have found planner piece because the first few pages are just a month on one page very clean and simple layout and then in the back there's to - do lists for 52 weeks and i was like oh my gosh this is the best thing i could ever have this is what i'm gonna use for all of 2018 i custom - designed the cover so i just picked some of my favorite instagram photos just for fun and put them on there oh and this is my word of the year in case you missed that alright so i got it home literally all the pages are just falling out just the binding came apart and all my months came out so this is just a disaster i'm gonna do a full review on this i'm sorry i don't ever like to say anything bad about brands but this is just like unacceptable so anyway i can no longer use this as part of my monthly planning so again this is another reason why it took me so long to share this with you guys because i thought oh my gosh this is so fabulous but then it just like fell apart and i had to find a different system so i had to redo everything so anyway that is my erin condren monthly planner which i am no longer using all right now finally my system that i am using so like i said i'm using my phone digitally for appointments and then i just have my louis vuitton desk agenda and i've put a notebook in here which i'll take out and show you guys and then i'm back to this little monthly planner from sugar paper la via target it's very simple it's small as you can see like compared to the louis vuitton desk agenda it's small it is an academic year but it goes through or 2018 so i can use this for the rest of the year and honestly i just use this monthly planner for either editorial planning so i will plan out like if i have a campaign that i'm working with a brand for instagram or if i have a blog post that's due again as part of a campaign or i know that there's a certain month that has a theme that i want to try to plan content around that i'll kind of jot that down in here and then sometimes i keep track of my workouts in here sometimes i don't but for the most part i just use this as an editorial calendar and sometimes i use it for forward planning too so a trick that i like to do is take a sticky note and just put it in the month and then that way if i know something's going on either on a certain date i will just write it here or if i want to remember to follow up with someone so i'll just put a sticky note in here and then take all my notes for that month on here and then i'll try at the beginning of every month to then go and look at the following two months and see kind of what's happening in what's coming up so i do use this for forward planning but honestly most of my like appointments and dates and things that revolve around like a specific date are still done in my phone so then this notebook i just stuck in my louis vuitton agenda also side note i get a ton of questions about these stickers anya hindmarch is the best place to get leather stickers they are expensive but it's the best quality so i would definitely recommend checking that out so this notebook i just got from target i think i did have to kind of cut this back page a little bit so that it would fit in the flap of the desk agenda but it's literally just a notebook it does have two little dividers already built into it i love spiral bound notebook just because i can lay them flat so i use this for my daily to do's and just taking notes i have gone back and forth about a bullet journal i ordered that electrum liked rome whatever that is notebook i tried to make it a bullet journal it was just stressing me out too much with the like spreads and all that so i move to a much simpler design i can lay it flat i can fold it back on itself i've always been a spiral planner i always enjoyed those the most so yeah so i'm just using this to take notes and i like it i'm really happy right now with just having a very simple system so one thing that's missing from my system that i want to incorporate and maybe you guys can help me with is i've been working on doing monthly intentions and i share those on instagram so again connect with me there but i want to have a place that i can keep all of my intentions each monthly intention and that was another reason i was really attracted to the bullet journal because i wanted them to all be in one place but anyway that didn't work out so let me know if you have any ideas for how i can keep them together i'd love to somehow incorporate them in here there's just not a lot of space in here for me to write down my intentions i like to make them pretty and just like decorate a little bit so let me know if you have an idea for how i can keep track of my intentions so that's really it you guys pretty plain and simple i just moved out of this guy into a very simple little notebook put it all in my louis vuitton agenda i use this as an editorial calendar but mostly use my phone i've definitely calmed down a lot from the beginning of my planner days i still love the planner community and i love like looking at pretty planners and i love seeing the decorated pages i'm just kind of at a different space right now that's again another reason why i designed my own stickers because i wanted something that was very clean and simple and chic and so now i just kind of will use a sticker here there sometimes i like it to be pretty but i definitely use stickers for functionality my washi tape collection is almost non - existent and i will sometimes use washi to like block out dates in here if i'm traveling or something like that but for the most part it's not a very highly decorated planner system at all it's very very simple but i like it that way it's it works well for me it allows me to be a lot more productive and it's a lot more functional so anyway i hope you guys enjoyed that i know a lot of you have been asking me for an update on my planning system so i want to share it with you guys again like i said super simple mostly just using a notebook and not really using the bullet journal system just kind of writing daily to do's so i hope that's helpful for you guys if you are on a journey to get organized i've said this a million times i just really believe that writing things down and clearing your head not only helps you to get organized but can lead to a healthier life as well i think you get more motivated you sleep better you remember to do things more productive on and on the benefits
