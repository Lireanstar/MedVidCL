        "video_title": "How to Stop Enlarged Adenoids from Growing by using Buteyko Breathing",
        "video_sub_title": "hi my name is Robert Offerman I'm a breathing specialist with breathing center so you just found out that your child has swollen or enlarged adenoids and the doctors tell you that the only thing to do is surgery and you are looking on the internet because you want to find a natural alternative so here at the breathing Center that's what we do we teach people how to resolve their issues with swollen it swollen adenoids and tonsils using natural methods the reason why this occurs in the first place is because there's a there's a problem with the child's breathing the the child is breathing in a way that is causing these symptoms to arise so you need to understand a little bit about how the how the body works in order to understand what I'm saying in order for oxygen to be released from the blood and get into the cells of the body there needs to be a sufficient level of carbon dioxide and the way you breathe can affect the level of carbon dioxide in your body so for example if if your child is hyperventilating or breathing more than they should which is it often can be seen if they're breathing through their mouth or if they're breathing if their breathing is labored or noisy or if they're snoring at night that means that they're likely hyperventilating on some low chronic level so if that's the case what's happening there is their their bodies are becoming depleted of carbon dioxide and what happens then is that oxygen cannot be released from the blood and get to where it needs to go in the body you know including the brain the heart the kidneys deliver all the organs all the cells and tissues of the buf so that's obviously bad and one of the things that a lot of people don't realize is that your body is highly intelligent so when something goes wrong your body does something to fix it immediately because it needs to maintain its balance its homeostasis so one of the ways that your body responds to hyperventilation is to purposely narrow the airways in order to force a person to breathe less so in the case of a child with swollen adenoids what's happening there is the child is hyperventilating their body's not getting enough oxygen so it says hey I need to change something so it purposely swells the adenoid - which forces the child to breathe more slowly because it's a smaller passageway and this maintains some degree of homeostasis this can also be seen you know another example of a defense mechanism is with an ass maduk an asthmatic is also hyperventilating their body is not receiving enough oxygen so the body says hey stop hyperventilating I'm going to force you to stop and what it does is it purposely constricts the Airways in order to once again slow down the breathing so that carbon dioxide can be conserved and the homeostasis is maintained it's a way to fix that is obviously to address the problem with really if you can reverse the hyperventilation and we do that through various games and exercises that teach the child how to how to change their breathing then you make the defense mechanisms unnecessary so the body no longer needs to create these defense mechanisms to maintain the homeostasis so some other effects beyond the adenoids being that annoyed issue usually being resolved is that the child often becomes much much calmer and their attention is better and their focus is better because when you have oxygen in your brain it's much easier to focus and it's much more easy to pay attention and be alert and be active throughout the day too we have many many cases of children who after going through the program not only do they not have to get surgery for their adenoids which is usually confirmed by a doctor but they also their demeanor changes their appetite changes I have one one parent that I worked with who they told me halfway through the program that their child was eating more and she was gaining a little bit of weight too she was always on on the underweight side and that's one of the things that breathing can do it tends to have a normalizing effect on the entire physiology of the child not just on the adenoids it can really greatly strengthen a child's health and it's something that's really really worthy to do if your child has any sort of breathing issues and swollen adenoids are an indication of that some other indications of breathing problems are snoring sleep apnea if a child breathe breathe through the mouth that is a very obvious indication that he's hyperventilating or breathing too much because the mouth is a much larger opening than the nose so it's much easier to breathe more than you need to when you're breathing through the mouth so any mouth breathing any snoring any sleep apnea enlarged adenoids those are all good signs that you should really address the way that your child is breathing we have a program called adenoids without surgery and this program consists of eight weeks of working one-on-one with a breathing specialist usually we do one session per week about an hour and a half per session maybe more maybe less depending on what we have to cover that week and throughout the week you're in daily contact with your specialist through telephone and email during the sessions we educate the parents and the children about breathing and we use a lot of games in order to bring awareness to how you're currently breathing and also what you need to do to change it to breathe better to feel better so it ends up being something that will improve the health of the entire family and it kind of becomes a fun family project so if your child has any issues related to swollen adenoids or sleep apnea or mouth breathing or stuffy nose then I highly recommend that you have a consultation and discuss with the specialist if you would be a good candidate for our adenoids without surgery program if you'd like to set up consultation with one of our breathing specialists click the link below this video and it will take you to a page where you would register for the consultation after you do that a specialist will contact you shortly so click the link below and we'll see you soon",

        "video_sub_title": "[Music] hey everybody its Anita I am back I haven't done a video since February I think I've been in AI a and that's only because I've had some things going on I moved I don't know if you guys can tell the background is a little different my shoes my positives different so I can't display my shoes anymore but I figure time now anyway I'm here today because I am going to be making a quick weave wig and everyone I thought a video by a lady named I want to say her name is try CG and I'll post the link somewhere in the screen with her on her channel and the video that I'm referring to so that way you guys can see what I'm talking about and it's a video it's like a short kind of layer cut and it's using this hair let me show you right now with hair right here actually let me show you guys this one this color they only have one pack of this color so I have to get this one they're going to work together today anyway um just in case you're wondering about the hair that I'm wearing this is um this equal free tres equal lace front he's making in 1b and it's cold I know the lie I've been wearing it for probably about 3 weeks and this it's okay it's nothing exciting about it I got it because a lot of people were raving about it on into stuff said I'll give it a try and a few of the people that I saw that wore it was cute so I was like what the heck I'll go ahead and try it out whatever okay inside I've been fighting with these curls and trying to play around with it and everything but once I makes this new wig I'm hoping to retire this one for a little while so if you want to review on it let me know I'll do a review on it otherwise you can find the reviews on YouTube three tres equal make it okay alright so I'm to make this wig you're going to need two types of hair so like I said I have two of these is this old tree apple tree you try one of those I don't know is it the premium doobie this one is looks like this is a one being on its 100% human hair and it looks like this on the back there's any tails they're going to me Golu we're going to need a plastic shower cap y'all remember what I said about shower caps protects your hair from little and then you're going to need a stocking cap let me show you this black stocking cap a wig cap and scissors because as we're putting the tracks on we're going to cutting it and putting it around everything and so that iron it's effective in actually but I'll do that later because after we put the after we make the wig we're going to style it by flat ironing it and kind of bumping it a little bit bumping the curls a little bit so once again it's like when I did my other video about the juju hair so the three-quarter weight that I made I'm not going to go into a lot of detail about you know how I'll make the wig because I already have a video like that and and I'm just trying to keep this video short I want to keep it around 15 minutes I'm already well into 30 minutes almost 40 minutes right now so I'm going to speed it up when I I'm putting the tracks on and then I'll slow it down when I'm ready to start ironing it so I've never made a wig like this before I saw this lady's video I got inspired I said I want to try it so we'll see what it looks like together very missing again Phil wish me luck okay bye all righty stock and cap on one shower cap on one all right I got to show you guys what it looks like when you take it all back as with Nick around paper tears and numbers it is never to first but then I'm going to put the number two in the back because I don't want this is not the color that I've wanted so I'm going to put the same [Music] hey everybody I'm back and this is it okay so I gotta I'm going to try to curl this or bump it a little bit with my hands only adjust myself okay all right so just a little bit of feedback for myself I'm gone I'm going to because my hair under here my braids are all running out and everything so I need to rewrite my hair into here to flatten this out a little bit because to me it's looking kind of big at the top and that's that's constructive criticism that I'm giving myself because I know that this I know that this could look a little flatter but I'm you know I'm digging it so forth I think this is a fun summer hairstyle I don't know if I care too much about this part being in my face so I'm going to try to curl that I couldn't find my banana clips so I'm using these things [Music] I'm looking I'm using the camera as a mirror so I'll have my mirror right here forgive me if I'm a little young backwards and trying to touch this eye but I'm reaching over here and all that or maybe oof isn't over here oh okay so I'm tired and this is what its gonna be for now so I hope y'all liked it this is a doobie doobie I just see number two at the bottom one be at the top I like it I like it I hope you like it too i'ma play around with this I'm hoping I have a follow up video a follow up video with them well after I take a shower cap peel the shower cap off because I want to let this dry first and then I want to show you guys how it you know how I played around with it and everything maybe after like a week or so after a week of wearing it once the hair kind of on on the mouth once the hair kind of gets a little old because I don't know about you guys so sometimes I like when the hair gets a little bit old because it's easier to work with and it's not so bouncy which I'll think now let me know oh and this hair was only $15.99 a pack so this is like a thirty dollar hairstyle that you can do yourself and turn around so you guys can see the back now don't judge me because I don't know what the back look like cuz I didn't I haven't looked at the back at all sorry y'all you too hard on me okay I don't it's not as flat as I would like okay so I was going to EXCI the back okay can now see that all right so I never hear out a muffin rate comment and subscribe I hope you guys enjoyed this video and I'll see you guys in it I'll see your face which I again I'll see you guys yes [Music]",

        "video_title": "HAIR: How to get Vintage Style Curls without Heat!",
        "video_sub_title": "hi guys welcome to another video today I wanted to show you how I get them those nice curls I was wearing in some videos without heat so how I styled them without using any curling iron any flat iron and not even a hair dryer I kind of found this method by accident and I start really liking it because my hair is really dry at the end because I used to collide blonde a lot so I used to be a blonde haired girl and I had to stop it because my hair got really broke from all the bleaching so I started coloring it that again and I wanted to find a way how to style my hair really nicely without using too much heat my hair like naturally a dried like washed and not done a lot with it my hair looks like that and I'm going to show you how how you can get from that hairstyle to okay first Oh first you have to comb your hair really well make sure you don't have any tangles and then sorry I have to look in here because I have mirror there then you need to decide where you want your part I like when I do they do it curly I like to have the bat here on the side so calm that down really nicely like that and then I'm going to spray my hair a little bit with this liquid silk cloth hair repair from SWAT Co and if you pass the hair inside the hair cells I'm going to spray this clicking all over as you can see I have really really really thick hair that tends to be very friendly so I spread it and comb it through again and the important thing when doing this style or like trying to mold the hair into nice curls is that you don't try to do it with wet hair because if your hair is still wet it will not dry until the morning so your has to be nice 80 to 90 percent dry before you do it in the morning when we will wake up it gets dry and if you have really thin hair I would not recommend using something like this before I would recommend using this in the end I use it before so while I clip on it it keeps the hair from being frizzy if you have we thin hair it might be a good idea to do the next step and then spray it with hairspray next thing I'm going to take a hair band like this they should be very elastic II so you're comfortable to sleep on it on your head it should be quite a big one not one of those tight ones otherwise we'll hurt you and just put it on your head like that push out the back a little bit forward so your hair doesn't is too so the hair doesn't come out flat here make sure you have it nice where you have your part then it goes in here nice and then all you're gonna do is you take you start from the front and then all you're gonna do is you start from here take a strand of hair and put it with this thumb underneath see so you wrap it around the hip and then you take a next strand of hair and do the same thing wrap it around on the happened it doesn't have to be too neat because I don't want the neatest curls if you want me to curl comb it before you do it so it's more neat and the most thinnest ones you take the more bounce and tight the curls will be I like to help them pretty tight in the front so I'm not taking too thick hair strands so you see you see how this looks which is wrapping one strand after the other around the hairband and then when I get to this point I start doing it from this other side here so again I take the stand and put it through down let it another beat and then the next bit put it through like this and then another bit see and I'm going to show you from the back how I do the back okay then I take the next strut in the back I usually take a bit thicker strands wrap it around and then from that side take another strand wrap it around through it and again and try to keep those two parts to the sides you have more space here to finish all your hair and then you take in the end you take the last bit lift it their habit you put them through and again and you just tuck it in here all your hair is tucked in nicely like that so it's all finished now all my hair targeting quite tight I'm going to get quite tight curls and I'm going to get them here like upwards and here out what if you don't want them so tight take thicker strands and pull them when you finished a bit out so they're not so tight so this is how it looks and sometimes when I wash my hair in the morning I do this in the morning when I go out like this as a hairstyle and I let it dry a whole day like that and then I sleep on it also so the next day are gonna have really nice curls but today I wash my hand evening's I'm not going out like that and I'm gonna sleep on it and I'm gonna show you how I take it out tomorrow I already put on my clothes and did my makeup for the day I slept on this hair one night so in the morning it looks a bit messy like that but it doesn't matter at all I'm gonna show you now how to take it out and how to style the curls if you have really thin hair that doesn't hold curl very well I would recommend spraying it now with a lot of hairspray before you take it out but as my hair is really speaking frizzy anyhow it holds the turns very well so I'm not going to do that so basically you just pull the elastic band we put around our head the one you slept on just pull it out and carefully release the curls loosen it a bit of oil first and then just carefully pull up your hair so you basically wake up with that and it takes very little time in the morning to take out this hairband and style it and have a great hair and keep the sink like if you spend like an hour in the morning doing your curls last bit so they have your hairband and how you left with something like that as you can see they're very tight curls and they start more in the bottom they don't have a lot of reset on what we're gonna do now is comb it all just be careful if you have really had to be to keep the face and in order to keep the fries what you can do is comb your hair around your hand to form the curls this is a technique as you see you comment around your hand and then it forms the curl even better in this is a technique used by winters hairstyling if you do pin curls if you also take the pins out and then you comb your hair around your hand so they don't get your hair doesn't get free you see it forms automatically around my hand to make a curl and as I said if you want less class just on youthful thin strands of hair youth biggest ones just to get away and don't leave it overnight just maybe leave it a few hours then after you combed it very well use some hair oi I like to use beauty or even this one which is a plus today I'm going to use this one it smells a little bit better put the tiny amount you put it through the ends of your hair so they keep away from fries all over the day that's actually my biggest problem freeze and after you finished with the combing and they're putting the oil in your hair all you need to do is style it the way you want it you know you cannot put like hairband and leave this front curl a bit out and put a hairband on this side or put them all back like that and put a heaven on top of this on top of the hair looks like this or you know play around with the pads take this side and pin it up with a little thing like that just come and look like this you know use different hair bands I also have this feather one on different hair clips I also have this one or like take on the hair and put half of the hair up and half of the hair down you can even kiss the back a little bit but today I'm just going to take this big girl here in the front and I'm just going to put it up like that to this side and keep it with a little clip yeah so that's my hair styling for today which looks like this and thanks so much to all my subscribers I really appreciate all the support and all the nice comments and hope to see you soon and hope that you like it bye guys",

Suresh Babu senior consultant ent head and neck surgeon working with the Apollo Hospitals ba\u00f1o [Music] a Frankel is nothing but a simple boil or a pimple happening inside the year right so a pimple or boil can happen as we all know in any part of the body where there is a hair follicle or sweat glands right if you take the year you you have hair follicles all around the pinna and if you look at the hole that leads to the eardrum that what we call ear canal they're only the outer 1/3 is having the hair follicles and sweat glands so a fall Fraenkel or a pimple can occur very much there and it's like any other pimple it has to be treated the only difference here is that since the skin is very tightly adherent or attached to the cartilage the soft bone part of the pinna then it is a lot more painful a lot more symptomatic than the other pimples if you look at the year the pinna has a lot of hair follicles as we all can observe right as well the the ear canal the hole which leads to the ear drum that also has a bit of follicles and sweat glands especially in the outer 1/3 of the length that's about seven or eight millimeter length so a foreign Collura boilie can happen in this area and it will be a lot more painful whereas a pimple on the face or anywhere else is not so painful because the skin is loose it is not attached to any structures in the ear the skin is very tightly adherent or attached to the cartilage that is the soft bone of the year and that is why the moment there is any stretching happening there is tremendous pain so it is a lot more symptomatic than the temporal elsewhere so I it has to be treated like any other pimple you have to use antiseptic creams you have to use painkillers and in a rare case if you suspect the pimple worsening then an antibiotic also will come in play right a local application of heat also will help you the very end you apply a hot water bag around the year so that will soothe Andy the pain sensation now you can apply creams antiseptic cream with the help of q-tip or an earbud and gently pushing the cream into the ear canal and that will spread around and give you a relief right and coming to the point where whether we can break it or not when it is nice and pointing like you see a white blob like thing which is filled with pus then the skin around that is totally dead and insensitive so that you can remove it but not well formed or a premature boil or fur ankle should not be touched or dealt with because then you are actually opening a normal skin which is still viable and may creating a wound in a septic area which will worsen the situation and sometimes the infection can even spread around and make it a lot more complicated rather than helping in any way so a pointing pus can be removed rain but not fully formed for uncle like I said earlier the hair follicles and sweat glands are there only in the outer part of the ear canal so there is no chance of you getting any boil in the middle ear or inner part of the year right they as they don't have any follicles you are not liable to get any of these things and if you have any infection or pain or pass formation from the deeper part of the year it only means that the pathology is something else so it has to be looked at by a specialist and has to be treated appropriately [Music]",

        "video_sub_title": "start off with a clean already primed I hear is my clean bear I just have a little bit of concealer on and I'm using that s primer next I'm going to use an eyeshadow base that's really really going to make that red that we're using stand out so I'm using Mac's chroma line and the color is basic red so it is exactly what it is just a matte creamy red eyeshadow base I'm going to take a little bit of that with my finger and Pat that right onto my eyelid try not to overextend that red pasture crease so basically as you can see right below where my sock my eye socket is it doesn't go any higher than that I'm going to take my sugar pill burning heart palette and this red color all the way down at the bottom this is love plus if you don't have the sugar pill palette all you basically need is just a bright red matte eyeshadow so this isn't absolutely no shimmer in it it may look like it because the camera is kind of picking that up but it's just a regular matte eyeshadow I'm going to use my Mac 239 brush and Pat that color right on top where we apply that red base and this is really gonna make red pop in a way that you have never seen it before so it's really great to pair like colors alike if you want to make a blue eyeshadow stand out use a blue base a green eyeshadow to stand out you might want to use a green base and so on and so forth so I'm just padding that red on packing it on and once again not extending it past my eye crease on my eye socket so basically right in that area I'm leaving it bare and for that immediate area right above my right above where we applied that red I'm using texture eyeshadow by Mac and this is basically just a brown eyeshadow that's neutral to my complexion so you're more than welcome to use whatever crease color works for you I'm just blending that right into my crease and buffing out any harsh lines that the red may have made right underneath my brow bone I'm going to use this highlight this is basically a really nice satin texture eyeshadow there's no shimmer and you don't want the brow bone highlight color that you use to take away from the bright corners that we're using so that's why I chose bisque I'm going to take a little bit of that right underneath my brow bone and it's just a very neutral plain brow bone color that I like to use for my simple it looks such as this one the next thing I'm going to do is I'm gonna start working on the bottom portion of my eye I'm going to take an NYX jumbo pencil and this color is milk it's basically just a matte my face and I'm going to apply some of that in my waterline just gently gently very little you don't really have to layer it on and then I'm also gonna take some of that on my bottom lash line and all you have to do is really just apply it in one spot and take your finger and blend the rest out and if your eyelashes are any wear like mine anywhere close to like mine you'll end up with being on the lashes but just don't really worry about that I'm going to take a Mac pigment this is pink bronze pigment by Mac it's basically kind of like a coral it's got a little bit of pinkish to it orange coral I'm going to take that pigment pigment and a flat liner brush using a little bit of product I'm going to put that in my waterline and I'm using minimal product because you really don't want to get this stuff in here all right when I get pigment in my eye it doesn't really bother me too much but once again this isn't something that I would do every day I mean every once in a while for a fun pop of color it's nice using your paper towel wipe off some of that pigment that we just used so that it's somewhat clean I'm going to go back to my sugarpill palette and poison plum which is this deep eggplant matte purple eyeshadow down there and I'm going to take a little bit of that on my liner brush and that's going to be the color that's going on my bottom lash line still working with a thin palette I'm taking the bright matte yellow this is butter cupcake by sugarpill and I'm going to use a pencil brush this is the 219 pencil brush by Mac just to get right in that inner corner area I'm gonna really need a small brush that's gonna really let you get into little corners like that now we're pretty much done with the eye shadow next I'm going to apply a liquid liner this is ultra liner by Maybelline it's waterproof and it's got a patent black shine it's probably one of my favorite liquid liners you are more than welcome to use whatever you choose I think adding liquid liner makes this a little bit less editorial looking and makes it a little bit more everyday wearable even though you don't really see a lot of people wearing red eyeshadow I mean who's to say you can't you know wear this to a carnival or a festival a party a themed colorful parties oh there we go online our eyes are lined the final step if you're not wearing eyelashes would be just to add mascara I'm using Maybelline's lash Leto which is one of my signature favorite mascaras sure you work some of that shadow that gets into the lashes out and really really darken them out so there is our final I look I hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial thank you very much for watching",

        "video_title": "Reading With Dyslexia | The Easy Way",
        "video_sub_title": "Oh what up dyslexia nation my name is new Shanta I'm a dyslexic science teacher I teach here in the Southern California area and in this video we're gonna be talking about how to read with dyslexia now this video is going to be split up into three parts and I'm gonna put the timestamps in the description below so if you want to skip to any of the parts you can just refer to that now the first part of this video is gonna be about what reading is for in this section I'm gonna talk to you guys about the first principles of reading section 2 or part 2 is gonna be all about how reading is done it's three ways and I'm gonna cover all three of those in part three I want to talk to you about my personal reading system I think this is the best system for dyslexics to use in order to read accurately with speed and also for enjoyment in this video I want to give you the first principle understanding of what reading is and what it's for by understanding what reading is it's gonna give you a framework that you can use to really master reading very quickly and first principles are basically the fundamental building blocks that make up a thing so if we go back and we think about our ancestors our ancestors invented reading and writing so they can communicate with each other but before they can communicate with each other they needed to invent language and language is made up of words a words are just sounds humans make with their mouths and these sounds represented the thoughts inside the minds of the humans who spoke words so the basic idea of communicating is to be able to transfer thoughts between human models it's a kind of telepathy being able to take the ideas in your head and transfer it to someone else's head it's kind of cool and reading is a type of communication where you're transferring ideas and the concepts from outside your mind into your mind and that's all it is once we understand that reading is just a way to transfer information into your mind you can kind of let go of all the stories that we have around reading so they mention of reading really unlocked like this really cool superpower humans before they mentioned of like you know written language humans were only able to communicate with people that were in the same place and in the same time as them because they had to use words and sounds to transfer their thoughts into another person's thought but reading and writing really unlocked the ability for information to go to travel through time and also to travel through space let me just give you an example what I'm talking about here so if I was eight if I had a cool idea and I knew how to read and write I can write that run on a piece of paper or on a cave somewhere or on a blog or what in some material and I can take that material and I can send it to a different place like a different village or across the across the country or across a continent or even across the ocean and another cool thing about that type of communication is that that the object can be preserved through time so if I wrote a book now that book could be read a hundred years from now by someone I haven't even met so that information can travel through space and it can travel through time so there really that's three types of reading the first type of reading is called I reading this is typically what we think of as reading in our society and in schools this is when we look at a piece of text with our eyeballs and our eyes send a signal to our brain and our brain decodes those symbols on that page as words with meaning the second type of reading is called finger reading and infinite reading what you're doing is using your fingers this is also known as Braille what you're doing is you're using your fingers to feel bumps on a page and your fingers send a signal to your brain and your brain decodes those different textures and bumps as words with meaning and the third type of reading is called your reading and this is my favorite type of reading and it's the it's the best type of reading for dyslexics it's when your ears hear sounds and those sounds get decoded by your brain as words with me as you can see all these types of readings all three different types of readings serve the same exact function they get information from outside your brain into your brain so here's the thing our society and our institutions like schools have a huge bias towards like eye reading and it's not because like I reading is like apparently better than ear reading or finger reading it's just because of the economics of mass-producing books now humans have been making books since the 1700s so we've created systems around textbooks so because books were so easy to produce in the past it kind of makes sense that our school systems are kind of based around eye reading because it's like it was the technology that everyone had access to but I think the economics are changing like the cost of producing a book and the cost of producing audio file or a video or a Braille book is about the same because of how the internet works so we need to start updating our school systems and we need to start updating the way we get information into our brain so my reading system is totally based around your reading and there's three reasons why I prefer your reading over anything else so the first reason is the fact that you know written language has only been around for about 5,000 years and you know it's a relatively new skill and our brains probably didn't evolve to read and get information through our eyeballs in the way that we created written language so it doesn't really fit the way our brain works it's like a skill that takes a long time to learn so it's not natural to us but verbal language has been evolving for millions of years you know even animals are able to recognize sounds and even communicate using cells so it comes naturally to us it's much easier for us to do so the second reason why I prefer ear reading to anything else is because II reading kind of removes the disadvantages of being a dyslexic in the process of reading and it also kind of supports the advantages of being dyslexic as well the third reason I prefer reading to anything else is because of how convenient it is I'm able to read faster I'm able to retain more of the information and I'm able to do other activities that support me reading while I'm reading for example I can take notes while I'm reading I'm able to draw pictures while I'm reading I'm able to little artifacts that can help me with like retrieving the information after I read it so and I'm also able to read at a much faster rate than normal people if I speed up the reading as well well go into more of that in the next section on my reading system itself so this is my rating system is split up into two parts the first part is like my mind set how I think about reading and the second part is like the exact mechanics of how I go about reading with my ears when I approach reading I think of it in the first principle terms so the objective of what reading is we kind of talked about it in the beginning of this video is you're trying to get information into your head and that's the main thing that you should be concerned about it's not about like using a very specific way that you're that society tells you to read it's not about feeling guilty about not being able to read using your eyeballs it's not about any of that stuff it's not about the stories that go like that's around reading it's it's about getting information into your head and that's a really powerful way to think about it because if that's your goal there's a lots of different ways that you can go about doing that another thing that is really important to thing to know is that you don't actually have to finish what you're reading so there's these like ideas about like if you start a book you got to finish it don't do that because you're just gonna like be stuck on reading one book for like months and months at a time because you can't get through it there's too many good books especially if you're reading for your own like enjoyment if you're reading for your like to gain information you shouldn't get stuck on books i if the moment I get bored with the book I just immediately put it away and you know I might come back to it in a couple of months or a couple years but that's really important you want to go with your interest you want to go with what makes you like feel good about reading you wanna it's like and eventually you'll be able to get through really difficult books because your skill at this thing and also your like background knowledge in different areas will kind of help you understand difficult material so if you can't understand something or if you are having it like if you're bored with something immediately get rid of it because that's not gonna help you develop a reading habit and developing a reading habit is more important than reading books that you know that someone else told you to read and I understand sometimes you gotta read things for school but if it's for your own benefit it's just just get rid of it you don't need to so how you read something should be determined by like why you're doing that thing so for me that I only read for three reasons I read to learn I read for entertainment and I read to fall asleep so when I'm reading to learn things I always read with I always ear read and I always read with a journal with a pencil or a pen now write down things I make brain storms I do spider diagrams after hours - like that that really helps me like put information into my head and keep it there and recut like retribute maneuver I want to retrieve it and it helps me like really learn the thing much faster than if I was just reading and taking notes on the on the margins or whatever because I can take a really detailed note while I'm listening and I can write questions I'm gonna do a bunch of things that I'm unable to do if I'm giving all my attention to reading the words and using my eyeballs the second thing the second way I read is - for entertainment and when I'm reading for entertainment I'm usually doing a puzzle or I'm like walking around doing chores and because it's because I'm using my ears to read I can do that and I get a lot of pleasure from doing that because doing multiple activities that kind of like keep me in a flow State and I'm like really enjoyed the content especially if it's like you know a story or something like that and then the last way I read the rats reason I read is to fall asleep and I've made a video called using dyslexia to sleep and this has been a hack I've been using is sometimes I have a hard time sleeping and the thing that I do every single time that I need to fall asleep within like 30 minutes is I get a Kindle and I read with my eyes and reading with my eyes makes me so tired by like you know if I read for like 30 40 minutes it puts me out so quickly because I'm like mentally exhausted and yeah so those are three ways that I read and for each one I use a different strategy so you should like figure out why you're reading and then that Y should determine how you're gonna read sometimes you might have to use I reading for me I want to feel mentally fatigued exhausted I I go to irony because I'm a dyslexic and it's gonna use a lot of my mental resources to do that so it's gonna make me fall asleep and make me tired faster so the last thing I wanna talk to you guys is about like the actual mechanics of reading so when I'm trying to read a book like a novel or a nonfiction book I always go to audible and I downloaded off audible and I figured out a way a system to like speed listen to books a lot fast and if you guys want to check out that I'll put a link at the end of this video the second type of thing I read is like articles from like the internet and like physical books that if someone gives me a book that's in text I need to be able to read that too so this the way I read physical books and articles on the Internet is something using something called speechify and I'll put a link to that video here and the link to speed reading or speed listening here so click on these videos if you want if you're interested in that thanks so much you guys I love you talk to you soon bye [Music]",

        "video_title": "How to Treat Gout Flares during the COVID-19 Crisis",
        "video_sub_title": ">> I'm Dr. Ted Fields at the Hospital for Special Surgery, talking to you about how to treat gout flares in the setting of our viral crisis. First of all, as always with gout, you want to treat the flares quickly. We know that it's like a book of matches, if the whole book is lit, after days it's hard to put it out. One match that's lit is easier to put out. So start the treatment early. In general, you can use the same treatments that you usually use. We know that some people use colchicine for flares. And that should be fine in the era of Covid-19. Some people use anti-inflammatory medications, such as Advil or Aleve, or prescription versions of those. As far as those go, in France they had put out a recommendation that people who have Covid-19 should use acetaminophen, Tylenol, rather than ibuprofen. However, acetaminophen is not anti-inflammatory, so that if you have a gout flare, you're probably going to need something like Advil or Aleve, if that's something that you usually use. So there was nothing that was found that was particularly bad about ibuprofen in the setting of Covid-19. It's just that in general it's a safer drug than acetaminophen, if you have a choice, for example, to treat fever. So you can go ahead and use the anti-inflammatories, if that's what you use. There are people who can't take them, because they've got particular GI problems or kidney problems. And that's something that, hopefully, you've worked out with your doctor already. Or you may need to speak to your doctor about it now. Now, what about prednisone? Some people use prednisone for gout flares. Some people need to use prednisone for gout flares because the other choices, like Advil and colchicine, don't work out for them, because they can't tolerate them, or they have other medical problems. If that's you, then probably prednisone will still be the right thing for you to use in the era of Covid-19. However, prednisone does make you more susceptible to infection. So we do try to be careful about prednisone. So unless you absolutely know from your physician that you don't have a choice other than prednisone, you probably should talk to your internist or rheumatologist before taking prednisone for a gout flare. However, if you start quickly, often you can get away with only taking the prednisone for a day or two. So the risk is pretty low. But it's reasonable to talk to your doctor in this era of viral concern about prednisone in this setting. So if you have a gout flare, treat early. Use your colchicine, if that's what you use. Use your anti-inflammatories, if that's what you've already been told to use. Talk to your doctor, if you need to use prednisone. And that will be the way to get rid of your gout flare as quickly as possible. Don't forget also to take your long-term gout medications, such as allopurinol or febuxostat, brand name Uloric, and to stick with your diet. Thank you.",

        "video_title": "Treating labral tears, shoulder instability and impingement syndrome non-surgically",
        "video_sub_title": "[Music] hi i'm danielle madis at caring medical and next to me is my associate dr brian hutchinson we're going to talk today about shoulder pain which is a very common condition that we see at the office and you know as you may agree a lot of times patients will come in with chronic shoulder pain you know they've had it for years maybe they've had an mri you know maybe been diagnosed with common things you know like a rotator cuff tear or a labral tear or a shoulder impingement and looking for alternatives to surgery i'm sure you see a lot of those cases as well all the time all the time yeah and um when we assess cases like that a lot of times you know myself as a prolotherapist and dr brian as a chiropractor we'll evaluate patients together you know i'll take a look at um maybe some ultrasound findings you know looking at the rotator cuff tear or their ligaments you know assessing the stability of their shoulder and dr brian might look at their shoulder position in relation to their neck and you could talk a little bit more about that definitely yeah we'll look just to make sure that there's there's function that the joint is free um you know one really neat thing that we can do is sometimes the patient will get limited like right about here and so one thing we can do is we can reposition where that humerus is and they'll end up getting a little bit more mobility but then we want to also assess if there's stability would you agree that the shoulder um either the ac joint so where your collarbone and your shoulder blade meet or even that glenohumeral joint the kind of quote-unquote ball and socket are easy joints that sublux definitely the shoulder is it not the most mobile joint in the entire body so your shoulder has the most range of motion out of any joint in your body and therefore when you have more range of motion you have a greater ability to have instability or to get excessive motion so yes definitely yeah so a lot of you know i said ball and socket even before and a lot of people think of the shoulder like that but really you know if you think about the the glenohumeral joint it's not like this ball with this socket that kind of encloses it it's really more like this golf ball on a tee you know there's not a big bony kind of socket to hold it in place but instead you have this labrum this kind of suction cup that suctions that ball in there and then on top of that you have a whole network a whole series of ligaments that make up a capsule that hold it together so when people develop shoulder instability like dr brian said what that means is that those ligaments have become less like they're this rubber band that's been stretched out and it's just kind of stayed that way and what it does when someone develops that is it puts a lot of strain on the other tissue like that labrum has to work so hard to hold you know these bones in place because the ligaments just aren't able to do it or your muscles have to spasm and tighten trying to create that stability which then puts more pressure on your rotator cuff tendons so would you say that typically if somebody gets a labral tear that there might have been some kind of ligamentous hypermobility or instability that usually would precipitate that unless it was a traumatic real one time so what i tell patients a lot um if they have a labral tear is you know that labrum is the innermost soft tissue yeah what are the chances that you would injure that innermost soft tissue and not injure any of the tissues that lay around it yeah that makes sense very slim or if somebody has you know this joint instability they've had for years they've had all this pressure on their labrum you know it might just be one thing and all of a sudden their label tears from too much pressure and a lot of patients will you know ask about surgery or maybe they were recommended for surgery but really you know surgical procedures tend to kind of tack down that labrum they don't address the ligaments and they lick they make that labrum less pliable so you're more likely to tear it especially if you're like to be active if you're an athlete or even if you're like a grandparent taking care of grandkids you know you're going to be much more likely to tear that labrum if one if the ligaments aren't addressed and two if it's if it's tacked down and not pliable definitely yeah so working collaboratively working together is really a huge benefit when it comes to shoulder problems and you know the shoulder joint being the most mobile joint in the body is so prone to getting instability and i can tell you personally that i actually have some shoulder joint instability in mind danielle is in my acromioclavicular joint and so the reason that i got it was from doing handstand push-ups with basically a bar so that i could go deeper than normally just down to my head so i i was in chiropractic school at the time still learning didn't know that i was going to cause this problem luckily i worked with danielle so hopefully i can get this corrected but you know shoulder is just it's so mobile that it's really easy to get instability and it can end up causing neck pain it can cause other problems so and another you know people um oftentimes say oh i have impingement you know and just to kind of point back to this graphic behind us there are a couple different types of impingement um one we'll call down here is called internal impingement um where actually like that you see like this bone is kind of hitting this bone you know where these um red graphic is and that can happen again if that ligament or you know right here this joint capsule is stretched out where that bone just kept hitting that other bone which can be painful or you can have a rotator cuff injury that causes impingement so here you'll see um like this so here right here is your ac joint and then you have the space uh between you know where that capsule is for that glenohumeral joint in there you'll have your like some rotator cuff um tissue like your supraspinatus tendon right here let's say that tendon gets inflamed it gets torn what will happen is it will swell and it will get thicker and so then whenever you move your arm to the side just kind of move your arm out and decrease that space naturally it's going to pinch on that tendon and impinge it which is very painful and that would be another case we're working collaboratively with myself or dr houser and dr brian would be helpful or just even in general making sure you get a comprehensive exam possibly an ultrasound exam to look in and see what's really happening so you could be best treated [Music] you",

        "video_sub_title": "what's up guys it's Ross and this video is going to be all about eyebrows it's so crazy to think that one of my very first videos was on eyebrows for Maine and it has been so popular now that I've been doing to do for thinking about like five almost six years it's time to make a new one because believe me the way I do when I was now is much different than before so today I'm at supply mines here in Los Angeles California with Angel and Angel is my eyebrow whiz when you guys call each other your eyebrows eyelid I was okay well I'm okay eyebrows stylist and angels I'm doing my eyebrows for a long time and he truly is a master at his work so today we're going to show you and do a quick demonstration of how I do my eyebrows but first I want to just discuss some of the new techniques of guys when using to see their eyebrows and what is currently trending because I know you've heard the term eyebrows on beak and that's what we're trying to accomplish today so tell me a little about three well ready needs up technique where you remove hair doesn't drain ancient technique the Middle Eastern technique and it's pretty popular not here in the United States yeah I remember people you see through our bus tour didn't mall like now it's like a teenager it's so freaking weird who would do that but now that I do myself I would probably do that yeah definitely is the best way to do it why is it better than say tweezing or waxing well training gives you the chance to sculpt the eyebrow little by little as opposed to doing one for you know lying and then you get fool you know this it's more precise so again you give a better shape to the client than waxing or three okay and I remember the first time that give my eyebrows you mentioned something about it doesn't pull the skin as much like that really worked it doesn't hold it again it only just pull the hair out and kick it out of the follicle same as a tweezer but it takes it can take a whole row you can go little by little yeah lets you design the eyebrow yeah and I think that's really important especially for the eye area where the skin is really delicate and kind of sensitive we don't want to be putting hot wax on that area and then ripping it off I've never had my eyebrows waxed and though I think that's probably especially for guys grain I think is better because we don't thin the brow you know as much as waxing like you're waxing there's more chances to make the eyebrows thinner than what them with reading your kitchen school law when they also live less chances that you can make an eyebrow pen especially for the guy all right so let's just jump into this guy's we're gonna change things up a little bit we're going to do my eyebrows I'm also going to show you one other thing that I love to do when I'm here and that's eyelash tinting and all that does is just make your eyelashes a little bit darker it's like dyeing your eyelashes and it just makes your eyes pop and it doesn't look like I think that when people see my eyelashes tinted they can't quite put the finger on what I've done differently it doesn't look like mascara or I can wear makeup but it just makes my eyelashes a bit darker so my eyes palette I love love love that so let's just jump in this guy's and we'll start the tutorial hey guys so here I am sitting in angels chair clearly very excited to be here angel always starts off just by putting a little powder on my brow this just helps the thread grip a little bit better next he'll comb through my brows just to see exactly what with now honestly angel doesn't need any direction but when it comes to my brows I just want a more structured look this means cleaning up the edges giving it a nice defined outline now the first thing you'll notice is that I'm holding my skin taut with my hands this is really important because as he's using the thread to remove the hair we don't want it to be pulling on the skin too so the way we avoid that is just by keeping the skin taut now as you can see when he's actually threading my brows every time he rolls the thread across my skin it's removing hair and what you can see is him removing all the fine little hairs on my eyelid and above my eyebrow that's what important because that's what helps the skin look nice and smooth and keep the focus on your eyebrows now I know you guys are probably wondering if this is painful or not and I'm not going to lie it does hurt a little bit I even teared up a little bit during this recording I don't know the best way that I can describe it is like little electrical shocks each time that he rolls the thread across my skin but honestly the whole process doesn't take a lot of time and for the results it's totally worth it because you only need to do this about once a month hang on how quickly your hair dries back and you can maintain the results in between just by tweezing any stray hairs at micro back all right guys this brow is almost finished the whole thing only took a minute or two angels just going through and pulling off any peach fuzz and baby hairs that might be hanging out and of course taking care of that unibrow nobody wants a unibrow and that's the finished look as you can see the bottom border especially is really nice and defined um it doesn't look overdone by any means it just has a nice structured and clean look now angel will go back and take a little big pair of scissors just to clean off any stray hairs I do not recommend trimming your eyebrows but since angels afro I do let him do it sometimes if you trim too much it can lead to coarse eyebrows so this next part is totally unnecessary but I do love getting it done this is the eyelash tint now angel goes in first just by putting a protective paper on my lower lid and then on my upper lid there's already like a protective cream and then he has this blue black gel that he paints on my eyelashes all this is going to do is just dye my lashes a darker color making them look nice and bold it's great for guys for that reason exactly it's my own natural lashes they're just a little bit darker so it gives your eye more of a dramatic look the effect is going to last about two weeks maybe a little bit longer and it's really not expensive that's why I always have angel do it whenever he does my eyebrows alright guys so this is the final product as you can see my brows are very clean and my eyelashes are darker now I still have a little bit of the like done like Romo high but it'll wash off and then of course my skin's layer to from the reading threading but I love how it looks and thank you I do like together are in the olive oil or the Los Angeles area stop by sublime eyes ask for angel to hook you up he's a good steward right huh you're the owner I'm the owner he's the owner so Gary eyebrows done by the owner and the pro and we're right here on Sunset Boulevard so thank you so much for watching and we'll see you soon",

        "video_sub_title": "with a pie chart in Excel you can see a representation of the total amount and then the percentage that each value has of that total it might be easier to compare the values if you create a bar chart such as this one which easily shows the difference between each region or in a column chart like this one but if you need to create a pie chart we'll see the steps for creating one that's easy to read and presents the data as clearly as possible the first step is to set up the data on this sheet I have the names of four regions and in the column to the right the numbers which represent the sales in each of those regions a pie chart can only show one set of numbers so we couldn't compare year-to-year for each region but we can see the total sales for the current year to create the chart I'm going to select any cell in this table and on the ribbon I'll go to the insert tab and click pie and I'm going to select this first pie chart which is just a simple pie chart I don't want an exploded pie or a pie of pie and certainly not a 3d pie because those can distort the data with the way that they create angles I'm going to click this one and it puts a chart right in the middle of the worksheet you can move it and you can resize it and to move it just point to one of the borders or point somewhere and you'll notice where I'm pointing a pop-up says chart area so if I point there I can drag it to the right or left I can also make it smaller by pointing to one of the handles on the sides or in the corner pull the handle in or pull it out to make it bigger we have colored slices on this pie and a legend tells us what each color represents and to read that people have to look at the color here and then try and find it in the legend so it's better if you have these labels right on the slices or just beside them so we're going to get rid of this legend and put data labels on to the pie now this pie only has four slices shouldn't try to show too much in a pie chart or we'll just get so crowded you won't even be able to read it so with this pie chart I'm going to right-click and click add data labels and that puts the value we can see the values here and it's just put that on each slice so it's a start it's not telling us what region it is yet but we're going to fix that up in a minute next I'll delete this legend because we're not going to need it I'll right-click on the legend and click delete that shifts the pie over into the center and now we have a little more room to put things on to the slices I'll right-click on one of these labels and format data labels in this format data labels window label options is selected and I have checkboxes that I can use to put things on to the label I don't want to put too much or it'll just be crowded and hard to read right now it's showing the value I could also add the percentage so for this slice it shows 400 as the value a 35% of the total value I would also like to see the region name so I'll check category and I'm going to take out the value and just leave it with the region name and the percentage I can also position those labels right now it came up the default is best fit so it will put that label where it has most amount of room you could put them in the center of each slice the inside end outside or best fit and I'll close this window now I'm going to do a little more formatting on these labels so they're easier to read so I'll right click and in this formatting ribbon I'm going to choose a white font because it will provide a better contrast with the dark background I'll make those labels bold and maybe go up a little in size so you can experiment as I point to each size it shows what it will look like so 12 might be a little too big maybe go with 11 so now you've got a pie chart where everything is easy to read the labels are right on the slice so you don't have to look back and forth from a legend to try and figure things out though it's a good representation of the data for more excel tips and tutorials and to download the sample file for this video please visit my context choose website at WWDC um",

        "video_sub_title": "hey everyone so today I'm gonna do a chit check here we do with me and I already have my face makeup on because I am filming a first impression of the Stila stay all day I think it's called foundation what should already be out by now so I will link it down below if you want to see this foundation review first impression thing I was looking through my videos and one of my absolute favorite makeup looks I've ever done I didn't actually judge tutorial 4 but I worded in a few videos and it was using my Mick blue brown pigment and I am in love I just love the look and so I decided I would recreate that I should have look and face looking everything and I want to try it with a few different lip colors as well I experiment what looks good with it so I hope you guys enjoy this video and this was super highly requested a lot of people wanted to see the makeup look and just quickly I did do a different tutorial using blue brown pigment but I mixed it with different colors and I'll link that down below as well because it's one of my favorite makeup looks I've ever done so yeah definitely look down below after you watch this video and she kept those two videos so first of all I'm gonna do my eyebrows because yeah I just need to yeah so I'm using my hands tight and I can't say this wood and Stacia beverly hills dipbrow pomade and blunt and then you want to take any brown base or something similar so this is a cream color base and it's called mid-tone sepia so it's just like a sepia color so brownish won't turn brown I'm just using a round top cleaned up from exo Beauty and applying that all over that doesn't have to be too tidy because now you're going to go over that with a brown eyeshadow so I'm just using a I should I blend a brush and you can take any Brown so I'm just going to mix these two from the Naked basics palette and then just buff that all over your lid and blend it out I'm also going to do a little bit underneath I'm gonna use my tape it I should have brushed my favorite highlighting brush it I'm going to take that top color which is called Venus I'm gonna highlight my brother in my inner corners as well and then I'm gonna take my pigment blue Brad by Mick this is probably my favorite two pigment along with copper Sparkle I'm just taking the little cap off and I'm gonna use what's in there so just using um the same blending brush and I'm just going to tap that in there you want to tap off these the lows will go everywhere and then I'm just petting that first on the lid and you don't need much ELISA is a pigment this sort of intense so beautiful and then I'm just gonna start bleeding that out along the lid and it's the crease a little bit and then I remember wearing this with winged eyeliner so I'm gonna do that and if you don't like eyeliner just skip it yay good eye line a day but I pay the subtle scrub now just because one set the pivot so it's the way yep the other side is like little longer flick where I'm using some bottom lash mascara on the bottom lashes I'm going to use my bronze ambition eyeliner on my waterline and I'm going to use my Smashbox full exposure mascara I'm gonna put on falsies as well force I wouldn't even get over how huge this wanders it's like insanity I feel like this pigment is real sultry like it gives that real sultry of it because it doesn't look tidy because it's got that joy during crime because a joy foam so it looks really like smudgy and just like so pretty I love it anyways I'm going to be reusing these so I'm gonna pull the glue off these are the felines by EXO bTW I just put a little bit of jar dark blue on there and I'm just going to apply these oops I'm loving using twizz's at moment if you guys come toe makes it so much easier I always was to skip if you can hear that noise it's literally like walking across my makeup it's on the floor don't ask I'm like measuring it so that's what the eye makeup looks like you might still see a little bit blue driving but uh I love this eye shadow I just I can't get over it it's just amazing okay so foot bronzer I'm gonna be using my knobs Laguna and Mike so beauty brought a brush and I will contour with this as well so I put on tons of bronzer as you can see alright and now I'm going to put on a little bit of blush I'm choosing peach by makeup store because it just goes with everything and because I'm going to do a few different lip colors I think this is the best choice because it goes with like any lip color so I'm using my joy fiber precise blush brush and I'm going to put the lets of highlighter on because I just love Julie skin so this is ste like kitten you are okay so for the lips first I'm going to show you look like a peachy pink kind of color which is my favorite to wear with this this is Australis color inject mineral lipstick in honky-tonk so that's what that one there looks like really nice kind of light pinky peachy color goes a little more pink um camera at the moment minute kind of is in real life it's quite close I guess that's quite closely so this is no de black label lipstick by NYX so if you love pale nerds and stuff that's how that looks to make them note a little bit more wearable some kind of thumbs up yeah look look I've got like no lips or something I'm using a crucian glass by Mick you use any kind of lip gloss this one's called Ritchie lush Richard lusha this goes a little bit more time it chin makes a little bit more wearable and I'm gonna try read this is rigged or rate by Elizabeth Arden it's a really bright red I love it I'm just hopeless every lips I'm gonna give up I'm try to make it look perfect but that's how it looks with red lips so if you were more like Deering or something go the red look if you want so what color do you prefer do you like read node or pink let me know down below I hope you guys have it the best day and I will talk to you again really soon I know if you can see it's like not even like drooping anywhere but I should probably shouldn't do that cuz next thing I'll get it everywhere alright so I'm just going to kind of debit all my face don't really know how much to put on so start the emergency here we go",

        "video_title": "How to Build a Fire - Fire Steel & Accelerants",
        "video_sub_title": "hello seriously Robert here and today we're gonna look at fire making techniques the purpose of this video is to demonstrate how to use a fire steel or a Ferro rod to ignite a fire to help us stay warm at night to help us survive in a survival situation or whatever needs you may have for starting a fire when we use the words fire late we're talking about a fire bed or a fire structure what we're going to build our fire home there are three things necessary to get a fire started the first is tender the second is kindling and the third is fuel generally the tinder is very small pieces broken up bark breaking up leaves small twigs small pine needles things such as that that will ignite very rapidly we can also use man-made elements to accelerate the starting of a fire and we're going to look at some of these products today we're gonna look at the products to determine whether they can be ignited with a fire steel or whether we're going to have an open flame to ignite these products and help us build our fire having an open flame such as a lighter or matches as always your best route but using a fire steel is a little more primitive but it is a route that will work very well under most circumstances so having tender which is your broken up very small pieces that ignite easily is the first step and we ignite the tinder with our Ferro rod second we add kindling to the fire to develop a better flame to get it burning a little better and then we transfer this to our fire structure or a fire light now you can ignite this underneath your fire lay and this just basically boils down to personal preference there's different fire ladies that you're gonna hear talked about are the teepee lake they lean too far a cross-stitch fire the log cabin fire or lay and the Dakota firehole and one thing about the Dakota firehole is this is an underground fire basically so this is when you need stealth when you don't want to be detected when you don't want too much smoke when you don't want your flame to be seen from a long distance away the type that we're gonna use for the sake of this video is the log cabin fire so let's get started all right here we're gonna see several different methods that can be used to start fire and all of these methods are pretty easy to carry along with you and some type of bug out bag or some type of survival kit we're gonna look at what they are and you know the type of method you would have to use to get these fires started we can see you know a lot of different products here the first is the insta fire fire starter and this stuff brags a lot about itself here on the package and it burns that nearly a thousand degrees burns and winds up to thirty miles an hour burns on snow and even floats and burns on water so as you can see there the back of it and the front of it so we're going to test that out and see if it holds up to what it's saying it will zip fire starters don't know if you've ever seen these these are made to light the package and see how well they burn you know if you have any of these and you have an open flame with this Duffus it's gonna go very well but we're gonna look at see which one of these items we can use our fire steel on to get these going so that sums up fuel some clean exes you know that's always easy to get a fire going and here's our dryer lint now this I've just got it shoved in this cardboard tube so it'd be easy for me to bring out here today don't normally carry it like this because if my pack were to get a little damp on the inside then it would ruin the lint here but we know this is really flammable got my fire starter kit with a lot of different things and we're gonna look at the cot involved vaseline method got our Vaseline petroleum jelly I should say let me be specific with that with a hundred percent pure petroleum jelly so if you get the kind that's 80 or seventy-five percent pure you may not get the same results as hopefully we will see here now the reason I've got everything on this cardboard box is just to make it easier for us to see in the video first thing you need is tinder and kindling you got to have something that's gonna burn easy being out in the woods there's a lot of different things you can use for this and that's what I carry these believe it or not little pencil sharpeners pencil sharpeners are a good way for me to get Kinlan when i have small sticks like this i can put these in here and I just basically well this sticks not even gonna hold up to it but basically create my small kindling some other things that work good is these dried thorn branches as you see these things dry and they become very very good you know very good to burn very good let's move that to the side so you know you simply moving in and look at this makes really good really good kentley I'm left with it a little bit of a sharp stick when I get done I take this and then I break it all up or you know break it into even smaller pieces and I've got some pretty good kindling going right there so I'm gonna have to keep on with that for a little while longer sometimes you want to wear your gloves sometimes it's better easier to work with them Oh building a fire seems like a simple task on the outside looking in under extreme circumstances this can be extremely difficult out here today the weather is decent but everything is really damp it snowed yesterday and the day before here in South Carolina but today it's 50 degrees so it has warmed back up a lot so here we go I'm having to protect it from the wind a little bit but I'm gonna break up my little pieces to more smaller pieces here we go [Applause] so that's gonna start good but I also want to get some things that work a little better and I'm gonna try some of these dried leaves so now this is actually very easy from here okay you got the old ladder of course we've got it whooped at this point in time you know we've got a fire now not just the same thing where they be you know you're cases of matches waterproof matches that's why this kind of stuff is extremely important to have any type of survival kit is it's gonna be a lot easier for me to start this fire with an already existing flame then it is gonna be for me to start this fire with either a fire starter like this or even a larger fire starter is gonna be a little more difficult I wouldn't normally do this on a piece of cardboard is because I would build this onto a small piece of wood a small fire board if you will and I would take the fire board and place it underneath my fire structure once I get done you know getting the fire lit I'm going to transfer this I probably should have started here to begin with but I'm gonna transfer this to this fire board okay we're gonna start it up there it goes let's get some more oh man now what I'm gonna do is transfer this to fire all right here we go now get over here you got it Johnny mm-hmm all right so here I'm gonna fly some more kindling I'm gonna get these going good but what I'm gonna do now is I'm going to slowly start to increase the size of the fuel that I'm putting on as we can see this fire is going pretty good are starting to and we're in a pretty windy situation so this is where you want to be careful notice how the embers they are traveling everywhere I mean they're blowing up so we got to keep an eye even though it is damp out here you still have the no possibility of a forest fire and that's definitely something that we don't want to happen okay now that we've seen what a fire steel can do and how to use one we're gonna look at the other items that we had and we're gonna see how easy it is to light with a fire steel and with a lighter so we're gonna check out first here okay we got one cotton ball here saturated with with Vaseline first we're gonna try to like this with a Ferro rod and we're gonna see how well that works let's see how easy it is to light that right there lit up very quick so that's an excellent excellent means of starting a fire with just a Ferro rod just one spark we saw that and we're seeing how long it burns for and I'm timing it with my stopwatch here so we may elapse this for the video and it has been right out a minute that is burned and it's still burning so at this point at this rate we know that this will definitely serve as an excellent fire starter toss that over into the fire and let's move on to the next one all right next we're gonna move on to a second one and this one is the dryer lint we're gonna see how well the dryer lint burns with using just now first I want to go back using the cotton ball and the vaseline or the petroleum jelly we use we saw we didn't need an open flame so if it likes where the fire still it's definitely going to combust with an open flame so next we're gonna look at the dryer lint so Johnny try it once again with the fire steel there you go there you go and there it is fire steel fire steel something everybody needs but as we can see with the dryer lint it does not burn anywhere near as long as the petroleum jelly burn but still this has burned plenty long enough for me to get a fire started let's look at the other stuff I want to see if these tissues here if they'll combust with a fire steel now anything that will combust with the fire steel we know for a fact that an open flame is gonna light it so you know matches or lighter it's definitely going to do the trick for anything but let's check it out with the fire steel here let's see what happens small pieces if that helps any there we go and there we go folks fire steel on till own tissues probably works the same with toilet paper maxi pads anything looky there it's going good it's going good excellent excellent all right put those in the fire let's move on to the next one we're gonna use we're gonna try it with the fire steel but I think we're gonna have to use an open flame it's the xilk fire starter now these I have tried before lighting them with a flame and they do pretty well but what we want to do today is Johnny open this up open this up and break off some little chunks onto the cardboard down there and let's see if we can get a fire started now let's start it with the fire steel let's see if we can get this going with a fire steel and we'll see if it's something that's you know I would need an open flame for okay it looks like if it is gonna start with the fire still that it's gonna take quite a while so we're just gonna tackle this one we're gonna tackle this one with this set of matches there let's see how well the matches do you want these are some really cheap matches so keep that in mind yeah with an open flame this goes up immediately talk about fat wood and it's for a good reason this is some very good stuff so like I said technical data about it or some links in the description and all that wood and when we pull it out and smell it you know you can almost smells like it's gonna burn so let's see how this starts alright first we're gonna try to start this with a fire starter and I got a feeling that it's not gonna work to you well but maybe I'm wrong here okay all right we'll stop there it possibly you know I'm not gonna say it's not gonna happen probably if I took this flat wood and I broke it in half our cut it in half and I filed some of it now maybe using the pencil sharpener that we saw earlier or you know using the serrated blade on my fixed blade knife a serrated edge then you know we probably could create some dust you know some Kinlan or some for this but uh looks like it's gonna need an open flame for the big sticks like this so let's see how quickly it goes up with the open flame and it looks like we're going now it looks like the flame is going okay this is looks to me like it's gonna burn fairly slow and in good conditions it would be easy to light like we saw out here as long as this stuff is dry as long as this kept drying maybe in a some type of water type container in your bag or something then you know it's gonna work because we can see here it's burn is slow one last thing and that is the military-grade insta fire military-grade insta fire alright so now this stuff they're supposed to be enough in here to start for fires and no harmful chemicals are supposed to be friendly to the ecosystem around us light it with a match or a lighter and it should light almost instantaneously we're gonna try it with the firestarter with the fire steel to begin with alright that's good alright now let's see how quickly we can get this thing going the open flame and let's see what it'll do it looks almost like it's melting instead of turning to ash you know like we expect from a class alpha fire you know that class alpha is anything that leaves an ash class Bravo is a fuel class Charlie is an electrical fire in class Delta is other and that would refer to your burning metals and such as that possibly it's going to ash up yes some of us asking up now and as we can see that's several different methods for you know building starting a fire we talked about a lot of different things but we see a lot of products that we saw some of them work with the fire steel some have to have an open flame so depending on what's to your advantage we don't always have an open flame so I like the ones that do that do ignite quickly with a fire steel so if I'm going to take the time in trouble to pack my bag with items that I'm gonna use to help start a fire then it's probably going to be ones that will ignite with the fire steel that we saw and there's a lot of different options and there's a lot more that I didn't even mention in the video so if there are other methods that people would like to add to it please add in the comments below because always looking for more knowledge more ways to do things more efficient ways better ways so I hope the video is informative and for now serious survivor out [Music]",

        "video_sub_title": "hi everyone welcome back so today i am doing a crazy for coral and this is an eye look showing you how to incorporate coral into your everyday look like i said this is part of the color series that I'm doing with Cassie shades of Cassie I will link her video out for this look I am using a blush that's right a blush so I just show you how you don't have to go out and buy any coral i shadow you can just go ahead and use something that you have that way you don't have to make an extra investment in a color that you might not wear as often so the next part of this series will be four coral bead lips and cheeks so bila on the lookout for that if you'd like to see some of our favorite lips and cheeks combos for quarrel and then also you know we might try and do another coral look today I just showed you how to use coral as an eyeshadow and incorporate it into your eye look to make it very wearable so if you are interested in seeing this look then go ahead and keep watching i did in my other tutorial with the jumbo eye pencil from NYX in milk this is just a matte white base and I said in the other video the reason that I do this is when you're working with light colors it really helps to bring them out and make them appear more pigmented and since we're working with a coral color I really want to have a nice light base down so any light white ish face that you have works i really like this one because it's matt i will link below the lavender eye tutorial that i did it's very similar to this but now we're switching it up and using a pop of coral okay i'm going into the Urban Decay Naked basics palette I love this thing I i used it almost every day i'm going to go into the color walk of shame any match cream color you have a work i'm going to put this all over the lid you can you can use a foxy as well i'm just using walk of shame because it's a a little bit more peachy and I figured since we're working with corals it will work nice so just go ahead and place that all over the lid I'm just using an elf brush for this I've just kind of lays down a little bit coral color I'm going into the Baum's hot mama blush this is known as a shadow or a blush it's like a peachy color almost looks a little bit like NARS orgasm now you can use this or I know Mac has expensive pink which is something very similar but I'm just going to take this up and up brush from target and just go in there and tap it off and we're just going to run this through our crease if you don't have a coral I shadow and you just don't feel like you would invest you would like to invest in one try pulling out one of your coral blushes and use it as an eyeshadow that way you can get the same look what you don't have to make an investment in a coral color that you might not wear as frequently as you would other colors so there we went we kind of place that all over so it's going as you can see on this side it peeks out the top so it's just going to be picking out the top we're just going to go back into this or basics palette and I'm using any shimmery white color you have go ahead and put that right under and blend it out and I'm going to put this in the inner corner as well and then on the lower OOP the lower inner portion of my lid and just the bottom part of it kind of any where will we put that walk of shame color if you have the Urban Decay Naked 2 palette you could use booty call and foxy for the first part of this look if you have the Urban Decay Naked one pallet you could use cave and use naked and virgin so any shimmery colors you know you doesn't have to be the same colors it's just really the egg I'm going to take an angle brush and I'm going to go in faint and put that any Matt Brown I'm just going to run along the lower lash line and we are going to darken that up with another color now I'm going to take max embark it's like a reddish tone brown and I'm also just going to deepen up the outer portion of my crease with this now I'm going to take this little crease brush from ELF and I'm going to go into embark and we're just going to kind of run that along the very outer portion of our crease ever so gently go down kind of make this outer triangle just try and stay below the coral color so that that peeks out above it and then now I'm just going to get out just a little bit right in the inner portion of this lid the crease brush or take the puffy brush that has no color on it and just go in that we used in the coral and just go in and blend out that line I'm going to go in with a brown liner i'm using a gel liner this is from the Loreal infallible and this one is in bronze so this is L'Oreal's lacquer liner and bronze and i'm just going to do a small winged liner right here just barely at all but making it thicker towards the outside and getting thinner when it goes in and then i take whatever is left and i kind of run it along my waterline now i'm going to go in with benefits they're real mascara and just do several coats of this however many coats you like so on the rest of my face i used macs warm soul which is just a really nice bronze you brush i just use this brush and i kind of went on the backs of my cheeks with it I lip combination i used the cream chain lipstick from Mac this is sunny soul it's just a really nice pinky peach color I thought it would pair well with the corals and then I topped it with this gloss in sandy buxom gloss and sandy I just kind of got in the middle this is the finished look and I hope you all liked it or any other questions or comments and go ahead and

        "video_title": "How To Cure Tinnitus In 1 Minute",
        "video_sub_title": "Tinnitus is usually described as a ringing in the ears, but it can also sound like clicking, hissing, roaring, or buzzing. Tinnitus involves perceiving sound when no external noise is present. The sound can be very soft or very loud, and high-pitched or low-pitched. Some people hear it in one ear and others hear it in both. People with severe tinnitus may have problems hearing, working, or sleeping. Tinnitus is not a disease \u2014 it\u2019s a symptom. It\u2019s a sign that something is wrong with your auditory system, which includes your ear, the auditory nerve that connects the inner ear to the brain, and the parts of the brain that process sound. There are a variety of different conditions that can cause tinnitus. One of the most common is noise-induced hearing loss. In this video we share our top tips to cure tinnitus. Any extra resources or information will be included in the description so make sure to check it out. Our first tip is to try to Hearing aids. Most people develop tinnitus as a symptom of hearing loss. When you lose hearing, your brain undergoes changes in the way it processes sound frequencies. A hearing aid is a small electronic device that uses a microphone, amplifier, and speaker to increase the volume of external noises. This can mollify neuroplastic changes in the brain\u2019s ability to process sound. If you have tinnitus, you may find that the better you hear, the less you notice your tinnitus. A 2007 survey of healthcare providers published in The Hearing Review, found that roughly 60 percent of people with tinnitus experienced at least some relief from a hearing aid. Roughly 22 percent found significant relief. Our second tip is to try Sound-masking devices. Sound-masking devices provide a pleasant or benign external noise that partially drowns out the internal sound of tinnitus. The traditional sound-masking device is a tabletop sound machine, but there are also small electronic devices that fit in the ear. These devices can play white noise, pink noise, nature noises, music, or other ambient sounds. Most people prefer a level of external sound that is just slightly louder than their tinnitus, but others prefer a masking sound that completely drowns out the ringing. Some people use commercial sound machines designed to help people relax or fall asleep. You can also use headphones, television, music, or even a fan. A 2017 study in the journal Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience found that masking was most effective when using broadband noise, such as white noise or pink noise. Nature sounds proved much less effective. Our third tip is to try Modified or customized sound machines. Standard masking devices help to mask the sound of tinnitus while you are using them, but they have no long-lasting effects. Modern medical-grade devices use customized sounds tailored specifically to your tinnitus. Unlike regular sound machines, these devices are only worn intermittently. You may experience benefits long after the device is turned off, and over time, you may experience long-term improvement in the perceived loudness of your tinnitus. A 2017 study published in the Annals of Ontology, Rhinology, and Laryngology, found that customized sound decreases the loudness of tinnitus and may be superior to broadband noise. Our fourth tip is to try Behavioral therapy. Tinnitus is associated with a high level of emotional stress. Depression, anxiety, and insomnia are not uncommon in people with tinnitus. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of talk therapy that helps people with tinnitus learn to live with their condition. Rather than reducing the sound itself, CBT teaches you how to accept it. The goal is to improve your quality of life and prevent tinnitus from driving you crazy. CBT involves working with a therapist or counselor, typically once per week, to identify and change negative thought patterns. CBT was initially developed as a treatment for depression and other psychological problems, but it seems to work well for people with tinnitus. Several studies and meta-reviews, including one published in the Korean Journal of Audiology, have found that CBT significantly improves irritation and annoyance that often comes with tinnitus. Our fifth tip is to try Progressive tinnitus management. Progressive tinnitus management (PTM) is a therapeutic treatment program offered by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Tinnitus is one of the most common disabilities seen in veterans of the armed services. The loud noises of war (and training) often lead to noise-induced hearing loss. If you\u2019re a veteran, talk to your local VA hospital about their tinnitus treatment programs. You may want to consult the National Center for Rehabilitative Auditory Research (NCRAR) at the VA. They have a step-by-step tinnitus workbook and educational materials that may be helpful. Our sixth tip is to try Exercise. Exercise contributes significantly to your overall well-being. Tinnitus can be aggravated by stress, depression, anxiety, lack of sleep, and illness. Regular exercise will help you manage stress, sleep better, and stay healthier. Our final tip is to try Mindfulness-based stress reduction. During an eight-week course of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), participants develop the skills to control their attention through mindfulness training. Traditionally, the program was designed to draw people\u2019s attention away from their chronic pain, but it can be equally effective for tinnitus. The similarities between chronic pain and tinnitus have led researchers to develop a mindfulness-based tinnitus stress reduction (MBTSR) program. The results of a pilot study, which were published in The Hearing Journal, found that participants of an eight-week MBTSR program experienced significantly altered perceptions of their tinnitus. This included a reduction in depression and anxiety. So that sums up our top tips for curing tinnitus.

in my other eye in medical writings this other eye is usually referred to as the fellow I a number of medical studies involving retinal vein occlusion patients discuss the fellow eye you're just a couple of examples in addition to specifying how many patients participated reports on these studies will often disclose the number of patients who at the beginning of the study have had a history of retinal vein occlusion in the fellow eye or have retinal vein occlusions currently going on in both eyes when you look at this column remember that the large medical centers involved in these studies probably have a higher mix of difficult cases as smaller clinics referred tougher cases to these larger centers occasionally a report will mention the occurrence of a retinal vein occlusion in the fellow I occurring during this study reports like these confirm that this type of trouble in both eyes does occur but because of the small number of retinal vein occlusions occurring during the follow-up period estimating the likelihood of developing a retinal vein occlusion in the fellow eye with some level of confidence is difficult at least two larger studies have attempted to quantify this likelihood in 1994 dr. hey ray and fellow researchers reported on a large consecutive series of patients with various types of retinal vein occlusions who were seen at the University of Iowa more than 1,100 patients with all types of retinal vein occlusions were entered into this study including Central hema central and branch retinal vein occlusions a little more than half of the study participants were central retinal vein occlusion patients and the median time that these patients were involved in this study was more than two years the study investigators determined that if an individual had any type of retinal vein occlusion in one eye the estimated chance of developing any type of retinal vein occlusion in the fellow I was a little under eight percent at two years from the date of the original occlusion the rate of occurrence of subsequent retinal vein occlusions in the fellow eye appeared to be greatest in the first six months after the original occlusion after that time point the rate of occurrence was reduced but continued at a steady rate for several more years afterward this team also presented information on the estimated likelihood of developing the exact same type of retinal vein occlusion in the fellow eye for example if nonischemic central retinal vein occlusion was present in the study I there was about a six and a half percent chance of developing the exact same type of occlusion nonischemic central retinal vein occlusion in the fellow eye during the first two years after the initial occlusion but information on the likelihood that the same nonischemic central retinal vein occlusion I would have of developing any other type of retinal vein occlusion was not presented another study called the central vein occlusion study considered only central retinal vein occlusion patients this study was concluded in the early 1990s and involved more than 700 patients the majority of whom were followed for more than two years the study investigators estimated that the chance of developing any type of retinal vascular occlusion in the fellow I was about one percent per year in other words the chance of developing a central or branch or hema central retinal vein occlusion or any other type of vascular occlusion including arterial occlusion zin the fellow I would be about 1% during the first year or two percent during the first two years or three percent in the first three years and so on the vascular occlusions that occurred in the fellow eye during the study follow-up of our half or central retinal vein occlusions it's entirely possible that the studies discussed in this video may overestimate the likelihood of developing retinal vein occlusions in the fellow I smaller practices in clinics often refer more difficult cases to larger well-regarded institutions and practices where these types of I studies are usually carried out of all the people who get retinal vein occlusions many of the more difficult cases are referred to the larger institutions leaving these larger institutions with the disproportionate number of older or sicker or more severe cases which perhaps leads to a higher rate of occlusion in the fellow eye in studies like these population-based studies like the Beaver Dam I study and the Blue Mountains I study were large segments of a general population or followed over long period of time appear to show lower rates of retinal vein occlusions in the fellow eye but the number of participants developing retinal vein occlusions during these studies is small and the participants developing a retinal vein occlusion in the fellow eye is even smaller making these rates more prone to anomalies of chance nonetheless these population-based studies hold out at least the possibility that rates of retinal vein occlusion in the fellow I might be a good bit smaller in the general population then the rates discussed earlier derived from large institutions and medical practices to sum up and although retinal vein occlusion sometimes affect both eyes the large majority of patients will not have to deal with this type of problem knowing that this kind of problem occasionally happens gives us as patients the opportunity to work with our doctors to take steps to eliminate any risk factors we may have for retinal vein occlusion and to start doing more of the common sense things to take better care of ourselves",

        "video_sub_title": "hello and welcome to another episode of interactive biology TV where we're making biology fun my name is Leslie Samuel and before I get into this episode I just want to send a shout out to Richard Morris and his friend Nathan Richard sent me an e-mail a few days ago letting me know that they appreciate the videos and that they have watched every single video that I have published here the interactive biology TV and that is just awesome Richard and Nathan I hope you have gotten a tremendous amount of value and I hope that you continue to get a tremendous amount of value from the videos that you are watching here at interactive biology TV now I know there are so many of you out there that have been watching the videos and I want to let you know how much I appreciate every minute that you spend watching these videos thank you for every comment that has been left thank you for every question that has been asked and all of the feedback that I've been getting it is just tremendous to know that this is helping so many people all over the world so thank you thank you thank you inside this episode episode 49 I'm going to be talking about what a stroke volume and how to calculate it so let's just get right into it when I'm talking about stroke volume I'm talking about the amount of blood that is pumped by one ventricle during each heart beat so we know that the heart beats and we know that blood comes into the heart and when the ventricle contracts it pushes that blood out to the rest of the body and to the lungs we've looked at this in detail in episode 44 so if you need to review that you can go back to episode 44 to check out those details so here we're looking at the heart and for right now we're just going to look at the left ventricle and what is happening is blood is coming into the left atrium and then into the left ventricle and when it reaches in the left ventricle after a short period of time the ventricles contract and that pushes blood as you can see here it pushes the blood out into the aorta and that then goes to the rest of the body that's a brief overview but once again you can go back to episode 44 to check out more details about that now there are a few definitions that I want you to know definition number one systole systole is the contraction of the heart then we have diastole and that's the relaxation of the heart so systole is contraction diastole is relaxation then we have the end diastolic volume or the II D V which is the amount of blood in the ventricle right before ventricular contraction so right before the ventricle contracts the amount of blood that we have in the ventricle we call that the end diastolic volume which makes sense it's right at the end of diastole so that's the end diastolic volume then of course we have the end systolic volume which is the amount of blood left in the ventricle right after ventricular contraction so when the ventricles contract and it pushes the blood out to the lungs and out to the rest of the body the amount of blood that we have left over that is the end systolic volume which once again makes sense because it's at the end of systole with those definitions let's look at a graph alright so what we have here is a graph on the x-axis we have time and the y-axis we have volume in milliliters so we're looking at the amount of blood in the ventricle and for this example we're going to talk about the left ventricle which is the one that pushes the blood into the aorta to go to the rest of the body so let's say ventricular contraction has just finished when that contraction is finished the ventricle starts to get filled with blood again so after that contraction another cycle starts where blood flows into the ventricles so here we have blood getting into the ventricle at a certain point we're going to have a more rapid filling and when it reaches this point and we're not going to talk about too many details where this part is concerned we're going to talk more about that in a later episode but let's say this is the point where the ventricle contracts what's going to happen here is when the ventricle contracts that's going to push the blood out of the ventricle and it's going to go to the rest of the body so here we have a certain amount of blood and here we have a certain amount of blood the amount of blood that we have in here right before the contraction we're going to call that the e D V once the contraction is over we're going to call that the e s V na the way we calculate the stroke volume is SV stroke volume is equal to e D V minus e s V so if the end diastolic volume is 120 milliliters of blood and the end systolic volume is around let's say it's 50 milliliters the stroke volume is going to be 120 milliliters minus 50 milliliters and that is going to be equal to 70 milliliters and I just realized here that I wrote five I meant to put 50 so I'm just going to put that zero here so 120 minus 50 is equal to 70 70 would be my stroke volume so once again the ventricle fills with blood at a certain point the ventricle contracts that pushes the blood out of ventricle and to the rest of the body at the end of the contraction we have an end systolic volume if that end systolic volume is 50 milliliters and the end diastolic volume is a hundred and twenty milliliters the stroke volume will be 120 minus 50 and that's going to be equal to 70 that's pretty much it for this episode of course if you want to see more you can go to interactive dash biology comm where we have more biology videos and many other resources we're adding to the resources on a regular basis to try to help make biology fun that's it for this video and I'll see you in the next one",

        "video_sub_title": "hi everyone and welcome back to my channel today I'm doing a hair tutorial and I'm going to show you how to get these soft bouncy Hollywood ish curls using heated rollers this is a technique that I've been using on my hair recently because I really love the way it looks I can't achieve this exact look with any of my other hair tools and I posted a picture of my hair on snapchat yesterday and asked if you guys wanted to see a tutorial and literally hundreds of you said yes so that's what I'm going to do today please give the video a thumbs up for more hair tutorials and please please subscribe to my channel if you're new and if you already subscribed please do turn on notifications for my channel by clicking on the little bow next to my name down below so you never miss a video so keep watching to find out how I got this past so first of all I just want to run through review the prep for the hair because it is quite important usually when I wash my hair I use really deep conditioning products to make my hair really soft and silky and but that's not really the best thing to do when you're using heated rollers if the hair is too like silky and slippery then it doesn't take to de call very well and it's not going to stay and this also definitely does not work best on freshly washed hair I think if you're planning to do this wash your hair the day before and just let it sit I washed my hair yesterday so my hair is like one day wash and the shampoo and conditioner I use this time with the red can beach envy volume texturising shampoo and then to styler I used some heat protectant spray you can use any this is a THD one it is really important just to use a heat protectant on your spray because when you're blow-drying and putting heated rollers in is a lot of pressure on your hair and it can be really damaging so it's definitely important to protect it and I also used some of this at John Frieda shear blonde styling foam and a mousse has helped again to texturize your hair and helps hold a silence so they're all the products that are used on my hair and then I just gave it a rough blow-dry to keep it relatively nice and shiny so these are the rollers that I'm going to be using and these are the ballast boutique rollers and these are really nice because the barrel is velvety so it's a lot softer on your hair and it protects a lot more so you have 12 rollers in here that heat up and they're like a medium to large size they're 32 millimeters and I know that you can get rollers there are a lot bigger than this these are like a medium to large standard size and that all the same size as well which I really like because in a lot of heated roller sets and you had like four large for medium and four small and I just don't really like I think it looks so much better if the curls all the same size personally and then also the clips that you clip in the roller are heated as well which is really good it just puts extra heat on the hair and is going to make the curl more defined and hopefully stay longer as well so this is the book they come in and now you can see why they probably caught my eye and you can get them from boots I actually ordered mine from ASOS I'll leave a link down below in the description box so yeah I'm going to show you how to use these to create some nice soft bouncy hollywood-esque but still like natural curls so it starts off with you just want to brush through your hair because if it's not it's going to make this a lot more difficult so then you're just going to want to separate your hair into sections and again this totally depends on how much hair you have but personally I like to divide it up into three sections one middle section like going back and then the two sides I'll start off by just kind of making sure my hair is going in the same direction and then I take a little time but to be honest you could just use your fingers and you just want to like start to separate the hair going all the way back down to the bat so now I have a line where the hair is going back and I'm just going to clip that section into place and do the same on the other side so going from the front and just suppressing it form so I've lifted you up so you can see what I'm doing so I've got my middle section here and this is the section I'm going to start with and I'm going to start from the front and go backwards and I have 12 rollers so I can use for rollers perfection so I'm going to start with this front section making sure it's nicely brushed through so there are no knots and I'm going to spray the hair before I put the roller in and the hairspray that I'm using is the Loreal Elnett hairspray because I love these hairspray and it is the very volume version I'm going to fray this all over the hair from root to tip then taking my first roller I'm going to put the roller behind for her and just wrap it around and if you have layers it's quite hard because the end will pop out and you have to make sure that you tuck them otherwise you're going to get like a straight bit at the end of your curl you definitely don't want that so flushing down those bits of hair that are trying to escape and roll the roller up to go ahead keeping it really really tight that's so important even if it hurts your hair a little bit and feels like it's being pulled out the tighter you can pull this in the better and I'm just going to secure it at the back we'd want to be heated clip there just had one done and I'll pull out your next section and this is definitely an arm workout give it a spray and just wrap the hair around keeping it as tight and taut as possible so I should have something like this it is quite tricky I'm not going to lie it took me quite a few practices to get it right and even now like I'm still quite slow [Music] [Music] also another tip is to try and get the hair as flat as possible on the roller try and make sure that it's not twisted so now I'm going to move on to the side sections of my hair and literally just repeat all of those steps so I'm going to start with the top section which is like the most important section follow the fray and pull the hair really tight over the barrel someone better just tuck in the stray hairs as you go along pull it nice and tight and clip it into place [Music] [Music] [Music] so I have all 12 rollers in and I've just given my hair another spray of hairspray and you need to leave these in as long as possible I think the instruction manual says about 15 minutes but I personally try and leave them in for an hour so go and have your breakfast if you're doing in the morning do your makeup do other things and try and leave them in as long as possible don't take them out unless you can feel that they have completely cooled down so I'm going to go and have my lunch and what's a bit of Gilmore Girls and come back and take them out for you okay so it's been about an hour so it's time to take the rollers out so when you take them out you need to be sure like to take them out really gently and so you don't pull the curl out so just like unwrap them like this and kind of just let the hair today and then this is the last layer of hairspray our hair will get but just lightly spray the curl once you take it out [Music] [Music] okay so obviously the hair looks a bit crazy right now but obviously the reason we put so much hairspray in in the first place is because we are going to also you brush the curls out so the best kind of brush to use to brush Carl out and brush most of the hairspray out is a soft bristle brush this is the finishing brush by Denman and you can really use any brush but if you're going to use a brush like this on my wet brush which is my favorite brush the little bristles are quite long so they go quite deep into the hair and more likely to pull the curl out whereas a soft like short bristle brush like this kind of just pains the tops it will take out any excess hairspray and also just make the curls look a bit more natural make the hair look nice and shiny and so this kind of brush is perfect for what we're doing so you want to start from the bottom you don't want to go like from the top and drag it down because that's just going to pull it all out so start for the bottom and just really gently brush through the curls if you have any kinks like I've just noticed to have a slight kink in my hair here maybe just from where I didn't put it across the roller as flat flesh is done then just like take them out with your straightening iron and then you're pretty much done I mean I wasn't planning on passing my hair like this but it just seems to soar like this and I really like it when things I'm just going to leave it and it kind of adds to that old Hollywood glamour style anyway if your finishing touches you might just want to like tidy up the tops of your hair and even add in some volume so you could take your brush or if you have a kind of comb like this or you on my other comb like this and just spray a little bit of hairspray onto the comb and because we don't really want to spray our head again because we've literally put so much hairspray on by now and then you can just like tame the top of it just so it looks altra smooth and glamorous could also whether her has had heat on it and it's very prone to like flyways and frizzy bits so you can just comb these out with a little bit of hairspray on your brush and then I like to do is just add in a little bit of hair serum or oil just because again the heat has probably made it quite dry so it's nice to put bit of moisture and hydration back into the hair so I like to use the evader dry remedy oil this is one of my favourite hair products and love it so much it just really feels like it nourishes your hair but it doesn't make it boil your greasy at all so I just put a couple of drops of that includes hung my hand rub it together and then just kind of put it into the end so then we're done I really hope you guys enjoyed the tutorial don't forget to give it a thumbs up if you did and subscribe to my channel if you're new and let me know in the comment sections if there's any other hair tutorials hair styles or techniques if you'd like me to try out on my channel hope you all have an amazing week and as always I shall see you next Monday in my video bye

sugar content on most of the protein bars out there holy smokes these are my balls ha ha ha ha my daughter has her headphones on so she's not yelling at me okay ready to make some protein bites let me show you what I have for you today I've got my protein powder that's going in here and today I am going to use our vanilla chai flavor why because I'm making pumpkin protein bites baby is going to be our source of the glue for this and why pumpkin it's super rich in beta-carotene lots of antioxidants and this is not just about Halloween or pumpkin pie you can get pureed pumpkin like this year-round take a screenshot of that organic pumpkin in the East septic package you just want to shake it up before you use it and cut it off and we use pumpkin and a lot of things these bites are a great way to use it and look we're getting our veggies in there so who knew we're making protein bites that are full of veggies bingo like awesome like double awesome okay now the other thing that I have our quick cook oats you want to use the quick cook kind please do me a favor and do not use steel-cut for these is I like to make a double batch of these so I'll make a batch that I'm gonna roll today and then I'll put the rest in the freezer see what I'm saying make it once but double the bash double the pleasure double the fun you know so I'm gonna do I've got the little scoop today cuz here's the dealio this is real this is the real dish and I'm a real mom and I'm a real business owner and I really didn't do the dishes today hey so my measuring cups are in the dishwasher somewhere so I'm using the little scoop but I'm gonna eyeball it cuz I've been doing this for a long time and I'm gonna put in about two cups of my quick cook oats all right and then the other cast of characters that I have here besides my pumpkin and my protein powder pumpkin pie spice and some cinnamon cuz why not why not a little pumpkin pie spice in our life on a Friday and then some dark chocolate and I'm gonna keep it in the bag because I'm gonna mash it up I'm gonna take my aggression out a little bit you know every girl and guy has to have a mallet that would be this and this is going to crush our chocolate and I've just put some water on boil now this is my secret this is like what I'm counting I swear I'm gonna patent this recipe if I can but the way to make this work so well it just a little bit just a little bit not too much a boiling hot water with these otherwise the rest is raw so you have the benefit of the raw enzymes and I like to you know encourage eating raw drinking raw something every single day a lot of stuff out there it's just about consumption you know it's not about eating to thrive eating to be your optimum person it's just about satisfying a need to feed at that specific moment and we are these beautiful creatures that are the only people on the only beings on the planet that have the ability to cook and and to use our opposable thumbs to create alchemy in the kitchen okay for this amount I have half a scoop and this is actually my protein powder scoop half a scoop of our raw vanilla chai garden of life protein powder what I have going here in my bowl is the protein powder with the oats and a little bit of water and you see how it's starting to become this crumbly meal this is about the right consistency for the next step okay which is the pumpkin pumpkin can I hear it here from the pumpkin lovers out there who's a pumpkin lover huh tell me I want to hear I want to hear so you're gonna take your pumpkin and you're gonna basically work it around the bowl and you're gonna get it all kind of nice and creamy and saturated and I put in about a quarter cup of my pumpkin here and the thing is these pumpkin bites you guys these balls are raw with the exception of just a little bit of boiling hot water to get our oats to kind of become this almost like this taste for our base and I've been making these for like oh gosh I don't know maybe five years and every time my daughter always asked me for the pumpkin ones that's her favorite so I do pumpkin with the dark chocolate chips which we're gonna add in here in just a moment and it is like it's like candy you need a bite it's just right okay okay so I'm gonna put in about a quarter cup of my granulated stevia you can also use xylitol or erythritol which are zero sugar natural sweeteners and this will not spike your blood sugar you guys this is very important for me so that's can you see the consistency of this you guys I'm gonna add about a quarter teaspoon of the pumpkin pie spice okay now is the time to mash and smash ready this is where we did we've got chocolate chips and they're going in they're going in just like so okay and I've got about a quarter cup now this is dark chocolate so it's good for you that's what I say that's my story and I'm sticking to it I am using a dark chocolate chip that has no sugar added to it so we're keeping that sugar that glycemic index low okay this is chocolate coconut flake I'm gonna roll my balls in here it's fun it's fun to say balls you can say balls there we go there is our coconut roll you're ballsy and then there is your ball just like that so you can roll the balls up and then if you like my coconut idea you take the balls and you put them in the coconut can you roll your balls around okay so you're gonna take your coconut and you're gonna roll your balls just like that so this is what they look like when they're covered in coconut this is what it looks like without the coconut so this is completely not free so that's what it looks like when they're all rolled up and here's what it looks like when you dip them and you can even put them on a little stick for your kids and they're cute I love you mwah and I'm gonna go eat my balls see ya you",

        "video_sub_title": "hi you guys today I'm going to show you this DIY on how to make rose water and a rose exfoliating scrub first starting off with the rose water you're just gonna want to take some fresh cut roses these are mine from Valentine's Day you're gonna want an empty bottle I like to use my fix plus bottle just because I know that it has a fine mr. one cup of water that is purified some essential oils I like vanilla and rose perfume essential oil and I like to add in some rose hip oil in a small saucepan you're just going to add in your purified water and then next you're gonna take all of the petals off of one to two roses and add them inside of the water and as you will see later the color of your roses will change the color of your water so it just depends once you've got all the petals inside then you just want to press them down and make sure that they're all kind of wet and then I like to add in a little mint this is something that just grows in my garden so I wanted to add that in as well next you're just gonna place your rose petals on the stove and you're gonna want to boil them for about 10 minutes this is about five minutes through and then this is after about ten minutes you can really see that all of the color from the roses are gone and the water is just a light pink color you're just gonna take this out and put it back in your measuring cup and let it cool for about fifteen to twenty minutes until it's completely cooled off and then you're just gonna want to pour it into your bottle the benefits of rose water is that it moisturizes your skin and it's an anti-inflammatory next for the row scrub I'm gonna take one cup of Epsom salt or sugar one cup of coconut oil one fresh rose with its petals taken off that I'll show you a little bit later and then we are going to put them all into this blender or food processor if you have one of those I don't so I'm just gonna use my blender and you're just gonna pour all the ingredients inside I also wanted to add a few ingredients like this vitamin E oil which really moisturizes the skin it also contains a ton of antioxidants and is an anti-inflammatory then I'm also going to add the rosehip seed oil this contains a ton of fatty acids that help correct dark spots and really hydrates skin and then I'm adding a little bit of my essential oil vanilla just to make it smell even better than it already does once you've ran it through the blender it should look something like this it smells heavenly and so I just like to put mine in a small jar and keep it inside of my shower and I like to use this about once a week just to exfoliate any dry spots on my legs or hydrate my skin all right you guys I hope you enjoyed this roses DIY scrub and facial spray and I'll see you again next time bye",

        "video_title": "HOW TO FIX HOLES IN YOUR BMX TIRES",
        "video_sub_title": "what's happening guys today I'm in a downtown LA on some store and it's another tech Thursday and for today's installment this guy Tony cat and I we showing you guys how to repair flats how to fix tires I have sidewall blowouts or how to solve is a tire that you thought was completely done but there's a couple little things you can do that'll either get you out of a bind or at least give your tire a little more life time so so let me show you guys some of these ghetto techniques with this tire and wheel that we have right here alright so seeing is we have a shop out here we have a lot of spare tires and wheels that you know kids leave behind I think this hub is actually blown out but even though it's blown out it'll help this tutorial as you can see we got a shadow tire here that it's not too bad usually you can gauge a tire by either the sidewalls and the center pattern alright so upon a further inspection the tire isn't really that bad I would say how's like another well if you're riding every single day this tire can last you another like two to three weeks but as we look closer boom we got a skid mark that left a pretty big hole right there so as you can see the inner tube is actually showing through and that's going to be the reason you get it flats now while this tire you really can't truly salvage what you could do is a couple little fixes that will get you out of a bind you know while you're out street riding and you're stuck somewhere so let me show you a couple tricks you can do to get yourself home alright so first and foremost if you catch this before you actually get it flat the first thing you want to do is remove the air so you know you want to use something sharp to get in there you want to push down on the stuff and get all the air out for a lot of you I would hope you already know how to you know fix a flat but for those of you guys that don't know how to fix a flat I'll go through all the steps now one thing to keep in mind is the more air you let out of the tube the easier will be to remove tire all right so what I usually like to do is I go on the opposite side of where the valve stem is just so it's not in the way and then what you want to do is kind of like squeeze the tire to where you can feel that the tube has very little air left in it and then you can either use a tire lever which I'll show you this way so using a tire lever all you have to do is kind of like use the little flat part of the tire lever get it underneath the beat and the bead would be this part that is a little taller than the rest of the tire and that's what actually gets caught underneath the rim and doesn't allow the tire to rip off that's called a bead so you want to get this tire lever on one side of the bead you don't want to get both beads you want to just get the one side then once it's lifted like this and you have a little lip forming then all you have to do is kind of just slide the tire lever down and if it's really tight what you can do is once you have a lip formed keep your thumb there then go a little further down the tire and lift another part and get it up and over the rim and as you can see now that area has increased you can go down a little further get that underneath the bead again and then once you have I'm going to say like an eighth of the tire off then you can just once again put the lever underneath and just kind of slide it all the way through the tire until it's all completely out one thing you want to be careful with is if you're not using a very smooth tire lever like this if you use like a flathead screwdriver or anything else you're gonna actually pinch the tube and ruin it so be very careful use something that's like dull you want to use a tire lever preferably a plastic one so this doesn't happen or you're going to use a metal one use one that's pretty dull like this I can get underneath the beat pretty easily and just get off now let me get it back on real quick and show you guys how to do it without the tire lever and again this is like you're stuck somewhere riding street and you don't have all these tool to your disposal so I'm going to show you guys real quickly how to do it just using your hands and a little elbow grease so again it's going to be the similar technique to using a tire lever you don't want to find a spot that's actually the opposite of the valve stem so I would go about down here pick that spot and then you're going to actually grab both sides and then what you're going to try and do is using your hands and specially your thumbs and your index finger you can actually try and lift this up and over the rim so again you're going to grab the tire and the bead and you're going to try and get it over the rim so I've been doing this for a long time so I can do it I got some Bank strength to me but for a lot of you guys might be a little bit more difficult again this position that I'm holding the camera in isn't the most conducive to this so let me switch on the other side and you're going to just try and lift it up and over the rim and what you can do too is just push the tire sideways so it kind of like starts wanting to naturally pull off and then once you kind of get like the bead up and over it's just like the other technique if this is a brand new tire it's going to be a lot more difficult also if you have a higher sidewall rim that's going to make it more difficult as well just keep pushing it over until you feel one of the sides is actually going to come up and over the rim and if you look closely without any tire lever just using elbow grease in my hands I've been able to get one side of the tire bead up and over the rim now it's time to keep pushing to get the other one and then same thing like now that you have it off a little bit you want to move further down the tire and then once you do that then you can actually get your fingers under there and just undo the whole thing be careful when doing this because if there's a thorn in your tire or if you've actually ripped the tire and the bead is coming out it will stab your finger that doesn't feel very pleasant so you want to lift it while sliding your hand underneath there but be very slow and gentle about it you don't want to get custody alright so got that off and then once you get one set of tire and the rest is again using some elbow grease you just kind of like use your hand grab the tire I lift it up and over the rim the people just slide off as you can see and voila we got the tire off it's just remove the actual tube that is done pretty easily by just pulling it out of the tire okay so we got that up and now you want to inspect the damage so I'm going to look around here and again the damage here is pretty severe I can really push my finger through it so that tyre is pretty much toast but if you're trying to get home this is something that might save you so look around the street anywhere trash cans whatever and find a little piece of cardboard anything like this you can either use cardboard you can use like a really thin piece of like metal sometimes you can find I honestly I've even seen people use snicker wrappers so you can just fold it up a bunch of time until you get it to where it's like got some thickness to it and all you have to do is just cut it or fold it into a piece it's going to fit right underneath here so let me show you by using this cardboard alright so I'm going to cut a little piece here this piece is about I'm going to say two and a half inches by one and a half inches and I did that by using my thumb to measure this area this piece of your thumb is usually about an inch so yeah two and a half by one and half inches and then all you really do is turn the tire over where the damages look on the inside and you'll be able to see the actual hole place the piece of cardboard on the inside and then you want to have a little bit of air pressure in the tube so it doesn't actually move and one thing you can do too is usually the side with the valve stem because the valve stem has a place where it's actually glued on there it'll actually be stiffer there so place that part where the valve stem is where the cardboard now is then put the inner tube back in the tire and again very important you don't want this piece to move so when you're doing this you want to make sure that your finger is where the piece of cardboard is nice and centered make sure you put the valve stem there as you can see and now I'm literally holding the piece of cardboard here I could feel where it is if you look closely you might be able to see the cardboard through the tire then just place the tire on the rim get it all back on there and again I prefer using my hands for all of this but you know you can use a tire lever as well to put it on nothing against it it's just I'm actually quicker just using my hands but there's people that are a lot faster using the tire lever so I'll show you the end of that using that technique in all you just put the tire lever and this time you can actually do it underneath both sides of the beats so as you can see I have the tire lever through both sides of the bead of the tire and I'm just going to like kind of hoist it up and over the rim and that will get both sides on there pretty quickly I just wiggle it out and usually you'll get to a point where the other part of the tire gets on first and you have a majority of that side on and then you're just left with the last bit which again I usually use by hand but you can do with the tire over and there you go now we're just going to pump it up alright so get this nice and pumped up and see the work all right as you can see the cardboard actually did its job the tube isn't bulging there anymore and they should be able to get you home and like I said earlier this isn't a full time fix it's just a temporary thing to get you out of a bind but it will work to get you home and then after that they'll replace it alright so another thing that happened to tires besides actually getting holes on the top tread is getting a sidewall blow-ups so as you can see here we have a hole in the shadow' tire where I can actually shove my whole finger through it this actually didn't just happen I actually grabbed a pair of scissors and stabbed it just to demonstrate what this could look like because we didn't have any tires with a sidewall block but you can do the same solution which is using the piece of cardboard placing under here cutting it out and then placing the tire back on and that will get you out of the bind another thing you can do is if you have any tires laid around you can actually cut these and you can do quite a bit of different things with this keep in mind that there's this metal beat that goes on the inside of tire so when you're cutting tires you actually want to cut on the sidewall first because usually that's the thinnest part and then you can use the tread to you know patch your tire so be very careful when using scissors and all this other stuff preferably if you're not 18 or at least 17 you know don't do this by yourself have a parent help you or something but initially again you just want to stab the sidewall get the scissors and then start cutting away at the tread you're going to need and the tread is usually thicker so like I said cut this piece here you can be a little sloppy with it just cut this piece out you can actually just pick the tread you want and go across and then again come to the side with the side wall that will be easier to cut just it's really thin and let's say you're going to actually repair the top piece again where I replace it with cardboard so this portion here so you can actually cut a piece that's actually going to cover a good amount of that area and there you go you got a nice three inch by three inch almost like perfect square here cutting around there and this would be actually easier because since it follows the similar size and shape to the tire you can literally just get it underneath the tube and place it right where that spot was and then inflate it again or if you're just going to be repairing the sidewall blowout you can actually cut it in half again so cut it down here keep in mind when cutting the top tread it's a lot harder because it's supposed to be thicker you know and there you go when it comes to this don't worry about overkill you actually want more surface area being protected than less so yet this piece will do fine put her back in here and just patch her up the last thing I want to show you guys all right so let's say you have an old inner tube as a flat in it what you can do is literally just cut this off stem off oh man just ruin my sure this stuff had like being slime in it so avoid using anything with slime I hate it and then get your tire got a nice little animal tire here and then place the inner tube just like you would a regular tube on the inside of the tire and then all I have to do is place your good tube over it and what that'll do is it'll act like a little thorn resistant shield and yeah it's a little heavy and whatnot but again if you're going through an area that's really full of thorns and stuff like that and you need a quick fix both the cardboard the tire or even just a tube lining the outside of the inner tube and protecting your tube from thorns or anything like that really does help yep so let's slime really did ruin my new TCU shirt so that sucks but you know it is where it is and now I'm getting blown by the Sun anyhow I hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial again this tutorial was meant to get you out of a quick bind you know you're stuck at a street spot or a skate park you don't really know how to get home because you pedaled there so again you can use a piece of cardboard you can use an aluminum can actually works just be careful the aluminum can can get very sharp so I want you guys getting cut home you can use a Snickers or a skittles wrapper or anything like that that'll just you fold over enough times so where you have like a little protective layer for the tube wherever the hole isn't the tire and that'll get you home you know five how to do this many times back in my day and you know it's something I picked up along the way and hopefully something's going to get you out of a bind so that's going to do it for me today and once again I really appreciate you guys all checking out my videos and if you liked the video don't forget to Like share comment and most importantly

        "video_title": "Survival Bow And Spear For Hunting And Fishing.",
        "video_sub_title": "I recommend addressing a fast Hey today I'm sure here make two hunting weapons now one's going to be a bow telephone beer keep a mind though this is not a permanent boat as those not going to last you for years and years and years a boat like that would take a long time to process and the mate you know right now I have gotten lucky before I made a small little dough for a kid you know just to play with the time that turns out as we speak right now it still has its spring it was never unstrung it was green when I made it now it's bone-dry and it still has a pretty good I'm not a shrink to it so I got lucky and you might get lucky every now and again now this is Hickory Hickory is a great would make boats out of because it's very springy and it's pretty strong okay now when you select your staff like to use one about my height it's not a little taller and obviously that's going to be a long boat you can make smaller ones but this is just what I like to do okay you want you want it as straight as possible all those little knots as possible and so on now of course the base is going to be a lot thicker so what you have to do is you have to try and thin it out to make it close to as even at the top you can use a knife you can use a hatchet a rock you can grind it down you know whatever now you want to eat a very strong core of course now I use paracord of course but you can use criminal cordage it's just going to take a while to make this it's going to be under a lot of stress most of the time now first I like make a slipknot and I slip it over the end and then I'll tie it on this end okay there's a lot of rope here and I didn't want to cut it so that explains the big ball of not now you can do a round turn into a hitches right here which is also often referred to as a bow knot or a Bowman Tanakh but once you loop it a good way to string it and a little work to bend it so you can string it is to pilot succeed on camera knocks home to put the camera down there's a little bit all right take the bow and put it through your leg hook your leg back into it so that's hooked and stuck on the ground and then just bend all right and there you go that is a very quick makeshift bow now one of the more difficult parts of making survival bows and stuff like that is finding arrows now in reality you can use a lot of different things you can use woody grasses or you can use trees you can use virtually anything you could even use on metal shafts if you're in an urban environment certain times of metal cats now certain kinds of woody grasses as well recommend cuz they're a very light when they're dry and they're actually surprisingly strong as far as making the Arrowhead goes you can do stone you can do ten you can do bone or you can burn hardened it or a fire hardened it fire hardening would probably be the best sense of all situation due to the fact that it's the easiest and simplest all you do take the arrow and you stick it in the fire until it starts to burn then you can grind it on a rock so it gets to a point stick it back on the fire grind and grind it grind - grab it - it's a sharp point and that's going to be very very very hard wood because what it is the heat from the fire is something all the moisture or burning all the moisture out of it leaving fire hardwood and fire hardwood is some of the most hard this wood there is but anyway so I'm going to go try and find an arrow to use for this and I'll see y'all then what you want to look for this is very skinny straight saplings like these or branches like this anything like that and you could all grind it down to proper size on stone or use your knife or I mean whatever your imagination to limit as far as tools go out in the woods all right so I can cut myself with a stick I'm going to use my knife to thin it out properly and I'll see y'all there okay go so ideally you can want this a little thinner you just want to dry and you want fletchings right here but this will work great for just bow fishing you really don't need fletchings for bow fishing so go fishing you'd actually want this a little longer but this is this will be fun okay just like a little arrow one end you got the nock sharp into a point on the other side and it's straight is you want it now one way you can measure to see if the arm the arrow is long enough is to basically pretend like you're drawing a bow pull that see how it fits just like you would an arrow all right that's how you know that this is arrow will work fine now fletchings you can use leaves you could use bark you could use oh crap duct tape any tape feathers I think I've even heard of people using leather hide or animal hide I think I've heard of people using that once again improvise adapt overcome use whatever is at hand to accomplish the given task now this is going to be efficient arrow there should be one Monica modification I recommend you do along this part of the arrow make notches like little hooks what that's going to do it's going to help keep the fish on the arrow when you go to pull it back and also I'd recommend you put a notch nothing knock but the notch back here for you tie string to tie to your bow or your hand that way if you do get something you ain't going on lose the arrow and the fish and waste food this isn't a permanent bow this is in a permanent arrow for a long term for a long term arrow but they can work now the notch isn't quite the nock isn't quite as deep as I'd like it to be but it works so just like you would any other bow okay so now you got a primitive hunting weapon you can take medium game with this like pigs or you can make one stronger you can take larger games with your deer remember I make the shot count and you're not going to be able to do this like a modern bow you don't have to get closer but it's not anywhere near as strong so let's go shoot this in the creek and see how it does and that good shala pitch a recommendation or when you're shooting that fish I wasn't really shooting that fish I was just shooting into the creek treating the creek but if you're really trying to get a fish I recommend as you aim just below the fish not on him but below him maybe an inch or two below one because water reflects or refracts is that the light what a great way to st. for cracks and so reflects the light so it basically you could be standing over here now you can't see the fish but the fish you can see you the fish is not really or it appears to be in the water okay let's say as a fish here now if you shoot directly at the fish you want you here just above them and scare them away you guys shoot down here so you can nail him okay no that's a makeshift bow let's go let's talk about spear okay y'all so you have two kinds of primary types of spheres you have your thicker tougher defensive spheres that's when I help try and keep predators away from you Mike for instance I would make this into a very big bulky table okay they're charging me ideally jab it's round and bam or at least that's what the D is used to do or I don't know you see it in the movies all the time it there's plenty of stories of it actually working but in reality what you'd really be using it for his and you know I mean you know the Coyotes come and try and pick one of you to jab at him or whatever as a last last last stop last resort defensive maneuver you know bears coming at you poke him in the eyes you won't try and you know show them okay just this boy so a heck of a fight I don't wanna mess with him he's not easy food okay now you see it in the movies whole time people take their knives eyelashes hemisphere okay okay now you guys fearful but what if you lose your spirit what's your spear sticking something and that something runs away okay now your Spears go on which means your knife is gone your ultimate survival tool that you had the size of your brain is now gone okay so yeah so the thicker will both gear a good defensive sphere okay then you got your pine Spears what's our lot thinner a little smaller and if we have multiple points this will be a great fishing spear now if you're doing game hunting with the spear you would take this extra point off and just use it like you would a defensive sphere but you'd have notches and I'll have stuff like that in here I said that way you're doing flippin maximum damage now everything you stab now as a fishing spear this would be great because it's got two points but I wouldn't use it like this as a fishing spear or frog giggin spear or whatever I will take this right here all I split it four ways I'd use the barbs or I would take a whole bunch of narrow stitch thickness about like that and i lash them on here and spread them out so that I've got basically like a harpoon okay now I'm not gonna do the defensive sphere but I will set this up like I normally would so y'all can see what I'm talking about okay okay so I got going on here is a four prong spear if I did is I split it into four quarters so you got one two three four now what you want to do you want to take a dead stick push it down in there take another one push it down into the opposite way okay so now you've got four chances take your animal instead of just one so BAM this would be great for fishing spear you could even do this with your fishing arrows now what you want to do if you're going to do it like this let's take cord and wrap it real tight right here at the base of the split so that it won't split all the way down the wood now this is got not in it so that's why I add extra strength to the to hold out the split but you see what I'm saying now your spear you want kind of long you want it over your head tall maybe six foot seven foot sometimes eight foot depending on what kind what you're doing okay now this concludes my video on two counts of hunting tools I'll CEO next one flight to subscribe comment every single morning yells appreciated thank you all see y'all tomorrow you",

        "video_title": "When And How Should You Tell Your Child They're Autistic|Purple Ella",
        "video_sub_title": "hi Purple Ella  here and welcome back to my channel today as promised I'm going to talk to you about sharing a child's autism diagnosis with that child so this is something that becomes an issue after your child has been diagnosed on the autistic spectrum you may then start to wonder whether and how to share that diagnosis with your child so this became an issue for us when super kid was diagnosed aged 8 and when wondergirl was diagnosed aged 5 we had to think about what we were going to do with that information and whether we were going to share it with them so I thought I would talk to you a little bit about our experiences and my thoughts about that since years have past from having had those diagnoses in hopes that it might be useful to someone else so super kid was the first person in this house to be diagnosed as autistic and the motivation I had for sharing his diagnosis with him at that time was that although I didn't need to tell him I would need to tell his teachers and I would need to tell some of the people as supervise his activities and his some of his family who take care of him and have him to visit and even some of the Friends of his friends some of the parents of his friends in case that information like say he goes on a sleepover or a birthday party that's somewhere that's more challenging for him so when I recognized how many other people I was going to have to tell it seemed to me A unfair that they would all have this information about him that he didn't have about himself and B fairly likely that if I didn't find the right way space and time to share that diagnosis with him somebody else might accidentally let it slip and that would be a worse way for him to find out actually since having had the diagnosis for over three years now and having processed what autism means for us as a family a lot more my motivation for sharing wondergirls diagnosis with her which was only 18 months ago was that but was also that autism isn't something to be ashamed of it's not a disease and it's not something wrong with us it's it's a part of who we are and so it seemed like just as I would tell her that she's got blue eyes and just as I would tell her our family background and the things that make our family who we are I would tell her that she's autistic because it's just another one of those puzzle pieces in the picture of who my daughter is and it's not something that should be a terrible terrible news so I have several motivations for sharing that diagnosis and my third motivation for sharing the diagnosis kind of straightaway is that my children at the time were younger and in my experience younger children can be more adaptable to big news than say preteens and teenagers because everything that they everything in the world is fairly new to them so new information is just that new information you can tell them some quite important pieces of information and it just becomes another piece of information I'm not saying that they wouldn't have feelings and that they wouldn't worry but I would say that a younger child told that they are autistic and grown up knowing that they are autistic would have an easier time adapting to that than a child who struggles but has no idea that they're autistic and suddenly when they're 13 when they're 14 they find out they've got that diagnosis right at that point in time when they're going through the whole Who am I separate from my parents what am I about Who am I angst that would be quite difficult for them to receive at that time so those are my motivations for sharing my autism my children's autism diagnosis with them kind of almost straightaway obviously the choice is yours and obviously this is just my experience and I'm not judging anyone for the way that they choose to handle this information but I will now get in a little bit into how I think this information can be ideally handled and passed on so first of all I would think strongly about who is the best person to share that information with the child it might be you as their mother or you as their father it might be that they get on really especially well with a grandparent or an aunt and they're always calm when they're around them and you might want them with you when you share that information so kind of choose the people that your child finds it easy to talk to about real feelings and real stuff to be there to support sharing that news and in most cases that's going to be you as their parent which is great and I also think it's really important to choose the right moment to share this information I say that as someone who has a tendency to really just blurt out information when it comes into my head and not give any thought to whether the other person is ready to receive that information and that's equally important if you are talking to a child as it is if you're talking to an adult obviously so choose a time when there's not other stuff going on you're not likely to be interrupted it's a calm point in the day you're not likely to feel hurried and you are able to be as patient as you need to be and your child is in the right state of mind not feeling a bit meltdown II not feeling a bit anxious you know in that right state of mind choose that time you can do things that are more likely to set up that right state of mind for example I did a the early bird plus course after super kid was diagnosed and we talked about sharing diagnosis and one lady had sat down with her daughter and had made a picture of me picture of her because her daughter loved art so they had made a picture all about her maybe she was into football maybe she was into this maybe she was into that they cut out stuff and stuck it on there and kind of tried to some out up who she was in this in this piece of art which had calmed her daughter down nicely because that was something that tended to calm her down and then led really nicely into that discussion whereby she could then say another thing about you is that you are autistic and let's think about what that means and maybe we want to add that to your art so it's just another thing about you and I thought that was a really fantastic way to handle it for a child that enjoys being crafty and being creative so try and find the right mood the right situation and the right person to have this discussion with your child emphasize that autism is not a disease some children might react to being told having seen some doctors that they have something wrong with them as thinking that they have a disease that might physically cause them some kind of harm or that they might die of or they might have any kinds of worries around that so I think it's important that you emphasize that autism is a difference not a disease and then you can talk about the ways in which autism is different and the ways in which their autism makes them special you can also talk about the fact that sometimes autism can bring them challenges and you can talk about the kinds of challenges they might have had and how now that you know that that that they are autistic you can work together to overcome those challenges and that whilst it might be hard they can overcome them don't make it too long don't give them too much information make it a discussion rather than a bombardment of information because a autistic people don't tend to take in a huge amount of verbal information particularly effectively and be the more engaged that they are in the discussion they're more than that they're going to be taking in and the shorter that this period of time is the more they're going to be able to remember it and it's going to be significant however after the event of sharing the information make yourself readily available for further questions and further discussion make it clear to them that this is something that you will return to anytime that they want to and that they can come to you with any questions that they've got because it might be that their processing speed is slower because of their autism and that they might come up with something but it's the day later or it's a week later or it's a month later keep that conversation going with them I would say that it can be really useful to use resources so for example the thing that I always used when talking to my children about having had a diagnosis but also in terms of recommending to school to show to my children's friends and recommending to the parents and my children's friends to show to them is a short video that was made originally for news round here in the UK but I believe you can definitely find it on YouTube and it's called my autism and me and it's it's presented by Rosie King who is a relatively well known autistic person and is also happens to be a delight to watch and really presents it well and everyone that I've shown video 2 has found it a really useful because it gives three different examples of three different presentations of autism from her brother who's kind of climbing on the television and filling the bathroom full of bubbles to her autism which is less obvious but she explains the ways in which effects her and then a third presentation of autism to so I think it's a really good overview into not only what autism is but how autism can look very different for different people and how we're all people and I know that that's been really useful for my children in exploring their autism diagnosis so there are many books that you can use I'm not gonna recommend any specific books because there are so many books that I think if you just have a look on I'm gonna say Amazon but feel a bit guilty about that I have a little look on Amazon or wherever you prefer to buy your books and and have a look what you think your child's gonna relate to because all children are different and what I what I might have found was great for since the firm Wonder Girl was definitely not great for super kid and and so whatever's great for them is not going to necessarily be great for your child however this leads me nicely into something I wanted to talk to you about today separately which is pro anything that is pro autism as a strength and a fantastic thing about you is gonna help your child feel good about who they are just like we try to focus on what's good about us to keep ourselves afloat and so through the years I've come across quite a few different people who make products that are about celebrating autism and Pro Newton neuro diversity and one of the people I've come across during that time is just someone that I know through Twitter and her name is Beth Wilson this is Beth Wilson let me show you her this is an animation and animation this is a drawing of Beth but Beth actually looks like that I've never met her but I've seen pictures of herself that she shed and she really she looks like that so that's great and she lives fairly locally to me though we've never met and so I've been quite into in her work because she is an artist and I really love what she does so she makes neuro+ products is the best way that I can think of to put it and and stuff for the autism community to celebrate our autism and her art is absolutely fantastic and I really love it and so I really wanted what I really wanted to do was actually bring her stuff and show it to you so that you could see how lovely her stuff is she sells it on a Etsy website and I can leave the link to her Etsy shop which is sorry I'm having to use a piece of paper because of brain frog brain frog her Etsy shop is doodle best shop but I will also leave a link and so she has sent me very kindly a bunch of stuff to show you so the first thing that we have is these are great for kids I think I would imagine that wonder girl will be claiming this off me late later it's a wristband and it says autistic and then it's got this is the symbol that a lot of neuro-diverse people are opting to use as opposed to say the jigsaw puzzle piece to represent neurodiversity so it's an infinity symbol and I really like that idea and it's kind of um it's kind of just a nice way of a alerting people to the fact that you are autistic and be being proud of that fact so she also sent me a lanyard lanyards are really really useful when you have autistic children because you can click on two lanyards de schedules sensory toys - toys I find them really handy so this is just a really lovely neurodiversity symbol infinity symbol lanyard I'm gonna wear that she also sent me a neuro fabulous sticker which I was debating whether I could get it in my car I quite fancy having that in my car but neuro fabulous yeah baby she sent me an autistic keyring it's not gonna it's not gonna sit nicely an autistic keyring with again that neurodiversity infinity side this is my favorite it's an autistic pin badge which I might need to wear autistic yes I am what of it she said me and finally she sent me three little I love these kinds of badges because I cover my bags and my jackets in them little little pin badges I've got quite a lot of them one of them says autistic one of them says neuro fabulous which I think is my favorite neuro fabulous and the final one is just the little infinity symbol again the autism infinity symbol she also makes which I don't have buy noticed and I want to tell you about little pin badges just like that one of them is talked to me and one of them is I don't know whether it's actually talked to me or leave me alone but there to indicate whether you're in the mood for being social or whether you're not and I really like that idea because I've seen that done in a variety of different ways but I quite like the idea of it being a slightly more sort of subtle small tin badge rather than a wristband or something a little bit more obvious and taking up space so bit random just to sort of show you this but I actually think this stuff is ideal when you're thinking about how to think about autism when you're talking to your child about it and it might be that you're already tip-top all-over neuro fabulousness and you already have a really positive attitude towards autism and it might be that you've just received the diagnosis and you don't fully know what that means and you're scared and you're worried and both of those feelings are completely valid but I would say that when dealing with your child and sharing that information with your child the best that you can possibly do to make this a positive thing that you are not worried by and that you are going to celebrate with them the better so I hope this video was helpful next week I'm going to talk about autism and adolescence and every time I see that in my schedule I feel slightly terrified because adolescence was not easy for me and I don't think it's easy for many autistic teens and it feels like a massive topic so if there's something you would specifically like me to discuss regarding autism and adolescents then do leave me a comment in the comment box below and I will endeavor to include that in my video also if you have a way that you've shared the autism diagnosis with your child that you think might be useful for other people also leave a comment in the comment box below because everybody reads the comments and then we can all share the love and the information that we've got so that's great if you like the video do like it and if you have not yet subscribed to my channel subscribe right now sorry little bit up this week um and I will see you next week bye bye",

        "video_sub_title": "I appreciate you joining I hope that you are doing well how to prevent and treat cavities and tooth decay naturally a lot of people doubt the possibility of healing cavities naturally because it's been drilled into us that filling cavities with dentistry is the way to achieve healing but that simply isn't the case many people have healed their own cavities and their children's cavities so it can be done many doctors and dentists have backed the findings of a study suggesting their diets can in fact help those suffering with cavities to reverse their tooth decay while we've been led to believe that tooth decay occurs when foods containing sugars and starches are left on the teeth this study shows there are more factors at work there are four main things that contribute to tooth decay lack of minerals in the diet deficiencies of magnesium calcium and phosphorus lack of fat soluble vitamins a d e and K too much consumption of phytic acid rich foods too much consumption of processed sugar if you want healthy cavity free teeth sugar cannot be a part of your diet not only does it feed oral bacteria that prevents a healthy flow of dental fluids it's also highly acidic allowing it to decalcify and demineralize the structural content of teeth beating tooth decay requires an increase in fat soluble vitamins and minerals a diet full of vegetables especially leafy green vegetables and foods high in healthy fats such as coconut oil and avocado along with nuts and seeds can help create the ideal diet for battling tooth decay oil pooling has been used for centuries as an oral detoxification procedure simply swish a tablespoon of coconut oil in your mouth for 20 minutes then spit the oil into the trash if 20 minutes is too long start with three to five minutes oil pooling has been praised for its ability to treat numerous health shoes from gingivitis to headaches phytic acid is a mineral blocker and enzyme inhibitor that's found in grains nuts seeds and beans that are not organic or GMO free it can cause serious health problems such as mineral deficiencies and osteoporosis phytic acid prevents you from absorbing the minerals in your food while leaching minerals out of your body bones and teeth avoid foods high in phytic acid by choosing organic and GMO free fluoride free toothpaste can be expensive but there are some brands that are more affordable than others you can also make your own toothpaste at home please click on the link above or in the description to watch my other video two things generally occur when a tooths nerve root becomes irritated the most common causes of tooth aches are infection decay injury or loss of a tooth while no one enjoys a painful tooth the good news is that tooth pain and infections can usually be relieved and healed naturally the most popular home remedy for toothaches is the use of garlic which has been passed down for years try applying a crushed garlic clove or garlic powder to the area it may burn but the pain could vanish within minutes but sometimes it might take longer repeat this over a few days as needed you can also try grandmother's remedy for toothache pain it is pepper and salt mix equal amounts of pepper and sea salt with a few drops of water to form a paste apply the paste directly on the affected tooth and allow it to sit for a few minutes do this daily for several days close our traditional remedy for numbing nerves but clove oil needs to be used carefully to apply the clove oil soak a cotton ball or swab with the oil and use it to wipe on and around your sore gums and tooth repeat as needed ginger and cayenne paste can relieve a painful toothache mix equal parts of these two heats packing spices with enough water to make a paste roll a small ball of cotton into enough paste too saturated then place it on your tooth while avoiding your gums and tongue leave it until the pain fades or as long as you can stand it turmeric is used by many as a natural toothache treatment just a teaspoon of turmeric powder in a small amount of purified water is enough to make a healing paste which can be applied to the area or applied on a cotton ball to be placed in your mouth the turmeric can also be mixed with honey or cayenne ingesting turmeric or turmeric supplement would also be beneficial if the toothache is a result of an abscess or another infection start with several drops of oregano oil under the tongue and hold for a few minutes then swish around colloidal silver as many times as once per hour after a few hours ingest additional colloidal silver but not more than a total of 8 ounces in one day in between the colloidal silver swishes perform a warm saltwater swish using preferably sea salt and rub more oregano oil into your gums to help relieve inflammation and infection take one teaspoon of black seed oil and half a cup of vinegar and boil cool and then use as a mouth rinse to reduce inflammation and infection rinse every couple of hours until the pain or swelling is gone I hope that these home remedies provide you with the relief that you need please also share in the comments what has worked and what hasn't worked for you thank you for watching good day and good health",

        "video_sub_title": "hey guys it's me Brianna and this is going to be a another video this time I'm gonna show you guys how doing contour highlight full-face not including that since right on how to get like a really soft contour it's a bit of blush a little bit of glow a little bit of this a little bit now we will continue to watch okay so I'm going to go ahead and play my foundation first I usually apply a liquid and when apply cream foundation this times I'd like to switch it up and show you guys different ways to apply different products so I recommend cream foundation for those who have dry skin I'm dry to normal I have pretty oily skin so I don't really use cream often however cream is great for full coverage also if you set it with a powder it can be amazing so I'm just using black opals foundation I am in the color nutmeg the one thing I do like about cream foundation is that you can do so much with it if you apply a little bit of lotion to it you can turn it into a liquid foundation cream foundation you can apply this concealer it's a lot more pigmented a lot more full coverage can thin it down a little bit of moisturizer and make it a BB cream or a very very very light coverage and there are another great thing about cream foundation is that it is super buildable you can constantly apply more layers one thing I will say about cream foundations though is if you find the cream foundation is creasing you're probably applying way too much I'm just applying my cream foundation with a flat top foundation brush your foundation should always match your neck um it shouldn't match your face it should match your neck make sure that you have leaned into your ears so your entire face is the same exact color no1pablo of concealer I'm going to be using a black opals even true concealer I swear black opal did not sponsor this look however um I do like the products and a few months ago they did send me quite a few other products such as this concealer I really liked it like I was like wow and it's super inexpensive so this is definitely like my drugstore concealer it's like if I go to work if I'm going out like out to eat or something and I don't want to wait if I'm going out to eat or like going to work and I want to wait you still like my $40 concealer I will definitely put this on it does the job I like to use my fingers to blend out my concealer but you know you don't have to use your fingers and then I just like to take this beauty blender tool it damp and I just like to blend out the edges now that some concealer use under-eye I'm going to do my nose a tad bit I'll say this I don't like doing heavy contours or me found my thing some people love a heavy contour more power to them I just don't prefer so I'm gonna take this I'm just going to apply a straight line between my nose I don't do um a heavy contour my nose I do like to bring the dimension back into my face the color back into my face and kind of gained a few pounds so I do like for everything with a little bit slimmer but I don't like going overboard with it so now I'm just gonna take this Beauty Blender and I'm going to go in and when the Sun hits your face the sudden naturally hits your forehead and actually it's your cupid bow it naturally hits your nose it naturally hits this the darker areas are going to be if you can like look at my face really good right now the dark areas of my face is right here pretty much to outer outer so this this this this and then where your cheekbones pop up the hollows of your cheeks is going to be where that contour that dark spot hits now I'm just taking am just going to blend it out I'm going to go in with my sleek contour kit it's the powder base you can't use the liquid take the sleek contour kit in the color door and I'm going to take a I'm not sure what you brush this is oh it's a taper brush and I'll put that down below take a little bit of that I'm just going to go ahead and put that line on my nose now take a little bit of my black opal powder you can use any type of powder you want I like black opal I do have a Sacha confidence in my kit it's great but for me I don't really use a lot of high-end makeups I wear it so often so I'm just like a little bit this black opal powder I was going to go ahead and just get underneath my eye to set the foundation because cream you definitely want to set so it won't move all around you guys noticed I did not apply the concealer right here right here sometimes I do sometimes I don't for a really natural contour I don't so my videos you'll see I'll do like I'll love it and I look really really like chisel I'm not doing it for this clip again is going to be more of a natural contour so now I'm going to take my sleek contour kit again and I'm going to take a angle brush just going to apply that to the hollows of my cheek I'm not giving myself that race car line I'm just going to do a very very soft contour again it's just to add dimension back into your face so you guys can see the sec of my cheeks my contour it's right there so I'll take it right there I'm just going to dust that out blend it in I'm you're not dust it out now just go ahead and just blend out that powder and I blend out that powder I use to make my contour line a little more short it was time for blush I'm going to be using my be a bombshell cosmetics miss blushes please you guys know I usually use my cargo Lagoona blush I'm love with that blush my absolute favorite this time because I do have kind of a purplish pink guy going on I'm going to go ahead and do a blush a pink blush to kind of match that so I will recommend this woman of color when you are looking for a blush go with our skin tone they pre complexions we don't blush um so getting these pasty pinks um they're not gonna work just gonna make us look ashy black moon are not meant to blush so you apply these pastel blushy colors onto our cheeks we look crazy um hot pink is a great calm color orange is a great color those dark Browns are great colors because they're not that pop that pace tail color they're more of the vibrant colors are there more of a mellow so I'm taking this pink I'm going to apply Barry Broome lightly because you can always apply more can apply less and it's going to take it I don't like a lot of blush but if you do like a lot blush you can just always apply in layers applying a layer is just going to allow your blush to look more natural anyway think about blush is that if you feel like oh my god I apply way too much take a little bit of your face powder and then go over it and that's going to lighten up the look now it's time to apply the one of the most popular things these days which is their bronzer that glow that highlight is like everybody wants to highlight these days I do too not gonna like um so I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to take a few I'm gonna take my afterglow bronzer and this is by Ruby kisses picking on my model coal and this is like a blush bronzer type deal and I'm just gonna swab a little bit of that oh that's way too much yeah way too much so pigmented and I'm gonna play them if like you applied way too much and you feel like a crystal ball just go in with your face powder go over a little bit so it's not as glowing just like that guys so now it's time for the lips I don't know what my know if the lips I'm still thinking what do if my little bit of brown lip liner just line my lips so this is the finished look hope you guys enjoyed this video put your two thumbs up so you have not subscribed to my channel please make sure you do so until next time I'll talk to you guys later love you bye",

        "video_sub_title": "okay let's talk level of consciousness level of consciousness along with pupillary reaction are going to be two of your most important components of your neurological exam this helps not only on like a neuro ICU where I work but this also is very important when working anywhere in a hospital being able to assess neurological status appropriately is incredibly important so what we're going to do is we're going to go through the levels of consciousness and we're going to talk about the differences and how they apply and everything so first of all what you'll notice is if you have a patient who's conscious so what you'll say is you'll say when you start a neurological neurological report or exam you'll say a no times blank whatever okay that that's going to be three or four okay that's gonna depend on where you work but basically what we're trying to determine is does the patient know their name location and the date sometimes we'll also include situation in that basically a person who is conscious is able to state those three things they're awake they're able to go into themself the place the time you know if they're sleeping and everything like that you can also give them time they're they're able to wait from their sleep and they're able to be alert and pay attention in a wakeful state so what you'll say is you'll say alert and oriented times three or alert norio times four depending on where you work if you do four different components of it or three different components of it but this is the highest level of consciousness and this is what we're hoping for this way one all of our patients to be now right below that will have confused so people who are confused they're going to be disoriented impaired and they're thinking and in their responses so this would be a patient who may be a and O times 1 ano times 2 they may be confused to the location they might have time loss and this could be caused by by sleep deprivation malnutrition allergies environmental pollution drugs and infection but we're looking for especially in a hospital setting is this decrease in consciousness due to some sort of neurological pathology is this due to a stroke is this due to seizure tumor is this dude what does this do - why are they are is the patient septic again that would be kind of like the infection so again when they're confused they're disoriented they may not be able to come up as quickly or at all - their name the location and time and this can absolutely happen these patients can go from a very alert state and a very conscious level of consciousness - confused very quickly and so it's important to assess that very often in the neurological ICU we assess level of consciousness at least every two hours sometimes every one hour sometimes even more depending on the patient's condition from confused we're gonna pass on to delirious delirious patients are going to be very disoriented they're gonna be Restless they may have hallucinations and sometimes delusions so this may even you might notice this in like an Alzheimer's patient they may become delirious at night you'll have your sundowners now but delirious has a level of consciousness means that this is where this person lives they're restless they're agitated and and they're just unable to to respond to you appropriately they're awake but their orientation is very askew okay now from that we're gonna go to somnolent what's the difference between somnolent and delirious the biggest difference between Summerlin and delirious is that they're sleepy okay but the problem with this is this is an excessive drowsiness and and in order to get them to even respond you have to provide stimuli okay and even when they do respond it might just be mumbles or dis Oregon does organized movements so you you pinch their their trapezius or their or their quad and they just mmm he'll just mumble they're not going to say words or anything like that but they're incredibly drowsy they may keep their eyes closed and it's not possible to even get them to open their eyes just recently in my hospital we had a patient who was transferred from another floor the patient was preparing to go home but over there on the other floor that patients family noticed that the patient became more somnolent they were more and more drowsy they stopped opening their eyes so a CT scan was ordered as found the patient had dramatic hydrocephalus so much so that like say this is the CT scan this is their their head that just a tremendous portion of their of their head was filled with fluid okay so I brought the patient over to our ICU and very rapidly we provided interventions we gave mannitol and we inserted inserted an EVD and we've talked about that previously but so the somnolence is excessive sleepiness you're not able to get them to you have to have to do the sternal rub and that's one thing you'll you'll need to learn and your neurological exams is going to be sternal rub you",

        "video_title": "How to Stop Ghrelin, the Hunger Hormone (Hormonal Impacts of Low carb and Low Fat Diets)",
        "video_sub_title": "hello this is Ford Brewer with prep med preventive medicine why have a heart attack stroke disability diabetes why not avoid all those prevention is better than treatment today we're going to talk about ghrelin the hunger hormone very interesting topic the topic was raised for me by a Jenny rule in the book diet 101 I'll talk about that in a few minutes but here's an image of the hunger hormone starting with ghrelin it's made by the stomach an empty stomach when the stomach gets stretched it actually decreases grill and secretion insulin we talked about multiple times not going to go into that today leptin is made by the adipose or fat tissue leptin decreases your appetite the more fat you have the more leptin you make pyy is another set of dietary suppressant hormone it's made by the small intestines it's very recently discovered as is ghrelin just over the past decade so there's a lot of information that we still don't know that we're still finding out as I mentioned a few minutes ago ghrelin the hunger hormone is made by a stomach and secreted by a stomach this empty when you eat food stretch out that stomach lining and you get a decrease of the ghrelin production well what are the other things we need to know about ghrelin well first of all again it is the hunger hormone no other hormone is known to generate hunger like it does there's some association with others but we'll talk about those later ghrelin as I said as in is secreted by an empty stomach makes sense doesn't it for fraud hunger hormone and it also stops decreasing with secretions when the stomach's full also makes sense something else that makes sense is another function of ghrelin it decreases inflammation of the gut lining because of the hyperplasia of the gut lining and it actually stops apoptosis again another scientific word cell that it stops cell death and they've got lining in other words it prepares that gut lining for food it gives you what people call an iron stomach you can eat anything you're ready to eat number four there's a fourth vent interesting item about ghrelin it seems to simulate glucagon there's a lot of research that's going on recently regarding diabetes and diabetes treatment what they've done is they've knocked out insulin or beta cells among mice developed an insulin model for these patients or Mott for these mice knocked out the glucan glucagon and that stopped the insulin production but then they've had some challenges associated with ghrelin in that area actually that's a that's a whole different topic it has to do with insulin and diabetes research and treatment for the future right now for this video we're just talking about the hunger hormone ghrelin and a specific item around that hunger hormone the response to meals low carb meals versus high carb meals now again that topic was brought up to me by roll diet 101 and as I said before she she does some great research she found a study by a couple called kasym Caracas in the American Journal of nutrition basically what that study showed was the response to glucose insulin most of all ghrelin the hunger hormone adrenaline moans and androgens all of these things to a glucose challenge in other words a glucose tolerance test and compare that to a protein challenge or a protein tolerance test so here's the punchline if you look at here's the two lines for grilling if you look at this line this is the solid line is the protein challenge test the patients in this in this category were given just protein they were not given glucose at zero hour the hunger hormone is high down after I mean that one hour it's still high but it's dropped dropping dramatically between one and two hours and then it stabilizes the comparison though is the glucose challenge they gave them glucose only at one hour again the the ghrelin his time drops at two hours but look right an hour three four and five the ghrelin starts going right back up when the meal was glucose the implication here is that glucose doesn't hold you then you get hungry two hours after a of a hydrate meal and that you don't get hungry after a low-carb protein meal now is that because there were proteins in there and the proteins kept your ghrelin from growing up going back up or is that because there was no glucose this study doesn't deal with that issue but what it does indicate though is it's got some indication for protein versus carb low carb meals some other interesting information to pull out of this this is the response of glucose as might be obvious the glucose went up with a glucose challenge it did not go up blood glucose did not go up with the protein challenge you can see from the levels here at 150 these were not people that had normally functioning insulin mechanisms if it were they would have peaked for right here about 120 and gone back down that is the definition of insulin resistance these were Pecos patients called polycystic ovary syndrome and by definition had insulin resistance so again another thing and another advantage to low carb meals you don't get that fluctuation of blood glucose that is a very specific advantage for anyone with insulin resistance and diabetes you do get some fluctuation of insulin and this is the insulin chart and yes insulin did fluctuate but not as much as it did with the glucose challenge another interesting point again specifically for maybe specifically for the Pico stations the polycystic ovary patients who do have challenges with hormones both androgen hormones which are made by over overactivity of the ovaries and cortisol or adrenal hormones again much more fluctuation of those hormones as well with a glucose challenge so does this mean that low-carb meals have an advantage I think it's certainly in the case that it does what are the advantages will decrease fluctuation in blood glucose for sure that's a far bigger advantage if you have insulin resistance or diabetes I mean if you have normally functioning insulin mechanisms you're going to peak at about 120 anyway and come back down 80 to 90 so you're going to be going constantly between 80 and 120 once you get insulin resistance there you can go up much much higher and the low carb meal will keep you from doing that the other takeaway does this mean you'll get decreased hunger with low carb meals there's certainly evidence that that may be the case so again I think there's always more learn but some good evidence here",

        "video_title": "\u2606 How To: Install + Style Clip In Extensions (feat. abHair clip ins)",
        "video_sub_title": "what up people so today I'm doing this video on how to put in clip in extensions these extensions are by a be hair calm and they are 22 inches indian remy hair basically the hair is sent with these care extractions on how to take care of them and keep them nice also they come with two rings and if you order for your first time with a be hair calm they will send you two of these color rings so you can match up with your hair you know what color you are and if you throw on color they can always send you some more so anyways on to the specs about this hair as you can see the hair is really nice the luster is not that shiny it matches the luster of my hair which is great and there's not that much shedding I noticed a little bit of shedding when I was applying the clips but I mean that's pretty normal for hair human hair so the clips come with one long clip which has I think five clips on it it comes with one medium clip which comes with three and then it comes with one and two of these shorter clips with two clips and then there are five smaller clips that are just one clip so those are for like bang pieces and front pieces so altogether it comes with nine clips for your whole head for some people you may want to go a little longer or you may want more fullness you may need two bundles but I only need one so basically all I'm gonna do is put my hair so I can get it ready to be parted and what I like about these clippings is that they are very good quality and they matched my hair really well they and I believe this is a yaki texture so it matches natural african-american hair when it's straightened pretty well and it blends really easy so I can just stick it throughout my whole head without having me braid any of my hair for anything and it'll match the texture of my hair so basically as you can see I'm straightening this back piece here and I ended up moving that piece to the front so I'm not gonna leave it there but I'm just gonna show you guys how well it blends with my hair once I have flat ironed it and these clippings are a really good price they're on sale for I believe ninety seven ninety nine which is really good for one bundle of human hair or any extensions and they do have free shipping available for orders over I think sixty five dollars forty five dollars something like that I'll put all of the info in the description box so that you guys know all of the details so basically what you want to do is you want to make sure that you measure each clip to know if it'll fit on the part that you are putting it on so if you're going to lay your hair down you want to make sure that it matches up with the parting and it's not the clips are not sticking out on the sides or anything so I just measure it and then I'm flat ironing each piece cuz it does come in a body wave texture so I'm just flat ironing each piece and then sticking it where my part is you just slide that into your part and press the clips down this is a great way to add volume length or color dimension to your real hair without committing to a sewing or installing wig I find that we're using clip ins I can get a smooth more flat appearance and it doesn't really look like I have extensions it actually looks a lot like my real hair which is more believable to me and it's a lot less time and effort each day if you wanted to wear them of course you can't sleep in them or anything but I mean they do brought pretty well if you want to fool people you know what I mean if you just want to add onto your real hair clippings are also really resourceful if you wanted to have a really flat ponytail but have a really nice link to it that's really a really great way to kind of mask the fact that you have extensions in your head and it'll also help with versatility in styling like you want to do a half up half down or if you wanted to do to change up your part frequently or you want to do like a bun a really high bun you can just flip the clips upside down and see if you know that works for you better than doing a sew-in or something like that where you'd have to pull the hair up and have like a bump in the back it's really easy to do this with clipping so I find that clippings are actually really really helpful in giving that really flat natural appearance and as you can see I'm putting in this longer clip here and the longest clip is nine inches long and it has four clips on the weft so it's not gonna be short enough to fit on that part of my head so what I'm gonna do is take a shorter clip and this one has I believe three clips on it three or two I'll show it in a second but this clip is shorter and it'll fit better on the putts that I'm trying to clip the hair to and what I'm gonna do with the other clip with the four clips on it is apply that to a more long part of my hair so I'm gonna part up higher where I know my head is bigger in the back and I can put that clip there instead of putting trying to put it at a lower part of my head where it won't fit so when you're putting the clip ends and you want to just make sure that you know where each clip can go and that may take a little time or practice to figure out what Clips fit on what part of your head and using clip ins may be a little tough for you if your hair is naturally straight because I know some people can't get the clips to keep from sliding down their hair if it's too clean or if it's really straight at your root so if you want to help minimize slippage all you have to do is tease the root of your hair and then slide the clip ends in and it'll help to hold it better I notice that Clips stay in my hair better when my hair is less clean and straight when it's more dirty I know that sounds bad but over time your hair gets old and it holds better when the hair is old so I mean you know that's just the truth anyway as you can see I have a middle part now I decided to switch up to him in part because I was starting to notice that one side of my hair we're starting to get really thin from wearing my part on that side all the time so I'm gonna switch it up to a middle part for a little while and as you can see I'm putting the small single clips on that on either side of my parting so that I have a little fullness in the front and my bangs don't look so short and that way it blends better with V clips and now I'm just combing through the hair and making sure that it all blends seamlessly and I'm gonna turn to the back so that you guys can see what the hair looks like and as far as blending goes and then from the front I'm just gonna show you guys how long it is on me it comes about to my waistline but my belly button is so the hair is pretty long on the meters I'm kind of short and that's how you install the clipping so now I'm going to show you guys a few different options you can do if you don't like the way the clippings look when you just wear it down first I'm just twisting either side of my head back and I'm going to connect them both with bobby pins this is a really quick and easy way to kind of mask your bangs if your bangs are really short and they don't blend with the rest of the hair well you can just twist it up and mix it with the clips so that it looks like all of your hair is that long and then just twist it you know into a little ponytail in the back and you can either bobby pin it or you can wrap a band I'm gonna bobby pin it so I think bobby pins are more safe to use on your hair instead of a rubber band rubber bands kind of pull the hair out I'm just gonna bobby pin that and of course if you were gonna be wearing this out it would be a lot more neat I didn't really do it that but I mean you know you get the idea and then option number two you can take that down and the next look that I'm gonna do is a side braid so we're gonna pull all of our hair to the front and then we're going to move all of the hair to one side and basically what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take the hair split it into two different sections and then I'm going to braid each section and then with the braids I'm going to twist those braids together to kind of give it more of a different kind of braid the normal braid is kind of boring plus if you do one braid so like all of the hair if you have layers won't go into the braid well so what I do is take it and do two separate braids and that way you can get each little hair that sticks out better than if you were to just do one big braid so as you can see I'm braiding one side and now I'm braiding the other side and I'm gonna twist those two braids together and secure them both with a rubber band because it's not my hair I can put a rubber band on the end okay and the third style you can do is what I call my lucky estar braids and yes I know I look like her guys you don't have to tell me anymore I know anyway just two braids going down the front perimeter of your hair and I think this is so cute just because it's different not many people wear their hair like this but it's a really easy way to mix your bangs with the long hair and make it look like all of your hair is one length because sometimes my bangs really got my nerves because they're always flying in my face they don't match the rest of the hair because they're really really short so I'm just gonna take those pieces and braid them into a really long braid down to the front and when you're done you can just secure that with a rubber band and then you just braid the other side [Music] and there you have it my lucky estar braids just another way to make your hair mix in with the extensions if you feel like they don't or even if you just want to switch it up and have a cute little style you know for back-to-school or something like that and sorry I didn't move the camera back up so you guys can see the top flick I mean you get the idea and then of course because the clip ins help for your hair to lay down so flat you can always get away with a low pony a high ponytail whichever one you prefer I feel like with a middle part the low pony looks cuter so yeah all in all I really like these baby hair extensions like I said all the info will be in the description box thank you guys for watching and I'll talk to you guys soon [Music] you",

        "video_sub_title": "hi so today I'm going to show you how to do a hair donut bun so this is what a hair donut looks like in case you didn't know that already yeah it just pretty much looks like a donut so you can also get these in brown and I think you can also get them in black so yeah the color you get obviously depends on your own hair color so if you have brown hair you're obviously going to need a brown one because it won't show up in your hair as much you can get them at Claire's at H&M I think you can also get them at new look Primark at lots of stores you can get these nowadays I personally got mine at a store called action here in the Netherlands for like 70 cents I think so yeah pretty inexpensive well I think that at other stores they're probably a little bit more expensive but yeah they're reasonably priced I guess well it's only a donut so I don't know today I'm going to do a tutorial with it so most people wear these like this they put their hair in it like they would with a hair tie then they kind of wrap the hair around it like that pretty much they take the hair and like put a hair tie around it or something and then take the left over remaining hair and then just wrap it around the bun and secure that with bobby pins now you can do it like that but I am going to show you a different way to do it and the way that I'm going to do it just gives the bun a bit more volume and also you won't need any bobby pins for this because you're going to use your entire hair for this I'm going to show you how to do it so for this you need a brush a hair donut obviously and a hair tie you won't really need a hair tie but I would suggest one yeah I would really recommend one because it just makes things a lot easier so yeah now I'm just going to show you how to do it first you're just going to brush your hair like you would with pretty much every hairstyle I guess and then you're just going to brush your hair forward and make it nice and smooth and you're just basically going to make a ponytail so yeah I got a tangle teezer by the way that is the brush that I'm using it's like blue with hot pink it's kind of pretty see ya okay I'm making a ponytail and I'm brushing my bangs forward because I like that but if you don't have bangs you obviously don't need to do that but yeah okay so just make your hair smooth now you're just going to make a ponytail on the height that you want your bun to be so just make a ponytail you okay now I've got a ponytail just like that okay and then I'm going to take my hair doughnut and I'm going to put my hair in it like I would do with a hair tie just like that see and now lots of people what lots of people do is just wrap the hair around it and then put a hair tie around it and take the leftover hair wrap it around it and secure that with bobby pins but we're not going to do that because we're going to use all over hair so we're going to pull back the hair donut until we have a little bit of hair left and we just wrap that around the bun like that and try to spread it a little bit then which is going to push that back so more hair comes in here and comes out in this side just wrap that around and try to spread it all over the donut so yeah just do that and I've got layers so some hair is like poking out here but you're just going to try to put that in D donut if you have layers too and just pull back the donut which just makes here coming out of here so yeah I hope you understand what I'm saying it's a little bit hard to explain but it's actually really easy so yeah it's one of the simplest things ever and it gives a really nice luminous button so I really like it okay okay can see you so just try to wrap your hair around it like that and then just pull back the bun or a donut I mean well it's becoming a button now so yeah okay now you've got this left and just pull it back pull it back until you can't pull it back anymore and the hair tie is going in the donut as well if you pull it back as far as you can and that just pretty much gives you a button it's pretty FluMist and you use all your hair no bobby pins need it and this is not going anywhere anymore I I promise because I've done this a couple of times before and I went shopping with it and everything and it did not really move at all just make sure that your hair is like wrapped around Donuts very well and this is also why you need like a donut that is the same color as your hair you know why that is useful because it won't show up as much if some hair is not really wrapped around you donut very well but yeah this is what you donut looks like yeah okay and you can obviously also do it lower or higher if you want a sterling up to you it really just depends on where you put your ponytail um you know where you put your bunny tail that is where the bun will be so this is what mine looks like and this is seriously not going anywhere like I'm shaking my head like crazy right now you see they whoop whoop whoop okay going crazy I hear my neck cracking that is very disturbing good yeah it's not going anywhere like seriously and I really like it so yeah this way you will just use your entire hair and you will voluminous bun so yeah hope you like the button so I hope this video was somewhat helpful and informative and stuff and yeah I hoped you enjoyed watching this video and thank you so much for watching this video so if you want you can give this video a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel if you want and yeah again thank you so much for watching and I will hopefully see you later in

        "video_sub_title": "Gout is typically characterized by a sudden onset of acute pain, redness, and swelling. It typically occurs in the big toe joint. There usually is no history of an injury to an area. One goes to bed, and the attack either occurs while you're sleeping, or you first notice it when you get out of the bed in the morning. Patients describe the pain as so intense that just sheets alone touching it can cause excruciating pain. So what is it? How does it occur? Our bodies normally make uric acid when we break down purines. It's normal. Sometimes, however, we make too much uric acid, either through overproduction or under-excretion. Purines are normal in our body. Purines also can occur in some foods. If we get too much purines, our bodies can't handle the amount of uric acid it makes. The uric acid is then converted into urate crystals. Urate crystals are tiny needle-like crystals that get deposited in your joint. It typically occurs on your first attack in your big toe joint. On subsequent attacks, it can occur in any joint. Gout is a serious condition, but the good news is, through diet modification and medications, it can be well-controlled.",

        "video_sub_title": "hi everyone welcome to another video today i'm doing another hair tutorial it looks like this from the front so it looks like a really high bun which was braided into a knot but from the back it looks like that and it's basically a Dutch braid but instead of reading from the front it was braided with my head upside down and I'm going to show you how to do it and things are gonna need if if you have really frizzy hair I would recommend a sign 0 if you have kind of slippery thin hair I would recommend a styling mousse or a texturing spray to put in before so you your hair is gonna hold the braids some bobby pins a comb and some hair elastics so if you want to see how I did this look keep watching so we're gonna start that by combing all our hair very well this is my hair when I watched it and I call me the next day gets very frizzy if you have really seen here I would recommend putting some styling mousse some styling gel or even like a texturizing spray so your hair holds their brains better and then we're gonna put your head upside down and comb it through again this way all the hair is facing down and then we're gonna start our platform from here from the back of your hair we take three strands one two three and the Dutch braid is exactly like a French braid but instead of putting the braids over to other we're gonna put it under so you're gonna put the right one under like that and then the left one under select it ok now we edit from now on we will add a few more hair taking the right one add a few more hair from the side and put it back under then we're gonna take the left one add a few more hair from the side and put it back down der then we're going to hold the other two take the right one add a few more hair like that and then to put it back under the middle one and then we can take in the left one add a few more hair make sure it's like kind of as even as you can get here on the side and then you can put it back and load them into one and this is honestly easiest done when you flip your head upside down so it's like basically making a normal Dutch braid but instead of starting from the top of your head this time we starting from the back of our head and then again and it doesn't have to be to even just try to do your best and you know you're gonna feel with your fingers how how much has the right right amount of here to add kind of today top of your head here gather all your head together let the little bit in the front so to very high polity and then just secure it with an elastic you could also leave it like this but it's not the point of this hat there because you can't see the back so what I'm going to do I'm going to break the ponytail to win it just normal braid doesn't have to be too neat so it's really quickly and then I'm just gonna wrap it around the elastic and secure it with some bobby pins you can accessorize it with some headband if you want so from the front it just looks like a ballerina hairstyle but from the back it looks like that so yeah I really like this has died and i hope you found it useful and thanks so much for what",

        "video_sub_title": "like there's a finger of their pointer which way we should go that way you know we're hung up around I guess we're probably about 10,000 feet here and you know when you live at about 2800 and then make that jump to 10,000 takes a couple of days to get adjusted it'll kick your butt to start with but on this particular day it was it's not normally windy up there but on this day it was terribly windy as probably I'm guessing there were 40 mile-an-hour winds on top of this Ridge and we happen to see some elk out in this meadow and they were kind of working their way up towards this little saddle and we were able to get it from them and actually made a pretty cool stalk on them just across open ground it got pretty doggone close that's the cow that you're looking at actually you hear she's only about 40 yards and she ended up yet to within I don't know I won't say about 20 yards in it you know I never did have a clear shot that I felt comfortable with you know it looks like from this angle it looks like there's nothing in-between it but I'm actually having to look through that little white bar time to see her I just love being that close to ELQ you know it's just it's cool so we messed around with these out for a little bit and phase because up I'm gonna guess that was probably a dozen elk in one small bowl there but they eventually ended up going across that saddle and then so we went across the drainage and it's got in on some other elk we had actually heard a bull bugle and down in this draw and drop down in on him and ended up this was one of the best days of elk hunt I've ever had we got in the middle of a bunch of oh there were probably three or four different Bulls started bugling and we ended up calling in a team here running the camp huh it was a very good job at it but he's doing double duty callin and raking on trees calling in this bowl here but this little bull ended up when he finally gets the camera on it this little bullet is up coming in and actually bend down within about 50 yards of us and he stayed there for I want to guess an hour bedded down and it pretty much just had us pegged and we had to sit there while this little bull was bedded down for that long and you know normally in a situation like this where you're down in the draw the wind is going to give you away normally and you can hear with those other bolts you go in there but on this particular occasion the wind just stayed steady and it was amazing for that long that little bull never never found us out he starts to get a little bit nervous once he got up he actually came within about 10 yards everybody's super jumpy and I don't know if that was because of us or if the other bulls had him nervous or what but you'll see kind of spooks a little bit once he gets up and start coming towards us see Eagle and in his bed just sounds like a little spike giggling I've seen I've seen big bowls like 340 bowls do that same thing just kind of in their bed just you know they don't they sound like they sound like they don't have any math to them at all and they're actually big bowls laying there they just kind of not not given it their all so they can be deceptive for sure so there's a there's actually a herd off the other side of the ridge respectable you hear bugle in there but he's probably got a dozen or so cows with him and this bull is starting to head over towards them he's actually headed towards me a little bit but like I said before he gets super jumpy before he gets to my shooting Lane I never did get a shot at him you can see how he's he's not fully committed to walking he's taking a step stopping his ears or pin forward and he's nervous you can tell by his body language he something's not quite all well in his world he's probably about 15 yards from me right now but I you know it's that kind of dense brittle mahogany stuff there's no shot at all see there I can't tell if he's looking at I can't tell if he's looking at the cameraman or or what but so something he did like so when that little bull took off and ran like that I think that herd Bowl that's down below that was bugle and heard him and he actually came up but again it was he never did get into my shooting lane he was the herd bull came up to it in probably 20 yards of me and ended up I don't think it's on camera but he ended up running this this little bull off and then ducked down back down into the mahogany's with all those cows and you can see my head just come into the frame there so close so that herd bulls just kind of kind of yelling that herd bulls just kind of slowly working his way up towards us you tell he's getting a little bit louder here there [Music] gotta love that sailed help teach just goin a little deity bugles are breaking on the trees instead make that bowl think there's some there's another bowl up there and here they come lead gal there's actually a little cut a little wash that goes down that they're going to walk across so yeah look close you can see the arrow how long do we wait for him at least what we're 5 balls are bigger around us all at once just a little bit low I think looks like a good job to me zoomed in on the ball when you shot so when I shot that that bowl I had no idea how far of a shot it was you know I gap shoot and but my gap is said instinctively basically I use my arrow tip to line up my left and right and then up and down is you know just I learned that through knowing my equipment and repetition and when I stepped it off it was at 35 yards which for me and a self though that's a long shot I can make that with a modern recurve modern longbow I can drop them in you know a 4 or 5 inch circle at 35 yards all day long but with a cell phone with them exaggerated trajectory it's a much tougher shot but I felt very very confident my ability to make that shot there was no doubt in my mind I could make it and pull back and let her fly and turned out well and there's - Toby what kind of booger in my nose commemorate this it's getting cold out and so we track this bull he probably went 200 yards and got him quartered out and hung in the trees that night and vacuumed out the next day don't forget to subscribe",

about it and I'm going to share the crap out of it because if you're not using a neti pot you absolutely need to go get a neti pot right now it is that big of a deal this thing is amazing at the first sign of any kind of sinus funk you know my husband and i use it i use it on the kids it is the best thing ever I used to be a sudafed the little tiny red ones those were the only kind of would ever use and i would get sinus infections like every six months to a year and two years ago I got a wicked one sudafed was not working I had no insurance at the time I couldn't figure anything out and I found out about this neti pot I went and bought one for like less than twenty dollars and I used it and it was the best thing ever my sinus infection was cleared up in a couple of like two times two or three times using it and it was just I haven't I literally haven't even had an infection since then and that was like two two and a half years ago and I used to get them all the time so I'm going to try to do a demonstration we try to film and film and do the demonstration if I can and that is what we're going to do today because a lot of people seem to be really intimidated by this I was a little nervous at first very skeptical but it is amazing and you will not regret it let me I'm trying to make sure my kids are going to be good because they I don't want to get in the middle of this seems like they're being quiet for a second go so we might be able to get it done so I'm going to try to do this and see if I can get it working and record at the same time while I'm pouring it in my nose all right hold on one second all right whatever i'm just going to try to do with my other hand and see if I can do I should get one of the kids in here to do it alright so you make your solution up I have this little guy here I put in the stuff and I boil the water some people use distilled water I just boil water and then let it cool down and then basically i'm going to do half up one nostril and then half up the other nostril so and I don't have anything going on right now it just kind of struck me that I should you know do this and get this out there but um so it's probably going to be it should flow like right through for me because I don't have anything any kind of funk building up so let me try to get this positioned a little bit better and hopefully I can show you guys how to make this thing work I think we're in a good position know so I have everything set up got the neti pot now you do have to do we call it Nettie yoga in our house so you have to turn your head a specific way to get the flow up through your nasal whatever it is you know all that stuff and then it will come out the opposite side so we're going to start on the side it should come out this side but it does take a little bit of maneuvering to get it to actually work so we're going to try to i'm going to get it going here in a minute and try get my hair by the way and i haven't done one for like forever start to do the if you get it down the walls there it goes okay so you just poured it and it will come out the other side so ties it like starts to kind of feel like you're drowning a little bit if you do it the wrong way so that's what it did when I first started so I haven't done this in forever but it just pours straight out you can see it coming out so you just let it out throw about halfway and i have my right kind of a beer so i could see and it just pours right out when you are clogged it obviously pop up okay when your club you know I definitely got a half out when your clogged did got to go through it's going to take a little bit longer it's still running through you're going to want to have lots of tissue or something that's how something around you to blow because you can see the waters of pouring like i said i don't have anything at all going on right now and I haven't in like 22 years or longer since i started using this so it's just going to continue to pour out for me but what i would do is blow my nose at this point and then i'm going to switch and do the other side and then again you just get it position in the nostril that you want the size you're doing I said you're going to tilt up and you'll feel it there you go and I don't know hopefully you guys could see this buddy is poor and it goes straight if you start feeling it go down your throat or anything just pilcher for hunt for words and there you go it will stop and like I said there's absolutely nothing I got a vital right now so it's just literally a straight stream you pour it all through the daddies completely done and then I'm going to blow my nose to get all of that cleaned out and I will be right back okay so yeah I mean it's as simple as that's all you have to do do it twice a day if I if we start feeling stuff coming on I don't I like I said I haven't even that's the first time in like two two and a half years I've use this thing but my husband uses it how early than I do because you know he's out working and out with other people and stuff so he gets a lot more funk started than I do but um had to sign the first sign of anything had congestion up here any kind of nasal congestion anything the first sign of it he will do that he's like can you make me a neti pot so I make him one in the morning he does it and everything's completely gone and nothing ever even comes of it so it's very very good a very effective a natural way to just completely clean you out and like if you have allergies and stuff and you know it helps with that we don't use it for that but I've heard that you can use it for that and one of the higher three-year-old does have he gets some kind of seasonal funk going sometimes but um we I can't get him to use it yet but if I could then that would help his allergies as well so hopefully that will help you guys go get yourselves a neti pot it's amazing you will love it and it will be the only thing you need to do you don't need to buy sudafed you don't need to buy all the pharmaceuticals you'll need to buy all that garbage just go by and Eddie hot and clean it out and then you'll be totally fine thanks for watching guys

        "video_sub_title": "[Music] [Applause] okay guys so in this video we're going to learn how to sit in the middle so the first thing is when it is this no water it is very important that it's distilled water and not sink water because sink water has minerals in chlorine that will miss your cigar so second thing is a sponge and a container for the water so let's go ahead and take everything out of the humidor remember to be very careful taking everything out and now that we have taken everything out let's go ahead and pour water to the glass container try not to put too much water so you won't make a man so let's go ahead and let's wet our sponge remember not to make the sponge too way that is stripping too much water inside the humidor if the imager is too way try to wipe it off slowly with a clean cloth if not it will eventually build the mole and we don't want that so let's go ahead and a squeeze a pretty good now that we are ready to wipe inside of the humidor remember to wipe every corner and all the pieces that we took out also so here's the question of what is in a humidor that's one of the most important questions that I get a lot if you don't season it that we will actually Rob moisture from the cigars and dry them out fast beginners that don't know a lot about cigars will do this and they will purchase their first humidor in that season and I actually made the damn mistake myself and that's because I didn't know anything about cigars back then my wife bought my first humidor maybe like three years ago when a Christmas and me excited a sale we went to the cigar shop well maybe like 15 cigars went home and put them in so many humidor about a week or so or by started noticing then I feel my cigars were going bad most of them were dry and falling apart I got really upset and started asking myself of is there something wrong with my image or is it fake wood or were my cigars bad when the bottom so I talked to a field my friends who own cigars of their own asked him about my cigar problem and while they're drying going back so fast and they said well maybe the humidity and temperature and I ride maybe and more water or beads season the humidor again at that point I was like you know what uh I think I should do a little more research about cigars in Miami door so I went home started doing my research started knowing more about about the care the humidor and the first thing that you need to do when buying one and that was seasoning so that the seasoning in the door and uh after that although most regards were perfect fun so remember Gus the humidity inside a humidor is very important it is important to maintain your humidor below the maximum temperature of 73 degrees her 23 Celsius in between 65 to 74 percent humidity the best conditions or 70 degrees in 70% humidity I personally recommend having a digital kilometer and durometer to better control of the humidity and temperature of the humidor make sure that you check the humidity level at least every two weeks to ensure that the humidity does not vary if you trusted 65% and should add more peachy solution or distilled water into the humidifier storage timid or in a cool dry place to prevent mold growth avoid placing the humidor in direct sunlight is very important if the temperature and humidity gets to have cigars can debilitate potentially damaging fungus or mold or everyone's nightmare the damn tobacco beetle I will be talking more about the tobacco beetle and the temperature of the humidors on my next video you it will be a very important video so stay tuned guys but anyways after don't wipe in the whole humidor or need to place the sponge inside the plastic bag like I just did a few seconds ago and leave it for 24 hours after that it should be ready to go a lot of people usually do it again and leave it for another 24 hours so just to make sure it works perfectly if you want to you can do that I only did my once and it worked perfectly after just 24 hours so okay guys don't forget to give this video a thumbs up if you have any more questions about it about sitting in your humidor just add me on my instagram at wall 1096 send me a direct message and i'll try to help you as much as I can thank you guys for hanging up and I say [Music]",

        "video_sub_title": "what's up guys hey Jared Beck's Tran here doctor of physical therapy tone and tighten calm and this is how to stretch out your tight calves [Music] all right guys thank you so much for joining me today here I'm tonin Titan I'm excited to be able to help you out of this problem show you some stretches that are hopefully going to help you guys to feel better if the things that I do share beneficial to you be sure to hit that thumbs up button okay so a calf tightness common problem that I see a lot in runners I'm kind of the otherwise active patient population those who stand a lot can experience this those who have had an injury in the past hip knee ankle injuries can predispose you to some of this calf tightness that we're going to be talking about the problem that I see with this is that it can develop into bigger problems down the road including achilles tendonitis and even some plantar fasciitis and so let me show you a few stretches to help you to get rid of some of that calf tightness before I do that if you're new to tone and tighten thanks so much for joining me today if you haven't done so already be sure to subscribe to our channel so you never miss a new video from us you can do that there's a red button down below there's also a little red button right down there subscribe to our Channel now let's get into these calf stretches the first thing we're gonna want to do is actually reach for our foam roller so with that calf tightness you can actually develop what we'd refer to as fascial adhesions you've probably heard of fashio before it's a it's a thin covering for each one of our muscles and what can happen with range of motion limitations is that fasciae can restrict the movement in the muscle so it's important that the first thing we do is release some of those fascial adhesions in order to maximize our stretching in order to make our stretching more effective we're gonna do that with a foam roller if you DEP if you don't have a foam roller check the link in the description to this video it'll link right to this one's probably my favorite one the one that I recommend the most often so to foam roll your calves and the easiest way to do it is to sit just like I'm seated here you're gonna use your hands and requires a little bit of some upper-body strength to do it pop up onto the hands and then you're just gonna roll back and forth on that foam roller if that feels okay if you need something a little bit more what I would do is cross my legs now I've got all of my weight just on that left leg as I roll that back and forth all of a sudden that becomes a lot more intense because there's a lot more pressure on my left leg what I typically do in my clinic is I'll set a two-minute timer have patients start on a phone for about two minutes you can do that once a day next is going to be a seated calf stretch probably one of my personal favorites just because what I find is that a lot of times with calf tightness that kind of carries over up into the hamstrings as well it's rare to find someone who has teiecast it doesn't have tight hamstrings and so if I can throw a stretch at you that's going to address the tightness in each one of those areas bonus right and so this seated calf stretch what you'll do I've got this treatment table I tell people at home go to a bed or your kitchen table are kind of the two best places to do this couch is just a little bit too low it's kind of hard to get into the right position you're gonna take a belt or a towel or a sheet or a rope I've got this stretch out strap that works really nice and then so I'm gonna stretch my right leg out my right legs out straight I'm gonna put that around the ball of my right foot and now what I do is I pull that towards me a pretty good calf stretch right there but the real moneymaker with this the part that I want you to emphasize is straightening your back out if you if you sit up nice and straight I don't want you to round forward like this if you sit up nice and straight while you do this all of a sudden now I get that in my calf but that's also right behind my knee and that's also up in my hamstring so a good stretch here so I'm pulling here I'm gonna sit up straight and then I'm going to lean my shoulders towards my toes and it's not a very big motion you'll see that's as far as you can go but that really is going to accentuate that stretch it's gonna put it again your calf the back of your knee and up into your hamstring you'll do that for 20 seconds you'll repeat that three times and you can do that once or twice a day the next two stretches I want to show you are going to be done in standing this is going to be kind of your classic runners stretch or if I told you to stretch your calves out a lot of times people know this one what they don't know is a variation on it that I want to show you right now so the the runners stretch if I'm going to stretch this left leg out this would be I'm going to come up to a wall and I'll have a wall right here but I pretend like I'm pushing on a wall right now that left heel is glued down to the ground hands go against the wall and then as you been Legg you kind of push your hips into the wall to introduce more of a stretch into that left leg knee is locked out and that's going to get a good stretch into that calf now here's what people don't always get your calf is actually two muscles one of those muscles the more superficial one the one that kind of sits on top crosses your knee joint with my knee locked out as I push on that wall and as I push my hips towards the wall I'm gonna get a pretty good stretch I feel that in the top of my calf and even the back part of my knee we're stretching that more superficial muscle if you want to maximize your time maximize your outcomes we need to get that bottom or that deeper muscle as well what you'll do is you'll get into that same stretch position pushing on a wall knees straight but then all you do is just unlock your knee you'll see all that I mean it's not a very big movement I went from me straight to me unlocked as I'm pushing on that wall as I perform that stretch all of a sudden I feel that way down low almost in my Achilles tendon that tells me that I'm pushing in the right direction that I'm stretching in the right spot all right you guys so just two more stretches for you we're going to take those same principles that we just learned and apply them in a little bit different way and if you've got a stair available I like this on a stair or like I said in the beginning a lot of times runners will have tightness in their calves if there's like a curb available this is a great stretch that you can do there we're just going to do a kind of passive calf stretch up one stair you're gonna stand up onto the stair and then let your heels drop below your toes now I feel a pretty good stretch there that's in both of my calves if you want to take that even further what you can do is buy us one side so now my left legs up on top of the stair but my right leg is down off of this stair and then so my right leg straight toes are on the stair heel is below my toes and then I can just hang out right there like that with my left leg I can take weight off or I can put weight on to my right leg depending on how much stretch on tumbler towards how much stretch I can do and so that's a great way to stretch out that gastrocnemius muscle my legs great that's the muscle that we're stretching out but now we know that there's two muscles we've got to stretch them both and so if I just unlock that knee a little bit and then that same principle if I just put more weight on to that left leg I fill that one down a lot lower on my on my leg it's down kind of more lower calf Achilles tendon with my knee straight it's up high and behind my knee unlock it and now Olsen I get more of a stretch down low in that Achilles tendon area so three times 20-second holds on each one of those so three times 20 seconds with your knee straight three times 20 seconds with your knee bent and there you guys have them so those are about six of my favorite calf stretches that you can do to just alleviate some of that tension some of that pain some that tightness that you might feel in your calf it's a great way to prevent further injury if you guys appreciated this video if you benefited from this I hope that some of this helps you guys out do me a favor hit that thumbs up button down below if you guys have any questions or comments about this

        "video_title": "Eating Healthy on a Budget",
        "video_sub_title": "and today's food was medicine how to stay healthy and do it on a budget i think it's really hard for people to understand if we want to make really healthy recipes that we can do it for cheap normally people think of the dollar menu when you think about saving money or doing something cheap but you're going to break it down for us so hi how's it going first of all it's going really good really good i'm excited that we're doing this segment because this is a big question i get all the time from clients is how do i make this work and it's so expensive i'm spending more on food but it doesn't have to be that hard really so we have some examples of things that you can buy that are already made in the store and then things that you can make on your own so let's go ahead and start over here with the pasta sauces yes you can save a ton of money on sauces if you make your own on our website too we have all these different recipes and as an italian girl you should try my pasta sauce for sure so with this pasta sauce right here if you were to make your own obviously you add your own olive oil and spices that you have at home it's half the price of the canned stuff or the jarred stuff so you can make your own sauce for four dollars or you could buy it for eight it really comes down to convenience i love budgeting time on sundays three or four hours to prep meals for the week if you start to plan ahead then you kind of get in the groove and it starts to happen that's a great idea and then another point too that you want to make talking about the bulk section and that saves but also can you talk to people who are living as one or two and how that can kind of work for you as well yeah thank you for pointing that out okay so in the bulk section if you shop in there and you get really comfortable shopping in there you're gonna save 50 because you're not paying for packaging you're not paying for marketing it's better for the environment and all of that and so buying just what you need especially if you're just cooking for one or two but you know with the whole journey it's all about making it practically work in your life and so if you're going to make a pot of rice for dinner and a stir fry make extra and then the next morning put some coconut milk in it put some pumpkin seeds in it and then that will be breakfast the next day in three or four minutes oh coconut oil so you want to just start to think when you're planning meals that you're gonna how are you going to reuse it how are you going to make extra that's a key getting creative now this one is a great example because i right now i'm crazy about kale chips but if you get them from the store they're like six to ten dollars for the bag and it's a little ridiculous so can you talk to us about how you made homemade kale chips absolutely yeah you could go broke on kale chips so i made homemade kale chips for two dollars these cost six dollars like you said in the store and they were on sale super super simple so all you do is you wash the kale you de-stem it i tossed it with a little grape seed oil salt little pepper and then you bake it 375 for 10 to 11 minutes eat a kale chip the only the hard part about trying kale chips is they get stuck in your teeth yeah so you really can't do that i'll have to send you off yes for sure um farmer's markets how can we cut costs at the farmer's market well you're kind of cutting out the middleman of all the expenses of the grocery store if you can shop at your local farmers market so produce should be about 15 to 20 percent cheaper if you can kind of get in a habit and go to the market it's fun to be connected to your food anyway and to know the farmers and know where things come from but here's the catch whether you go to the grocery store or you go to farmers market you have to budget 20 minutes to do something with your produce when you get home because how many of us we're busy we put it in there it's time to cook you don't want to wash it you don't want to do anything with it sure it goes bad and then we have to rebuy it the next week right so if you can budget 20 minutes and you can just rinse off your greens wash them put them in a container with a piece of paper towel then they'll last a lot longer if you put that paper towel in there okay and that way if you're making eggs in the morning great you just throw some kale in there really super fast super simple or if you're having a burrito at lunch you can stuff it in because it's already planned it's already prepared all right well one more before we go it says use meat as a condiment and not the centerpiece of your meal i know meats and fish and those things that we put at the center of our plate can always be super expensive so is that kind of a recommendation that you're coming up with today it is i think that i always talk about clean meats all the time hormone and antibiotic-free those are important and they're more expensive so using a little less as a flavoring or as a condiment you know having two or three ounces instead of six or seven ounces you'll still get plenty of protein and then you can bulk up on all these other great things all right i love it thank you so much krista and also you can get in touch with her at her whole journey it's a practice is located in encinitas and visit her blog we've linked that to our website fox 5",

        "video_sub_title": "the following is my ey I for killing fleas and I use this same mixture that I'm going to provide the ingredients for in my garden as well that's where I discovered it its effectiveness so when I was spraying my zucchini leaves with this mixture to get rid of the mold on them and then I noticed that the leaves were just brilliant and bright and green and the ones I had to pull out the new ones just came back bright green and it worked very effectively also while I was outside spraying the garden I noticed that it was also killing the other pests like ants for example it was not killing very like beneficial bugs so I was sitting still in my garden and waiting to hear an answer for getting rid of the fleas on the carpeting cuz they're just all over in one specific room especially so I thought came to spray the carpeting with the mixture and it worked right away immediately as soon as I sprayed it it's non-toxic the dogs lick it I don't on them because they can lick it actually off and and it's very effective so what I do is I mix equal parts apple cider vinegar with grape seed oil in a spray bottle and then I dilute the rest of that bottle with water so my spray bottle is pretty large so I used about 4 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar and this is approximate and approximately the same equivalent with grape seed oil and the rest you want to dilute it and the apple cider vinegar is really what really kills them and the grape seed oil is what holds what allows the apple cider vinegar to stick with this the fleece stick on it and you want to use the spray bottle that can mist it because obviously fleas are very small so you want to be able to cover a lot of territory and make sure you get them so just spray it on missed all over the carpeting and then you'll just do if you notice em like a day or two later which I haven't noticed at all been effective just notice it more net and then I will just come back over it or if you if they laid or hatched an egg or something you don't where you just go back over it again and and it kills them right away so it's non-toxic I washed my dogs with apple cider vinegar and I spray the objects like a material object with this particular mixture I find that just washing the dogs and apple cider vinegar definitely does kill the fleas and this mixture will kill them on the surface so it kind of defeating to kill them on the dog and then they get on the carpeting and then you know you have the problem all over again so I hope it helps and please leave your comments in the description box below if it was effective with you and I hope to provide more of these tips in the future Thanks and remember to shake the bottle as you spray so that the mixture stays together like mixed together so until next time peace",

        "video_title": "Setup and Review: Coleman Sundome 4-Person Tent",
        "video_sub_title": "Can it really fit 4 people? Let's find out...queue in the music!  \"The Coleman Sundome 4-person tent\". This highly-rated tent by Coleman measures in at 9 feet wide by 7 feet deep with a ceiling height of just under 5 feet. It comes with a detachable rainfly, 3 poles and 10 stakes for securing things down. Everything is stored in this handy dandy carrying case and as far as price, I purchased this from Amazon for $60 as of February 2016. All right, let's unbox and lay everything out. Oh look, instructions...and it says \"Enlist the help of at least one other person to assist you when it is time to assemble the tent\". Hahaha...nonsense. I will do this by myself Mr Instructions. Anyway, here we have the tent, the rainfly, poles, stakes and a welcome mat (that comes with the tent by the way). Make sure you lay the tent down on a flat surface with the door facing in the desired direction. We start off by assembling the poles, as you can see they are held together by elastic bands (pretty cool). Just pull a section straight out then fit it together going down the line until the entire pole is assembled. Next, push one pole through one of the sleeves on the top of the tent then do the same for the other side. On each corner of the tent, there are pins that the poles will slide into. Start off with one side of one pole, then to the other side, then do the same on the last pole. As you do this, make sure to stretch the sleeves on top so that they don't get bunched up. The tent finally takes shape by snapping a total of 8 hooks to the poles (2 per corner). For the rainfly, flip it upside down then slide one end of the pole into its pocket. Secure it with the attached velcro tab then repeat the procedure on the other side. Next, drape it over the top of the tent with the pole facing front to back. Secure it down by hooking all 4 corners to a metal ring on all corners of the tent. That's it! Now, let's talk about features. Wait...did you say ventilation? Why yes, this tent has mesh panels all over. The top half of the left and right side walls are open mesh while the front and rear can be opened by unzipping the solid panel (ohai!). There is also an open mesh section at the bottom of the back wall protected by a rain flap on the outside. Might be a good idea to sleep near this panel if you are sharing this tent with someone who just had a huge burrito for dinner (I'm just sayin'). As for other features, on both the left and right walls are convenient pockets for storing your small belongings and if you need to hang things like a shoe or a lantern, there is a ring on the ceiling for just that. There are other nice conveniences such as loops for securing the front and rear panels plus a small zippered opening for inserting things like an extension cord, cell phone, a pocket knife or a baby carrot. So, now the big question...can it fit 4 people? Well, let's see, if I clone myself and lay on the floor...you can see that 4 of us can fit, but it'll will be a tight squeeze especially when you factor in sleeping bags and other gear. I'm 5'10\" and 180lbs by the way. I'd say this is a 2-3 person tent with sufficient room for equipment. To break it down, unhook the rainfly from each corner then slip out the poles from the pins. Now, don't do like what I did here and try to pull the poles out from the start...be sure to push it out first as far as you can, then pull it out the rest of the way otherwise the pole will snag on the sleeves. Lastly, dissasemble the poles, roll up the tent and the rainfly then try and smash everything back into the carrying case. Be careful when closing the bag. You don't want the zipper to pinch and tear the tent or  the rainfly. All in all this is a good tent. It's too heavy for backpacking and during the cold winter months, the copius amount of ventilation might be a bad thing. I have also read some reviews online stating that this tent does hold up to heavy rains. There are some reviewers who say the opposite, that it holds up just fine. In any case, I would recommend treating the tent with seam sealer that you can purchase online or find at your local sporting goods store and that should take care of any issues with rain.  \"I'm happy in this tent because I don't have to pay the rent\"",

        "video_sub_title": "today i'm gonna give you a permanent solution from\u00a0 which you can get ride of your fungal infections\u00a0\u00a0 such as candidates or ring worm from its root\u00a0 cause everyone this is argham since the soviet\u00a0\u00a0 and you're watching disease media so if you\u00a0 are suffering from fungal infection then you\u00a0\u00a0 had tried lots of home remedies such as turmeric\u00a0 paste neem juice aloe vera gel or the garlic or\u00a0\u00a0 ginger paste but i think none of them properly\u00a0 work with you even that you had purchased lots\u00a0\u00a0 of fungicidal creams or the lotions from the\u00a0 market but they also works for a few days and then\u00a0\u00a0 they stop working so there are lots of questions\u00a0 which are coming in your mind that is there any\u00a0\u00a0 home remedy which can work on it is there any\u00a0 anti-fungal drug or any ointment cream which\u00a0\u00a0 can work better than it or how i can get ride of\u00a0 it permanently so now all the questions are going\u00a0\u00a0 to cover in this video but before that i just want\u00a0 to introduce the fungal infection in front of you\u00a0\u00a0 a small introduction so that you can understand\u00a0 what is fungal infection and how it's going to be\u00a0\u00a0 treated for example the fungal infection of\u00a0 our toes is known as athlete food there are\u00a0\u00a0 different different names of the scalp fungal\u00a0 infection the skin fungal infection the groin\u00a0\u00a0 area fungal infection the names are according\u00a0 to the location of the body part that where\u00a0\u00a0 is the fungal infection but the same thing is\u00a0 that you need a anti-fungal treatment for that\u00a0\u00a0 you need an anti-fungal drug to treat the fungal\u00a0 infection okay now let's clear the doubt regarding\u00a0\u00a0 the home remedies and the tubes or the anti-fungal\u00a0 creams which we are purchasing from the market\u00a0\u00a0 the first doubt is about home remedies that\u00a0 is can home remedies work if yes then how and\u00a0\u00a0 if not then why not the answer to this question\u00a0 is that home remedies are used from the ancient\u00a0\u00a0 times that people use and they recover by using\u00a0 them but today the situation is different there\u00a0\u00a0 are lots of resistance strains which are coming\u00a0 today there are stronger fungal infections there\u00a0\u00a0 are stronger pathogens which are coming today but\u00a0 previously there are not so much of resistance\u00a0\u00a0 stains and home remedies can easily work on it\u00a0 because home remedies can work very slow and\u00a0\u00a0 there is a time consuming process and that's\u00a0 why the home remedies which we are applying\u00a0\u00a0 seems to be a very less effective or not working\u00a0 because they works very very slow and the fungal\u00a0\u00a0 infection just increasing in multiples in a\u00a0 very short period of time so for the fast and\u00a0\u00a0 effective treatment of fungal infection we need\u00a0 anti fungal or the ointment creams so now relating\u00a0\u00a0 from it one more question arose is that if we are\u00a0 purchasing anti-fungal creams from the market but\u00a0\u00a0 they stopped working after a few days now what is\u00a0 the reason behind it there are two reasons behind\u00a0\u00a0 it the first one that you are not purchasing a\u00a0 right kind of cream you are purchasing a cream\u00a0\u00a0 which contains steroids steroids are the chemical\u00a0 which when applied to the part of skin which is\u00a0\u00a0 infected with the fungal infection gives the quick\u00a0 relief but temporary relief if the use of steroids\u00a0\u00a0 is skipped just a single day the fungal infection\u00a0 can spread in multiples because the steroid cream\u00a0\u00a0 when applied to a particular area of skin or the\u00a0 part of the body then they decrease the immunity\u00a0\u00a0 of that part of the skin the fungal infection\u00a0 can grow in multiple because the skin which\u00a0\u00a0 is fighting against that fungal infection does\u00a0 not have enough immunity to fight now with that\u00a0\u00a0 fungal infection and that fungal infection\u00a0 will grow on and on and the second reason is\u00a0\u00a0 again the resistance problem for example if you\u00a0 are using a certain kind of anti-fungal cream\u00a0\u00a0 then what happens the fungal become resistance to\u00a0 that anti-fungal cream means that the anti-fungal\u00a0\u00a0 cream can't affect that fungal because the\u00a0 fungal has developed a resistance inside it\u00a0\u00a0 that it can't be killed with that particular\u00a0 fungicidal agent so you just have to replace\u00a0\u00a0 that fungicidal agent so that the fungal can be\u00a0 killed so now again there are lots of questions\u00a0\u00a0 which are using in your head that which fungicidal\u00a0 agent is good which we have to purchase and which\u00a0\u00a0 can able to treat the disease from its root cause\u00a0 so now listen it carefully you can purchase any\u00a0\u00a0 of the fungicidal agent from the market all are\u00a0 good but make sure the steroid should not to be\u00a0\u00a0 contained in any of them means that for being at\u00a0 the safer side you don't have to purchase any of\u00a0\u00a0 the anti-fungal cream or anti-fungal lotion with\u00a0 any additional chemical with it maybe a chemical\u00a0\u00a0 can be steroid all chemicals compounds are not\u00a0 the steroids but for your safe side no additional\u00a0\u00a0 chemicals should to be there with that anti-fungal\u00a0 cream or lotion and one more important thing there\u00a0\u00a0 are three very very effective anti-fungal drugs\u00a0 which you can purchase from the market most of the\u00a0\u00a0 doctor recommended all of that are good but the\u00a0 three one are the best one you can purchase any\u00a0\u00a0 of the one from these three one especially the\u00a0 luliconazole this is the best anti-fungal drug\u00a0\u00a0 which can treat the fungal infection from its root\u00a0 cause some mild side effects are seen during the\u00a0\u00a0 beginning of the day such as redness of skin or\u00a0 some pimples small small pimples at that area\u00a0\u00a0 but that's okay that's a side effect but they\u00a0 will also resolve after a few days when the\u00a0\u00a0 treatment is just going to complete but if you\u00a0 think that your fungal infection has spread in\u00a0\u00a0 a large portion of your body part then don't\u00a0 wait please consult a dermatologist because in\u00a0\u00a0 this case you also need oral medications with\u00a0 the anti-fungal creams and still now if you are\u00a0\u00a0 thinking that home remedies can better work on\u00a0 you then please clear this misconception because\u00a0\u00a0 home remedies works very slow and even that some\u00a0 home remedies can't work properly because of the\u00a0\u00a0 resistance problem but there is one thing that\u00a0 can work very effectively that is your immunity\u00a0\u00a0 if you increase your immunity then there\u00a0 is less chances to get a fungal infection\u00a0\u00a0 and if there is fungal infection then it can be\u00a0 treated very easily at a short period of time\u00a0\u00a0 so now for immunity you require five important\u00a0 points to cover up the first point is the\u00a0\u00a0 clear constipation means that you don't have a\u00a0 constipation situation or a constipation problem\u00a0\u00a0 and four more things i had discussed in the\u00a0 special video on immunity i had linked that\u00a0\u00a0 video on the i button and also in the description\u00a0 you can go through there and watch the video to\u00a0\u00a0 increase your immunity so that's what how you\u00a0 can treat your fungal infection effectively\u00a0\u00a0 if you like this video then give it a thumbs\u00a0 up please share this video with your family and\u00a0\u00a0 friends because by sharing this video you are\u00a0 creating awareness about fungal

Once applied, let it dry if a little mascara has fallen on the lower part, and clean with a cotton swab. This is one  very useful tool to make small corrections next we apply a little bit of illuminator with a tone C  rado and cheekbones another one and she had fantastic cheekbones on the tip of her nose as well and a little bit of blush is a pinkish blush with a coral undertone and now one of the most important parts of this makeup which is to recreate audrey's eyebrows that were quite thick, although in this film it was less thick than in previous films, which were very thick, we are going to build them slowly by making little touches first with a shadow and then we will apply a long-lasting eyebrow gel and little by little we are building until we invite the maximum  audrey's eyebrows this type of eyebrow brush if you don't have it or don't want to buy it you can do it in a very simple way you take a mascara that already works for us and clean it well jce disinfects it and once it's dry you can do it  use as an eyebrow brush now we apply the make a forever gel that is long lasting and waterproof to give more drama to the eyebrows s and lastly we are on the lips applying a coral pencil first and then we will apply a coral lipstick just as she wore audrey during almost the entire film we widen the lip a little with the pencil and apply a coral lipstick we apply it little by little  in several layers to make it last much longer and here we have the final result I hope you liked it",

        "video_sub_title": "syndrome called the true sciatica are they the same or different setec amines pain radiating along the course of the sciatic nerve which runs from the lower back to the buttock and the back of the thigh and into the lower leg and the foot usually effect one side of the body and usually call it lumber radiculopathy the largest number of tzedakah or cares from disk herniation so Attica is not a diagnosis it is a symptom of underlying condition for example in performace syndrome it can have sciatica due to performance muscle pushing on the nerve so in this case we'll call the condition piriformis syndrome the diagnosis is by reformers syndrome but if the sciatica which is a symptom comes from genetic desk then we'll call it herniated disk and we call the condition of the sciatica lumber radiculopathy so this explain the condition and some details piriformis syndrome is a condition that has Sadek nerve symptoms due to compression of the sciatic nerve around the buttock and the help this condition is usually connected to the piriformis muscle and its relationship to the sciatic nerve a muscle runs from the sacrum to the hem and it is in close proximity to the certain nerve the nerve exit below and the nerve is interior to it what causes the piriformis syndrome anatomic anomalies such as a split performace or vascular structures or variation of the certain nerve death also the syndrome can cause by tightness or despair of the piriformis muscle that will squeeze the certain nerve usually from overuse problems such as in bicycling that pressure on the nerve will cause swelling and inflammation about the clinical diagnosis will have pain in the posterior gluteal region and the body shooting down the back of the leg in the bath of the sciatic nerve causes symptom like sciatica with burning tingling and shooting pain he can use some provocative tests such as the fair test flexion abduction and internal rotation of the head will produce the sentence due to tension of the piriformis muscle or the lasso test in which the straight leg raising pain is aggravated by forced ankle dorsiflexion our former syndrome needs to be differentiated from sciatica both could have the same symptoms but both have different causes the diagnosis should be done by a seclusion of a spine problem that compresses on the spinal nerve root and causes sciatica the main cause of the - sciatica is a disc herniation so in the patient complains of sciatica the doctor need to ask themselves a question it this that occur due to compression on the setting nerve itself or is it due to compression on the nerve roots of the Sadek nerves so you'll get an MRI rule out the spine as a cause of compression on the nerve roots of the sciatic nerve and if the patient does not have a neat disc then the patient will probably have a pair of forma syndrome eat meat or piriformis syndrome first he start with conservative treatment with anti-inflammatory medication physiotherapy and the stretching of the piriformis injection he can do the injection under ultrasound or under fluoroscopy make sure the patient would have somebody to drive them because the serener may get numb and they may not be able to drive and surgery is the last resort you will do release of the piriformis muscle you would do sciatic nerve your license you will do that as the last resort and after exclude the spine condition and after you have a positive test from injection of the piriformis means division have to say I felt better after the injection piriformis syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion thank you I hope that was helpful you",

        "video_title": "Risk Factors for Heart Disease: Cholesterol",
        "video_sub_title": "Cholesterol is a fat that travels through the blood; 85% of your cholesterol is produced by your liver and the rest comes from the food you eat. Cholesterol plays some important roles in our bodies such as producing hormones and vitamin D, to name a few. When cholesterol is combined with a protein it forms what is called a lipoprotein. There are 2 main types of lipoproteins in your blood. Low density lipoproteins (LDL), also called \"bad\" cholesterol, can cause plaque buildup on the walls of our arteries. Too much LDL can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. High density lipoproteins (HDL), also called \"good\" cholesterol, help the body get rid of the bad cholesterol. Too little of HDL can increase your risk of cardiovascular disease. We also have Triglycerides, a type of fat, rather than cholesterol, which is found in the blood. High levels of triglycerides are associated with excess weight, excess alcohol or sugar intake, diabetes or genetics. Important fact! In Canada, cholesterol is measured in milimoles per liter and in the US, it's measured in milligrams per deciliters instead! What are the health risks of high cholesterol? It can block any artery in your body and limit blood flow to your heart muscle. This can cause chest pain, also called angina, and lead to a heart attack. Have your cholesterol checked if you are: A man over 40, or a woman over 50, or anyone who is a smoker, has diabetes, has high blood pressure, or is overweight, has a family history of early heart disease, stroke or high cholesterol, is experiencing erectile dysfunction, chronic kidney disease, inflammatory disease, HIV infection, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Determining if your cholesterol is too high depends on many factors. Your doctor will use a special formula to calculate your personal risk level by taking many things into consideration, such as your: age, gender, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, if you're a smoker, if you have diabetes, your blood pressure. Once your risk is determined, your doctor will decide if your cholesterol needs to be reduced. Your lifestyle and eating habits may have a significant impact on your cholesterol. You can start today by: quitting smoking, eating well by: choosing 7-8 servings of vegetables and fruits daily, choosing whole grains, eating foods high in soluble fiber, like oatmeal and barley which may help to lower your LDL cholesterol. Choosing more plant based protein like beans, nuts and seeds. Limit red meat to once or twice/week. Eat fish at least twice/week. Limit alcohol. And lastly, exercise. Regular exercise, such a brisk walking 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week may help raise your good cholesterol. It is possible that despite these changes, your cholesterol remains high. If that's the case, your doctor may prescribe a medication. The most common type of medication used to lower high cholesterol is called a Statin. Statins have been around for a few decades and can safely reduce your risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Speak to your doctor or pharmacist about any concerns you might have about statins.

        "video_title": "Chronic Inflammation (Symptoms and Signs) + How to Reduce Inflammation",
        "video_sub_title": "in today's video we're going to be talking about chronic inflammation and seven signs to watch out for chronic inflammation is when inflammation occurs for a prolonged period of time and it can happen in different areas throughout the body chronic inflammation is the root cause of almost all modern day diseases including diabetes heart disease arthritis and autoimmune conditions so it is not something to take lightly in 2014 it was estimated that over half of americans had at least one disease relating to chronic inflammation with most of these people having more than one chronic inflammation has become an epidemic but one that we have normalized we chalk up these symptoms to just what happens as we age but just because these diseases are common does not mean that they are normal type 2 diabetes used to be called adult onset diabetes because it was only seen in adults now that it has become more common in children it has been relabeled as type 2 diabetes and this is just one example of how these diseases are not a product of aging but rather our lifestyle but here's the good news there are steps you can take to reverse chronic inflammation and the associated disease risk in today's video we're gonna go through seven signs of chronic inflammation and what you can do to improve symptoms hey guys welcome back to my channel if you're new here my name is kait i'm a health coach and i post videos on a high fat nutrient dense way of eating if you like this video please give it a thumbs up feel free to share and make sure to subscribe and make sure to follow me on instagram twitter and facebook where's your new posts every single day the topic of today is chronic inflammation so let's start off by talking about what inflammation is because it isn't always a bad thing acute versus chronic inflammation inflammation is a part of the body's defense mechanism it is the process in which the body recognizes something is trying to harm it and works to fight it off and heal your tissue inflammation can be triggered by an injury an infection or a toxin now acute inflammation is a good thing think of when you roll your ankle the area will become red swollen and stiff which is the inflammatory response in action as the injury heals the inflammation goes down chronic inflammation happens when this response lingers and your body is left in a state of high alert and high stress and this is when inflammation can start to lead to problems and disease but how can you know if you suffer from chronic inflammation as i said at the start a lot of people who have chronic inflammatory diseases have more than one so these symptoms can manifest in different ways throughout the body so let's get into the seven signs of chronic inflammation and make sure you stick around until the end because number seven might surprise you number one low energy if you are always tired and low in energy despite getting a good night's sleep this can be a sign of chronic inflammation fatigue is a common symptom of a lot of inflammatory diseases low-grade inflammation can lead to an imbalance of energy availability and expenditure it increases the requirement of cellular energy to ensure rapid regeneration of immune cells and further depletes you of the fuel you need to feel energized number two joint and muscle pain now of course if you experience acute joint and muscle pain this is totally normal if you do a hard workout your muscles should be sore afterwards as they break down and rebuild and that isn't a bad thing but if your joints or muscles are sore day in and day out that's a bad sign inflammatory arthritis includes conditions characterized by pain swelling tenderness and warmth in the joints as well as morning stiffness that lasts for more than an hour the immune system is mistakenly releasing inflammatory chemicals despite there being no need to the resulting inflammation attacks joint tissues and can lead to pain swelling and muscle loss number three brain fog this is another very common symptom that accompanies inflammatory diseases a study published at the end of 2019 found that inflammation appears to have a specific negative effect on the brain's readiness to reach and maintain an alert state participants of the study were injected with vaccine known to cause temporary inflammation and were then given a cognitive test when the same participants were injected with only water for placebo they performed better on the same test the study concluded these novel findings suggest that acute inflammation requires individuals to exert greater cognitive effort when preparing for a task in order to maintain adequate behavioral performance so if you are experiencing brain fog and can't figure out why it could be a sign of chronic inflammation number four digestive problems symptoms of poor digestion including bloating diarrhea and constipation can be another sign of chronic inflammation an imbalance in gut bacteria can cause an inflammatory response and lead to these symptoms inflammatory bowel disease or ibd is the name used to describe inflammation disorders of the digestive tract once again the body is creating an inflammatory response to a problem that doesn't exist number five frequent infections if you always seem to be getting sick this can be another sign that you are chronically inflamed too much inflammation can lead to your immune system becoming weak which can cause you to get sick more often when you're chronically inflamed your immune system is working non-stop for months if not years so it's understandable how this can lead to impaired function number six allergies this is another example of chronic inflammation that you might not have expected but once again it comes back to a weakened immune system the symptoms of allergies like red itchy eyes a running nose and the swelling of our airways all come from inflammation caused by chemicals that we release from our own cells in a misguided attempt to protect ourselves and finally we have depression and anxiety there is a link between depression and an increased immune activation with many chronic disease sufferers also suffering from depression and anxiety and i think the fact that both mood disorders and chronic inflammation are so prevalent in modern society is no coincidence alright so those are some of the most common signs of chronic inflammation but what can you do if you are chronically inflamed your focus should be on reducing inflammation some of the ways you can do this are pretty obvious but some of the other ones not so much smoking and alcohol can be two big contributors smoking has been long known to increase inflammatory markers in a 2016 report scientists showed that nicotine activates certain white blood cells which in turn release molecules that lead to increased inflammation chronic alcohol consumption impairs our gut and our liver function and can lead to intestinal inflammation so at the very least quitting smoking and reducing your alcohol intake can reduce inflammation our diets also play a big role in inflammation if we are eating inflammatory foods every single day it's no surprise that we are chronically inflamed some of the most inflammatory foods include refined sugar margarine and vegetable oils such as canola soybean and corn oil refined carbohydrates and grains and anything that is ultra processed if you can cut these things out of your diet your inflammation will be reduced and then we have exercise moderate physical exercise stimulates the immune system and produces an anti-inflammatory cellular response this is as easy as just going for a couple of walks throughout the day you don't need to run and you don't need to weight train yes those types of exercise can be beneficial but just getting your body moving at all is most important and then sleep sleep is so important for much of what our bodies do it is our body's chance to recover and getting proper and adequate sleep can help to keep our immune system healthy and finally we want to reduce stress reduce stress equals reduced inflammation cortisol which is our body's stress hormone has the ability to both stimulate and suppress the immune system acute stress stimulates it and chronic stress suppresses it anyways guys that's all i have

meeting of coolers and large coolers you might want to get a shot down here if you can't close up of the that gives you a regular recommendation sizes what we recommend just as a side note is that use about the same amount of ice the same amount of Marta guys it counts as you would regular eyes for better results right",

        "video_title": "Heal Bursitis Naturally",
        "video_sub_title": "Hi I'm Dr. Jason Barker with the Natural Athlete's Clinic. I want to teach you how you can heal up bursitis naturally. So what is bursitis? It's inflammation of a bursa sac - bursa sacs are tiny fluid filled little bags of tissue that are in areas of your body where two different types of tissue slide past each other with ease. So think about between bone and muscle, tendons and skin, you've got about 150 different bursa sacks around your body. Typically you're going to get bursitis in your large joints so think elbows, shoulders, knees, hips and even on your bottom from sitting onto a hard surface for example. So bursitis comes on very strong - it can be very painful. You can have some pretty major swelling with it, for instance in the olecranon area of the elbow, if you have bursitis it's gonna look like you have a little golf ball shoved inside of your elbow that are sticking out. You're gonna have lack of range of motion there, some heat, some redness, things like that. So how do you treat bursitis? Conventionally usually they're gonna inject a steroid in there to decrease the inflammation and or in really severe cases, they'll surgically remove the bursa. And of course we don't want you to have a steroid injection or getting surgery on that because of course you need those. So how do we heal these up naturally? Well I have kind of a three pronged natural medicine approach that I use - and before we do those though, you want to compress this with an ace bandage to keep that sac compressed so it doesn't continue to fill with fluid. You can use ice on bursa - ice is okay on bursa sacs but it's not okay on tendons and ligaments because too much ice can create some degeneration in those tendons and ligaments and we want those to retain their lasting qualities - that's not really what's going on in the bursitis so feel free to use ice on there too. So natural medicines that we use first are some natural anti-inflammatory botanical medicines, or herbal medicines and the first one is Boswellia - this is an extract from Frankincense. And then the second is Curcumin - an extract from turmeric. I talk about this one all the time. Those are the two most powerful natural anti-inflammatories - they'll put that fire out very very quickly for you. Second approach is using omega-3 fatty acids. We get most of these from fish oil, but you can also get vegan sources of omega-3's. Omega-3's work to lubricate the inside of our body - so you think about if you have dry eye, omega-3's are great for getting rid of that. The studies say with people with achy, sore joints using omega-3's can decrease that achiness and the pain in there so think of using omega-3's as a lubricant. While we're talking about lubrication, you need to make sure that you're well hydrated. People can get bursitis springing up because they're out exercising and they've been dehydrated, so that tissue dries just ever so slightly - it's enough to create extra friction and boom now you've got bursitis. So make sure you're hydrating as well along with those fatty acids. And then the third approach are proteolytic enzymes - proteolytic enzymes are nature's cleanup crew. So when you have inflammation, you've got a lot of pro-inflammatory irritating chemicals in that tissue. Those enzymes go through there and clean out those chemicals, kind of clean up the mess of that tissue can heal up. So think omega-3 fatty acids, natural anti-inflammatory botanical medicines, and proteolytic enzymes. So we love Mountain Peaks anti-inflammatory formula that has the proteolytic enzymes and it has the anti-inflammatory botanical medicines in it, with a bunch of other ones too. So there's Rhuten, Hesperidin, Quercetin, Devil's claw and some other proteolytic enzymes in there too. So that's an all-in-one. Of course we also like Mountain Peaks essential fatty acids - it's about 400 milligrams of omega-3's per capsule and or we use Pharmax's Finest Pure Fish Oil. That's about 2,000 milligrams of omega-3's per teaspoon. So if you really need to dose it high, you can use a liquid. It actually tastes good too. So if you're in a ton of pain, we also use Mountain Peaks Musculoskeletal Injury Formula - that one has all the nutrients and natural medicines in there for relieving pain rapidly. So hopefully you can use these things to heal up your bursitis. If you enjoyed the video, give it a like of course. Please share it with any of your buddies that are suffering from this and they want to avoid conventional steroids or surgery on this. And of course please subscribe to our Channel!",

        "video_title": "H1N1 (Swine Flu) - Closed Captioned",
        "video_sub_title": "Dr. Bresee: Hello. I'm Dr. Joe Bresee with the CDC Influenza Division. I'm here to speak with you today about swine flu. First I'll begin by explaining what swine flu is. Swine flu is a respiratory disease of pigs caused by type A influenza viruses. Outbreaks of swine flu happen regularly in pigs. People do not normally get swine flu, but human infections can and do occur. Most commonly, human cases of swine flu happen in people who are around pigs, but it's possible for swine-flu viruses to spread from person to person, also. The symptoms of swine flu in people are similar to the symptoms of regular human flu and include fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, headache, chills, and fatigue. Some people have reported diarrhea and vomiting associated with swine flu as well. In the past, severe illnesses such as pneumonia and respiratory failure, as well as deaths, have been reported with swine-influenza infection in people as well. Like seasonal flu, swine flu may cause a worsening of underlying chronic medical conditions. I'll now discuss the severity of swine-flu illnesses in people. Similar to seasonal flu, swine flu in humans can vary in severity from mild to severe. Between 2005 until January 2009, 12 human cases of swine flu were detected in the United States with no deaths occurring. However, swine-flu infection can be serious. In September 1988, a previously healthy 32-year-old pregnant woman in Wisconsin was hospitalized for pneumonia after being infected with swine flu, and she died eight days later. A swine-flu outbreak in Fort Dix, New Jersey, occurred in 1976 that caused more than 200 cases with severe illness in several people and one death. Spread of swine flu can occur in two ways. The first way is through contact with infected pigs or environments contaminated with swine-flu viruses. The second way is through contact with a person infected with the swine-flu virus. Human-to-human spread of swine flu has also been documented and is thought to occur in the same way as seasonal flu. Influenza is thought to be spread mainly person-to-person through coughing or sneezing of infected people. Next I would like to tell you about medicines that can be used to treat swine flu. CDC recommends the use of oseltamivir or zanamivir for the treatment and, alternatively, the prevention of infection with these swine-flu viruses. Antiviral drugs are prescription medicines such as pills, liquids, or an inhaler that fights against the flu by keeping flu viruses from reproducing in your body. If you get sick, antiviral drugs can make your illness milder and can make you feel better faster. They may also prevent serious flu complications. For treatment, antiviral drugs work best if started soon after getting sick, specifically within two days of symptoms. People with swine-influenza infection should be considered potentially contagious as long as they are symptomatic and possibly for up to seven days following the illness onset. Children, especially younger children, might potentially be contagious for longer periods. There is no vaccine available right now to protect against swine flu. However, there are everyday actions that people can take to help prevent the spread of germs that cause respiratory illnesses like influenza. Take these everyday steps to protect your health. Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw the tissue in the trash after you use it. Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially after you cough or sneeze. Alcohol-based hand cleaners are also effective. Try to avoid close contact with sick people. If you get sick with influenza, CDC recommends that you stay home from work or school and limit contact with others to keep from infecting them. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth because germs can spread that way. Now I will move on to discuss what you should do if you get sick. If you live in an area where swine-flu infections have been reported and if you become ill with influenza-like symptoms, including fever, body aches, runny nose, sore throat, nausea, or vomiting or diarrhea, you may want to contact your healthcare provider, particularly if you're worried about your symptoms. Your healthcare provider will determine whether influenza testing or treatment is needed. If you're sick, you should stay home and avoid contact with other people as much as possible to keep from spreading your illness to others. If you become ill and experience any of the following warning signs, seek emergency medical care. In children, emergency warning signs that need urgent medical attention include fast breathing or trouble breathing, bluish skin color, not drinking enough fluids, not waking up or not interacting, being so irritable that the child does not want to be held, fever with a rash, or flu-like symptoms that improve but then return with a fever and worse cough. In adults, emergency warning signs that need urgent medical attention include difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, pain or pressure in the chest or abdomen, sudden dizziness, confusion, and severe or persistent vomiting. People don't need to worry about eating or preparing pork. Swine-influenza viruses are not spread by food. Eating properly handled and cooked pork products is safe.",

        "video_sub_title": "hello it's Monday I can't believe it's Monday it was a very very quick weekend anyway somebody actually asked me in a private message about this so I'm making a video in my bathroom they didn't ask me about my bathroom habits I just happened to be here and the shelf that's in my bathroom makes it easy for me to be at the right height and I still have a little bit of light left in the daytime because of daylight savings time which I like a lot of people don't like very much I like it when it's lighter later during the day anyway they asked me they said I see in your videos where your hair is up you don't have it in a full ponytail how do you do it and it's actually very easy but I know that a lot of guys who are growing out their hair have never had to deal with making a ponytail or making a half ponytail or a bun or anything I don't have enough hair to make a full bun or the hair is it weird lengths I haven't cut my hair in almost 15 months or 16 months depending on how you count it so it's it grew out from a layered cut which where it was buzzed on the sides and longer on the top and oddly enough you know just the way that it grows the stuff at the top is fairly long but it's not quite long enough to all fit in sort of a bun sort of situation plus I don't think that the bun looks really good on the top of my head it's just not something that I think suits me all that well anyway so I thought that I would just do a quick update on how I wear my hair up to go to work just keep it out of my face or whatever um so my hair is fairly thick but fine which means that it doesn't really hold any shape if I just lift it up and let it go just flattens out it has no curl to it other than when it hits my shoulders it will curl up a little bit or if I pull it back then the oil will actually curl it up a little bit because it's been held in the same place but for the most part its stick straight fine texture thick amount of hair so this might work for you might not so what I do is I will gather my hair I usually use two thumbs or around my eyebrows and I pull it back that's mostly to get this one little piece this little piece that is the bane of my existence I could use a wave a hairpin what do you call it bobby pin you could use that to hold it back but I mess with my hair so much it would just look strange and probably pop out so I tend to just tuck it underneath if it doesn't fit but that's the piece that I'm trying to capture so I'll pull that around to my back and then I pull the rest of my hair around to the back I have no idea what the back of my head looks like this is going to be a revelation so I've got it all gathered and smooth don't worry too much about smoothing it from the top you can smooth it later and then I have my hair tie in my right hand and I'm just going to pull it up over and pull the rest of it through so probably be easier if my hair was all one length I make a figure 8 and pull it back so now I have two loops around it and this third loop I'm going to open up with my fingers like this and capture the rest of the tail and pull it halfway through kind of flatten it down on my head and as you can see this one piece is a little bit you just kind of annoying there so that's it that's what I do is my hair I hope I captured that I'm going to see it so what I basically have is this which isn't quite a bun it isn't it's I don't mind a long ponytail I think it looks fine but it can be very hot on the back of your neck um and it also curls quite a bit because it hits the back of my shoulders and it curls right up so that's basically somebody asked me so I figured other people might be interested maybe not anyway that's my Monday morning Monday morning Monday afternoon tutorial thanks",

        "video_sub_title": "so how do you actually do a proper hand scrub in this video today we're going to be talking about scrubbing your hands before surgery how do you actually do it what's up everyone this is dr. Webb here thank you guys for watching this video make sure you subscribe new videos come in every week you don't want to miss them so before every surgery that we actually perform as surgeons we have to scrub our hands and usually that's the first thing that we do in the morning before starting our day surgical site infection is a big problem in healthcare and one of the ways we minimize infections and surgery is to shrub our hands usually we use a brush similar to this one this is called abd easy shrub brush here and this brush and this soap that is within the brush here is outside of the operating room we have sinks here that we can use to shrub our hands and then we have these brushes here so essentially you can rip this open here it's pretty easy to open this if you notice that within the package here there's a little plastic piece this plastic piece is to clean under your fingernails so before surgery you want to make sure that you place this item here under your fingernails and clean out all the dirt and gunk that's under your fingernails usually you have to remove your jury your watches and your rings before you actually scrub so the first thing that you want to do is actually wet your hands part of this process of scrubbing your hands your hands have to be straight up in the air that should be never below your waist and once you actually shrub you should not touch anything that's not sterile your consider sterile after scrubbing your hands so the brush the first thing you want to do is use the bristle part here the bristle part is essentially to be used for your fingernails usually I will do this for 20 to 30 seconds and each of my fingernails to make sure that they're clean before I go into surgery you notice my hands are always up this way and after you clean your fingernails you turn it back over and use the softer part here the softer part and be used to scrub the dorsum of your hand some people say do this for 20 or 30 times usually I start off at each finger I get each side going to each finger here and then you use the palm of your hand the same softair portion of the brush here I usually work my way down the forearm and then stop usually about mid form or so then I'll repeat this process on the other hand so using the bristle type portion for your fingernails and then turn in and over to use a software portion for the dorsum or the back portion of your wrists getting each finger both sides and then the palm of your hand and after you shrub this essentially you can throw away it's essentially a one-time use and then I just basically throw it in the trash can hands are up in the air and essentially I'm just rinsing off of these soap of my hands so when I walk into surgery my hands are usually like this the operating-room tech will hand me a towel to dry my hands usually someone opens the door for you so you're not touching anything that's not sterile you put your sterile gloves on you put your stove gown on I hope you guys learned something in this video thank you for watching make sure you subscribe and we'll see you on the next one [Music]",

        "video_title": "Vocal Cord Swelling Checks: A Simple Way to Detect the Early Signs of Vocal Injury",
        "video_sub_title": "Hello, I'm Dr. Robert Bastian. My subject is what\u00a0 we call vocal fold swelling checks. \u00a0\u00a0 Vocal fold swelling checks are designed to let you detect\u00a0 vocal fold injury early. Even before you would\u00a0\u00a0 know it is there if you didn't use the swelling\u00a0 checks. And the point of it is that if you catch\u00a0\u00a0 vocal fold injury early, you can avoid something\u00a0 like this happening to your voice: (Hoarse voice of a patient singing \"Happy Birthday\") Think of it this way; our voices are often\u00a0 dressed up with layers of clothing. We use loudness\u00a0\u00a0 as a layer of clothing, or focus, or resonance\u00a0 or vowel shading. But these layers of clothing,\u00a0\u00a0 sometimes called vocal technique, can cover up the\u00a0 presence of vocal folds swelling or injury. So with\u00a0\u00a0 these swelling checks, we're going to remove\u00a0 those layers of clothing from the voice.\u00a0\u00a0 These swelling checks are purely for early detection\u00a0 of any possible injury, and they're not for voice\u00a0\u00a0 grooming or development, and they're certainly not\u00a0 for performance. Now back a step. What part of the\u00a0\u00a0 vocal fold is it that can swell? Well, it's called\u00a0 mucosa. Mucosa is the lining tissue in our mouths,\u00a0\u00a0 in our nose, down in the throat, in the airway here.\u00a0 And just as skin is to the outside of the neck\u00a0\u00a0 and the rest of us, outside of the neck, and all of\u2014\u00a0 the all of the outside of us, just so mucosa lines\u00a0\u00a0 the inside of us. Now vocal fold mucosa, right\u00a0 here, is very special. It's made for vibration\u00a0\u00a0 and it is the sound source of the voice. And yet,\u00a0 the very vibration mucosa is designed for\u2014if it\u00a0\u00a0 goes too far, if it's excessive\u2014that vibration\u00a0 can cause swelling or bruising. Now both simple,\u00a0\u00a0 early swelling and simple bruising are easy and\u00a0 fast to resolve if they're detected early. But, if\u00a0\u00a0 they're not detected early and they're maintained,\u00a0 we keep concealing with clothing and we, we don't\u00a0\u00a0 pay attention to the signals of that swelling. Then\u00a0 over time, we can\u2014without really fully recognizing\u00a0\u00a0 that we're doing it\u2014we can develop nodules or\u00a0 polyps; kinds of injuries that take quite a bit\u00a0\u00a0 longer that are much more difficult to resolve\u00a0 then early simple swelling. So we want to help\u00a0\u00a0 you avoid that crisis that can happen if you\u00a0 overlook, or deny, or cover up swelling over a\u00a0period of time.  Now there is a group of people for\u00a0 whom the swelling checks are especially important. We call them vocal over-doers, and define them as\u00a0 having extroverted personality. But they also\u2014due to\u00a0\u00a0 that extroverted, talkative personality\u2014typically\u00a0 are involved in lives that are highly vocal.\u00a0\u00a0 Now anyone can injure his or her vocal fold mucosa, but\u00a0 the vocal over-doer group are the most likely to do\u00a0\u00a0 this. And a subset of that vocal over-doer group who\u00a0 are professional voice users, or who are performers,\u00a0\u00a0 the stakes are particularly high in that group\u00a0 to avoid chronic injury. So the swelling checks\u00a0\u00a0 are useful to you whether you're normal, whether\u00a0 you're a little swollen but still quite happy\u00a0\u00a0 with your voice because it does for you what\u00a0 you need it to, or if you're quite frustrated.\u00a0\u00a0 In any of those three circumstances, the swelling\u00a0 checks can be useful because they all let you know\u00a0\u00a0 the status of your mucosa. Well finally, let's\u00a0 get to the vocal fold mucosal swelling checks\u00a0\u00a0 themselves. To design them, we'd want to include\u00a0 very high pitch because that's where trouble is\u00a0\u00a0 most apparent. If we use low voice, we're going to\u00a0 conceal, but high voice is going to reveal swelling.\u00a0\u00a0 The second requirement of a good swelling check\u00a0 would be a vocal task that is very soft, because\u00a0\u00a0 if we use loud voice we can force swollen vocal\u00a0 folds to work and therefore conceal the swelling.\u00a0\u00a0 Soft voice by contrast reveals. And then we might\u00a0 add the idea of staccato; a lot of onsets. An onset\u00a0\u00a0 is the moment when the voice speaks. So if we do\u00a0 a lot of, \"O, O, O, O, O\" We have more of those onsets to judge\u00a0\u00a0 whether they're working or not. Well you could\u00a0 design a lot of different swelling checks but\u00a0\u00a0 we have found two seemed to be sufficient, and let\u00a0 me tell you what they are. We use the first phrase\u00a0\u00a0 of \"happy birthday\" and we often change the words\u00a0 almost to: \"Hebby-birthday-do-you\" because it's\u00a0\u00a0 easier to sing in a very connected. So we want\u00a0 to keep it very connected and it goes like this: Just the first phrase not the whole song.\u00a0 So that includes high and soft.  Then the\u00a0\u00a0second check is staccato, it's: \u00a0 That one\u00a0targets not just high and soft, but also a\u00a0 lot of onsets. Now each of these two checks\u00a0 is repeated semitone by semitone to find what\u00a0\u00a0 we call your initial mucosal ceiling. So let me\u00a0 demonstrate with the happy birthday. You might do: And then at a certain point it's going to\u00a0kind of resist a little.  So I'll mimic what\u00a0that would sound like:  See how it doesn't want\u00a0to happen?  So that \"OOooOoO\" would be my initial mucosal\u00a0ceiling. So right that pitch down and you\u00a0 know that's where your your mucosa wants\u00a0\u00a0 to, to not cooperate. For staccato, it might be:\u00a0\u00a0 And then it will fail it or start to struggle\u00a0it at a point: See how I'm mimicking, but it\u00a0 doesn't want to work at\u2014so I write down: \"Yooo\" as my\u00a0\u00a0 initial mucosal ceiling. Now I can make it work\u00a0 by just getting louder at those initial mucosal\u00a0\u00a0 ceilings, but that's not the point. The point is\u00a0 to produce it and see where that wants to happen. Well up to this point, we've established that the\u00a0 mucosa\u2014here on the surface of the vocal folds\u2014is\u00a0\u00a0 the part of the vocal folds that's the most\u00a0 vulnerable to injury. And also, that we need an\u00a0\u00a0 early detection tool to detect early injury before\u00a0 we're really all that aware of it. And we also\u00a0\u00a0 know that a good detection tool needs to remove\u00a0 layers of clothing from the voice, because those\u00a0\u00a0 layers will conceal the injury. And so, those tests,\u00a0 those checks need to be extremely high pitch, very\u00a0\u00a0 soft, and often we use multiple onsets as well.\u00a0 We've taught you our two favorite vocal folds\u00a0\u00a0 swelling checks:  and .  So now, let's answer the final\u00a0question: what is the  strategy for the application\u00a0of the swelling checks over time? First, commit to\u00a0doing the swelling checks twice a day, every single\u00a0day. The first time of the day, if you're a singer,\u00a0 should be before your warmup. Because if you think\u00a0\u00a0 of it, warmup is actually like the first layer of\u00a0 clothing on the voice. And then I often suggest the\u00a0\u00a0 second time to do it just before bed. 20 seconds\u00a0 each time. Second, lock-in on producing your voice\u00a0\u00a0 for the swelling checks exactly the same every day.\u00a0 It can't be  one day, and  (louder).\u00a0\u00a0 You have to absolutely resist getting louder because\u00a0 remember, this is for detection and not performance/\u00a0\u00a0 And a word to singers; I'm not sure I've ever\u00a0 taught these these little checks to singers\u00a0\u00a0 without having to say \"Oh no no, that's way too\u00a0 loud you need to be much much softer.\" And a little\u00a0\u00a0 comment to men; I'm using falsetto a lot, but in men,\u00a0 sometimes varied highlight chest voice  is quite\u00a0\u00a0 sensitive, and especially when you're getting near\u00a0 where the voice wants to switch over into falsetto.\u00a0\u00a0 So you do them every day, you do them exactly\u00a0 the same every day, and third, you compare each\u00a0\u00a0 day's mucosal ceiling with the original that you\u00a0 determined a week ago, many months ago, or even\u00a0\u00a0 years ago. Now for lots of people this may be all\u00a0 the swelling tests ever are. You know your mucosal\u00a0\u00a0 ceiling, you just do your swelling test day after\u00a0 day, they fluctuate by a semitone or two or three\u00a0\u00a0 around what you've established is normal for you,\u00a0 and all as well. But what if you are a person who\u00a0\u00a0 notes that for a day or for a series of days\u00a0 your normal is off by three or four semitones?\u00a0\u00a0 It's lower. And you start to fluctuate around\u00a0 that new initial mucosal ceiling that isn't as\u00a0\u00a0 good, meaning it is lower. Well here's what you\u00a0 do. On the first day especially, stop and think\u00a0\u00a0 about the past 24 hours. Ask yourself, \"Does it make\u00a0 sense that my swelling checks have deteriorated?\"\u00a0\u00a0 \"Has there been extra voice use?\" \"Have I been at an\u00a0 athletic event? \"Was there a party or a long phone\u00a0\u00a0 call, or did I rehearse more than my usual?\" Now\u00a0 you ask these questions of yourself because any\u00a0\u00a0 of those kinds of things might have inadvertently,\u00a0 very unintentionally and almost outside of your\u00a0\u00a0 consciousness, produced very temporary vocal folds\u00a0 swelling. You can warm it up and sort of goes away\u00a0\u00a0 and you can get a little louder, but you've got a\u00a0 little bit of swelling. So if you do that little\u00a0\u00a0 review of the past 24 hours and the answer is \"Yes,\u00a0 I guess this does make sense. I can tell you what\u00a0\u00a0 I did that was too much.\" Then what you do is to\u00a0 back off\u2014as I'll explain in a moment\u2014until your\u00a0\u00a0 swelling checks revert to their normal level.\u00a0 A second scenario might be that you say, \"There\u00a0\u00a0 isn't an obvious explanation for this difference\u00a0 in my swelling checks.\" So it's kind of appropriate\u00a0\u00a0 that the first time or two that happens you\u00a0 can kind of shrug and say \"Well, I'll find out\u00a0\u00a0 what the swelling checks do the next time, but not\u00a0 more than 12 hours later.\" There could be a third\u00a0\u00a0 scenario where day after day you can't identify\u00a0 why, but you notice your swelling checks are not\u00a0\u00a0 quite what they should be. In this third case, you\u00a0 might back off of voice use anyway just to see\u00a0\u00a0 if it makes the swelling checks return to their\u00a0 normal level. And if not, if they continue to be not\u00a0\u00a0 quite right, you can begin to think\u2014after a couple\u00a0 or three or four weeks of putting the wheels in\u00a0\u00a0 motion\u2014to have someone look at your vocal folds.\u00a0 Well, if we go back to the first scenario where\u00a0\u00a0 you say, \"Definitely I know what I've done. This\u00a0 is clearly from XYZ, and I've got some swelling.\"\u00a0\u00a0 What do you do to back off? If you have a lot of\u00a0 meetings in your day, try to space them. Don't do\u00a0\u00a0 them back-to-back but put time between where you\u00a0 can be quiet. If you're going to a social event,\u00a0\u00a0 or a party, or a loud restaurant, you can consider\u00a0 canceling or changing to a different venue or at\u00a0\u00a0 least alerting the people that you're going to be\u00a0 with that you'll be a little quiet but you're not\u00a0\u00a0 depressed or mad at them. Try to submit yourself\u00a0 to periods of silence. If you're a teacher, look at\u00a0\u00a0 your lesson plans coming up. Maybe there's a movie\u00a0 that you had planned for a few days ahead that you\u00a0\u00a0 could move to tomorrow in order to let your voice\u00a0 recover. Well there dozens of other ideas of this\u00a0\u00a0 sort. Well in summary, just as you need monitors,\u00a0 early indicators or warning lights in your car and\u00a0\u00a0 in your home, in similar fashion you need an early\u00a0 warning system for your voice. Swelling checks like:  and  can be this kind of warning system for\u00a0 you, if you will take 20 seconds twice a day to do\u00a0\u00a0 them. And then respond appropriately to what they\u00a0 tell you in order to keep your mucosa healthy.\u00a0\u00a0 We might even say, \"Two vocal folds swelling checks\u00a0 a day keep the doctor away.\" Thanks for listening!",

        "video_sub_title": "[Asian Sizes to US/European: Clothing Size Chart for Dropshipping!] Alright, so if you\u2019re an ecommerce dropshipper in the fashion niche, and your suppliers are from China, you may have noticed a little problem. Asian sizes are VERY different from US Sizes. Hey, what\u2019s up world, Tommy Walker with Oberlo and today, we\u2019re going to talk about converting Asian fashion sizes to US sizes. If you have any questions, or want to share your experiences, drop them in the comments below, and I'll be sure to answer them Like I said before, I\u2019m your host, Tommy Walker, and if you like what we\u2019re talking about here, consider subscribing, so you can get new videos every week. Now, as a dropshipper, having sizes that are too small for your customers could have a disastrous impact on your business. Uh\u2026 hi. I ordered the wrong size on your website, can I get a refund? It\u2019s extremely important that you\u2019re up-front on your website about how the Asian sizes convert to US sizes or the sizing that\u2019s local to whatever market you\u2019re selling in in order to minimize size-related returns. So how can you get this information? 1. You can talk to your supplier. Each supplier you work with may have different size charts. Some products may have a tight fit while others have a looser fit. If you want to speed up the process, you can ask them for their Asian to American size chart and add that image to those suppliers\u2019 products on your website if you sell exclusively to the United States. If for some reason a supplier doesn\u2019t respond or is unable to provide you with a size chart, you\u2019ll need to stick to a standard Asian to US size chart. Unfortunately, this size chart may not be completely accurate, but it\u2019s a start. Check out the links in the description to download the standardized chart for yourself. 2. Use supplier\u2019s measurements to create your own size chart Here\u2019s the tricky thing about numbers, they\u2019re hard to visualize. So while some suppliers will give you the product measurements without a size chart. And Other suppliers will offer a size chart with their definitions of each size... Unless you\u2019re a tailor or seamstress who sees what these measurements look like regularly, it can be difficult to translate those measurements to standard US \u201cSmall\u201d \u201cMedium\u201d and \u201cLarge\u201d sizes for your own brand. While it does mean a bit more work and investment for you, it\u2019s a smart idea to order at least one size of each of the products you\u2019re selling, and style them on an adjustable male or female form that is set to the different measurements the supplier has provided. That way, you\u2019ll know for certain that your supplier\u2019s definition of sizes translate to your own, an XL is your Large, for example, and you\u2019ll have a basic understanding of how the clothing might look on a customer, which can save you a lot on customer service, returns, and exchanges in the future. Also just because you have these sizes on-hand, doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t sell them. In fact, depending on how far along your fashion business is, it may be worth using these pieces for your own photoshoots. If you\u2019re a dropshipper that does this, or something like it, we\u2019d love to hear your experience about how this has worked for you in the comments section! 3. Make your size charts clear for each audience you service This is more a pretty general rule of thumb for any fashion ecommerce website, but make the size information easily accessible on the page for your visitor. Like I mentioned earlier in the video, a significant portion of consumers end up returning clothing because it is often the wrong size, and an even larger portion of ecommerce sites don\u2019t make their size guide incredibly visible. Even on this very large multi-million dollar brand\u2019s website, the link to the sizing chart doesn\u2019t really stand out. If you\u2019re selling in international markets, like Europe, you\u2019ll want to make sure you\u2019re converting to that market\u2019s sizing as well, however, don\u2019t feel the need to go overboard and make conversions for every country in the world! If you want to make all of this even easier on your customers, there are size finder apps that you can download from the Shopify App store that will make size recommendations for your customer based on their height, weight age and body type. Apps like these have been known to increase sales, reduce returns, and encourage repeat purchase rates, which is essential for the long-term health of any new fashion brand. Ok, that\u2019s all we\u2019ve got for this week. Check out the description for more in-depth resources on size conversions, and starting your own dropshipping store with Oberlo. Also, I\u2019d love to hear your stories about ordering the wrong size. How did the company handle it? Did they win you back as a customer, or leave you in a tight place.

        "video_sub_title": "(bright music) (clock ticking) - [Narrator] What foods can help keep my pancreas healthy? - So I've heard this  question before, what can I eat to keep my  pancreas healthy? And I think really the answer lies in reframing the question, and what foods should  I avoid to maintain my pancreatic health? I think a lot of people know that the pancreas is responsible for diabetes, and when we think about diabetes we think about improving the function of our pancreas. The most important thing is limiting simple sugars and what we refer to as white carbs or white carbohydrates. So these are things like white bread, rolls, pasta, tortillas, sugar, any sort of sweets and candies and things like that, because that's very taxing to our sugar metabolism system. Now there are a couple supplements that you can take that can improve your  sugar metabolism, specifically cinnamon and chromium have been known to improve the metabolism of sugar slightly. But it's certainly not a replacement for a proper diet that is low in simple sugars. So the most important thing is to limit your sugar intake and your sweet intake and  these so-called white carbohydrates and get plenty of regular exercise.",

        "video_title": "9 Signs You Have A Sugar Intolerance, That You're Probably Missing",
        "video_sub_title": "9 Signs You Have A Sugar Intolerance, That You're Probably Missing If you have even the tiniest hint of a sweet tooth, you likely know the exact ins and outs of how indulging in sugary-sweet treats makes you feel \u2014 for better or for worse. Feel particularly terrible after a holiday party, night out, or one too many trips to the candy and donuts in the break room and you might start to wonder if your body actually doesn't handle sugar all that well. While sugar allergies are possible, they're rare, but there are a lot of signs your body is intolerant to sugar, which is more likely to be what's ailing you. So what's the difference between an allergy and intolerance anyway? \"When a person is allergic to a food item, it\u2019s not so much that they\u2019re allergic to the sugar, but they\u2019re allergic to some type of protein that\u2019s in that food,\" Charmaine Jones, registered dietitian and founder of Food Jonezi, tells Romper. \"And what happens is, when you are allergic to a certain protein that\u2019s in a food item, your body\u2019s immune system is mistaking that protein for a foreign invader, like a virus or bacteria, so it just automatically sends out or releases chemicals to fight off this protein and the chemical that is released unfortunately [causes] your body to break out in hives or cause an allergy reaction.\" Food allergies can be life-threatening. They're no joke. Food intolerances, on the other hand, aren't usually life-threatening. \"[I]f a person that is food intolerant, they are intolerant to that specific sugar and that means that your body is unable to or [has] problems digesting that sugar,\" Jones explains. That's not to say that they don't cause problems of their own, but they won't kill you. There are probably more things that can qualify as \"sugar\" than you realized. Lactose, maltose, dextrose, sucrose, and the like are all forms of sugar. The -ose suffix can help you figure out if something might be a sugar, so it's handy to keep that in mind when reading labels. If you think that you're intolerant to sugar or sugar alcohols \u2014 Jones says some people are extra sensitive to those as well \u2014 there are a few things you need to look out for. And your gut is at the center of it all. 1You're Bloated Bloating is never comfortable. You just feel puffy and lethargic and, well, gross. If your body is struggling to digest a particular sugar, whether it's lactose or something else, it can cause you to bloat as that sugar tries to make its way through your digestive system, Jones says. If you tend not to notice when you feel bloated, the good news (or bad news) is that you'll likely have other, perhaps more noticeable symptoms as well. 2You Get Gassy Excess gas can also be a sign that you're intolerant to sugar, as registered dietitian Vanessa Rissetto tells Romper by email. Taking medications that help alleviate gas might help mitigate the problematic symptom, but it won't help with the underlying intolerance, so you might want to avoid whatever sugar it is that resulted in you feeling slightly gassier than usual. 3You Have Anxiety Feeling more anxious lately? While you may not think that a sugar intolerance could be the cause, as naturopath Kristen Swales tells Romper by email, your anxiety actually could indicate that your body isn't handling an influx of sugar all that well. Cutting back on your sugar intake could help relieve that anxiety and help you feel more grounded. 4You Feel Nauseous Rissetto notes that nausea can also be indicator that you have a sugar intolerance, especially when paired with other gastrointestinal symptoms like gas and bloating. \"In some cases, the best solution is avoidance,\" naturopathic physician Dr. Jennifer Stagg tells Romper by email. That can be a difficult proposition, but if it helps you feel better, it might be worth it. 5You Have The Worst Stomach Ache Stomach cramping is never ever comfortable \u2014 or easy to ignore. Sugar intolerances, like lactose intolerance, can cause intense stomach cramping, Jones remarks. It makes sense, if you think about it. Your body can't digest it well, and so when it shows up in your digestive system, things go a little haywire. According to Stagg, \"if it\u2019s an issue with glucose regulation, then eating sugar as part of a meal containing fat and protein will slow down the absorption of sugar in the intestinal tract.\" Think about how your pairing your foods, as well as what you're specifically eating. 6You Crash After Eating It Surely you've experienced a sugar crash before, after eating a bit too much of it. According to Swales, however, major energy dips after you eat sugar might also indicate that your body isn't handling it well. If this is your only symptom, it doesn't necessarily mean for sure that you have a sugar intolerance, but it could be an initial hint that something else is going on. 7You Deal With Joint Inflammation Sugar causes inflammation, which isn't good for your body. Swales says that sugar intolerances can cause joint pain and inflammation in particular, but, it can also just cause inflammation in general. \"Inflammation is an underlying factor in most chronic diseases,\" Stagg says. For that reason, it's important to be cognizant of how much sugar you're eating, whether you're intolerant to it or not. 8You're Not Sleeping Well Sleep is super important for your overall health, but, annoyingly, there are a lot of things that can interfere with it, whether it's too much caffeine, a lumpy mattress, or a baby that requires your middle-of-the-night attention. According to Swales, a sugar intolerance can also cause you to experience night sweats. Night sweats are uncomfortable and embarrassing, and leave you exhausted in the morning because no one can sleep soundly if they're sweaty and overheated. 9You Get A Little Shaky 'There are a wide range of symptoms that can happen if you are not tolerating sugar well \u2014 you could experience hyperactivity or shakiness a while after eating foods high in sugar,\" Stagg says. If you feel shaky \u2014 not just energized \u2014 after eating sugar, it might mean your body doesn't handle it well. Looking at the type of sugar you eat, the amount, what you eat it with, and how you eat it might help you feel better, but, as Jones emphasizes, seeing a doctor or allergist and working with a dietitian are the best ways to not only know for sure if you have an allergy or intolerance, but manage it too.",

        "video_title": "Will a Night Splint Help Your Plantar Fasciitis? We Review 3 Braces.",
        "video_sub_title": "hi folks I'm Bob Shrum physical therapist right now any physical 31 was famous physical therapist on the internet you know Peter of course title of today's program Brad is well a night splint / brace help your plantar fasciitis review we review three braces there you go so alright what we have here this is one we actually did before you don't know that but my mic wasn't working again which Brad I didn't think sabotaged it was your mic maybe maybe was yours one way or another it's gonna be a better quality film we're getting better all the time that's for a few years you know so the first thing we want to talk about today what is plantar fasciitis we went to the bottom of Napoleon's foot here to describe what plantar fasciitis actually is so we're looking at the bottom of his foot and there's actually a band that runs from the calcaneus which is your heel all the way into the toes actually you can see there's a the band is here but here to actually become strands that go into the toes and it's important to understand that because when we're doing stretches which is what you're gonna want to do this band has become damaged in some form maybe some micro tears I'm sacrificing the bottom of my foot to even to show what it looks like got a real you think it's more likely a you're sacrificing that marker Brad I think that's just become deteriorated acid so one way or another so he's showing the band on the bottom of his foot and that again gets stretched and it gets maybe torn and we need it to allow it to heal and and while it's healing you don't normally want to do a little bit of stretching on it right so and quite often when you have the pain it's gonna be real specific a lot of times right in this on the edge of the calcaneus or the bone right there right where that red spot is that's typically the hot spot where that fashio connects into there but again I'm gonna show you this because one of the stretches we have people do is we actually stretch the toes back like that and see how that stretches this band I don't know if you can see that or not but this band is stretching it's getting taut so so the purpose of you know our talk today is about braces so first off should you even use a brace and I looked up I saw quite a few studies at least four that supported the benefit of using a brace at night yeah or splint a night splint thing with night splint is what we're talking about but in almost every case what they recommended is that you also do the stretches and stuff along with it right so so you want to say a little bit about why you need the night splint because particularly if it's morning you wake up and you put weight in your foot and you get this Oh hole and that hurts and then after a while it kind of stretches out and it's not so painful if that's your symptoms one of your symptoms a night splint will likely be very advantageous for ya and theory what had happened is what we're thinking would happen is that at night it's starting to heal yeah it started to lay down some scar tissue but your foot was down like this so it healed in a tightened fashion right so as soon as you stood on it in the morning you you put a huge stretch on it and you tore it open again so you're starting all over again yeah it has to heal again so if we put you in a night splint and we have a just a gentle stretch on the foot all night long then when you wake up in the morning you're all ready to go it's already stretched out right if saline is healing in a lengthened position perfectly okay I said it perfect you did matter of fact we should do something and quote that and get it in history but we're looking for a neutral position right Bob there you go kind of like what this is done right right actually as a mate splint yeah so let's we got three braces from brace ability but before we do that Brad we didn't even do this yet we did we didn't allow people to come in and be part of our family well yeah it is cold out there but largest physical therapy family on the internet it is by the way if you are new to our Channel please take a second to subscribe to us and become part of our family we provide videos how stay healthy fit pain-free and we upload every day also go over to Facebook and become part of our family there because Brad and I as children we're not liked and we're trying to turn things around I don't know if people want to be part of the family or the fam well they start you mind if I start with this brace Brad I'm sorry I'm right here so this is a plantar fasciitis soft night sock now I like the idea of this because it's lightweight mm-hmm it might be a little warm because it does cover your whole foot up right but it's lightweight it's not gonna be bulky when I'm laying down at night you know I can i can lay I can put my foot on top of the other foot it's not gonna you know yeah I have a sharp edge that's gonna bother me you know I can move it around you can it does have a little bit of a sole on it so you can still walk on it my only criticism of this and it does work it absolutely does work because you want to have you know the part of the device where does pull the toe up just slightly and that's what this does it's just this one does take a lot of adjusting sure get it right and the first critical step is this strap right here this one that goes around the ankle this has to be very very snug if this isn't snug this strap starts to pull like this and it doesn't hold a shoe up the toe up very well so you got to spend some time you get this wrapped like this and then you bring it around like this and then you really snug this up tight and bring that around I think this would have almost been better Brad if this was up here yeah and this was going from here does that make sense it gives a little bit more leverage on that that pull you know what I'm saying to get that right yeah exactly so now you can see this is there's no gap here but what the other thing is you have to adjust this strap and and there's a little bit of a velcro piece on here that does that let's see if I can figure it out again yeah here it is so this is made like this so there's velcro on each side of this like this yeah kind of like you know crocodile mouth yeah so I want to make this strap a little show so that I have room to pull my leg up like this so I just put a fold in it like this fold and then he puts that on there like that you know I've seen other velcro systems work similar to this for adjustability yeah except you put it on wrong bread oh I flipped it upside down yeah I had put the part that goes down here yeah is there a male and a female part of velcro you know like you know talk about male and female parts of rides we don't know that I think there might be but so anyway now it's all set and I'm pulling like this and this does a good job it's pulling my toe up really well and you know what I did a good job it does gapping a little bit here but not not bad this actually the thing is you want to get a stretch but not so much that it keeps you awake at night that's the other thing and you'll have to determine that what that's going to be my wife had very good results with this by the way I mean that's why I can give a personal testimonial sir she she was having plantar fasciitis for a long time when we were doing all the treatments all the therapy treatments getting a little bit better we got a boot man and she got better like I mean it was tremendously fast I mean it was amazing within days or days yeah and then she was back to running tell them that bow within days I mean so but I don't expect that it's gonna happen to everybody like that but so I like the sock you just got to really spend the time in getting it adjusted surf and once you get that right you can see it works out quite well actually I'm gonna pull it up really well do you want to hand me my clipboard here right Brett I want to just give you the price on this so this is the plantar fasciitis soft night sock we'll have links to these below yeah it goes for $34.99 so I know they sell a lot of these sure at all all right do you want to go into this one Brad this isn't one is the brace ability sleeping stretch boot for plantar fasciitis so this one as a post that has a hard plastic shell if you will I mean there's no sharp edges everything is smooth and whatnot it's a little more cumbersome but it really does do a nice job of holding your foot in that neutral position and then they put which I haven't seen this on any other boot like this they have a wedge in here that you can put in just at your toe level so you get a little bit of toe extension yeah there's some no simulate what this does they said this gives an extra 5 degrees ok you can also adjust these straps to pull up he'll show that this will also pull the foot up so we're gonna pull like that so now you're getting a stretch that way and you're also getting a stretch with the wedge now you probably didn't see a great deal of movement when I did that but I certainly felt it on my calf muscle as well on the bottom of my foot so that is nice to have that that would be too tight I'm sure I would not want to sleep I thought I would back off a little bit right there and then they have these quick-disconnect straps right here now I would guess that this one would be a little bit cooler because you know what yeah I'm open area yeah right once you taste a bread right it's just a little you know if it if you're rolling around a lot and it might get I don't forget tangle up in there covers or not but when you get up in the morning and you feel so much better when you stand up it's gonna be worth it and if you're not gonna wear it for weeks on end anyways it's short term it is this one is more bulky and you know you could you know go up against the other leg and it might give you a little bit of trouble but I like this one I think this one really will it works well I mean I think it really does the job right it definitely puts the foot in the right position very securely and it's not it's not heavy you know and that one is $27.99 so it's a little less expensive the last one here is called the brace ability dorsal night splint dorsal means the top of the foot for you laypeople yeah and this one we're gonna be a little bit negative on this one we you know we understand what they were trying to do but the problem with this one it it doesn't pull the toes up I'm sure it pulls the foot up and you know but it doesn't give a stretch on the toes so we would not recommend this one we would and this is fine for foot drop or something like that right works fine for that I can see where it's you know be very comfortable because you know it's not going to rub against it just doesn't pull the ankle up as far and it doesn't pull the toe at all right right so and we feel that getting that whole extension is that stretch is important to get this plantar fasciitis under control brace ability is a good company they make good quality products we have always liked what they've done so you know if you if you're having some plantar fasciitis I definitely give them a look-see so see yeah there we go that's a Minnesotan thing I think all right thanks everybody for watching you",

        "video_title": "How does laser eye surgery work? - Dan Reinstein",
        "video_sub_title": "In 1948, Spanish ophthalmologist  Jose Ignacio Barraquer Moner was fed up with glasses. He wanted a solution for blurry  vision that fixed the eye itself, without relying on external aids. But the surgery he eventually devised  was not for the faint of heart. Barraquer began by slicing off the front of a patient\u2019s cornea and dunking it in liquid nitrogen. Using a miniature lathe, he ground the  frozen cornea into the precise shape necessary to focus the patient\u2019s vision. Then he thawed the disc, and sewed  it back on. Barraquer called this procedure  keratomileusis, from the Greek words for \u201ccarving\u201d  and \u201ccornea.\u201d And though it might sound grisly,  his technique produced reliable results. So how did Barraquer\u2019s surgery work? Keratomileusis corrects what are called  refractive errors: imperfections in the way the eye focuses  incoming light. Ideally, the cornea and lens work  together to focus light on the surface of the retina, but several kinds of refractive errors  can impair this delicate system. In people with myopia,  or short-sightedness, a steep cornea focuses light just short  of the retina. Those with hyperopia, or far-sightedness,  have the opposite problem: light is focused too far  beyond the retina. And in people with astigmatism,  the cornea has two different curvatures which focus light at two distances and  produce blurry vision. Even those with perfect vision will  eventually suffer from presbyopia, or \u201caging eyes.\u201d As the proteins in the lens age, they  slowly increase its size. By an adult\u2019s mid-40\u2019s, the lens is too large to easily change shape and shift focus. Glasses and contact lenses bend light  to compensate for these refractive errors. But, as Barraquer\u2019s procedure shows, we can also alter the shape  of the cornea itself; moving the focal point backwards,  forwards, or pulling a divided image together. And thankfully, modern eye surgeons can  sculpt the cornea with far less invasive tools. In corrective laser eye surgery, surgeons  rely on excimer lasers. These tools are accurate enough to etch  words into a human hair. To safely accomplish these  ultra-fine incisions, they use a technique called photoablation. This allows the laser to essentially  evaporate organic tissue without overheating  surrounding eye tissue. So how does laser eye surgery  actually work? The first step is to separate a thin layer from the front of the cornea. This can be done with either a flat,  wide blade, or a femto-second laser that produces millions of tiny plasma  bubbles to create a plane beneath  the corneal surface. Surgeons then lift the flap to expose the  inside of the cornea. Guided by the refractive error and the  shape of the cornea, the excimer laser robotically sculpts the exposed corneal bed into the correct shape. This process usually takes less than 30  seconds for each eye. Finally, the flap is closed, and its edges reseal themselves  in just a few hours. Because the lasering is done on  the eyeball itself, it\u2019s described as \u201cin situ,\u201d or \u201con site.\u201d Its complete name is \u201claser in-situ  keratomileusis\u201d \u2013 but you probably know it as LASIK. Essentially, this technique carves a  patient\u2019s contact lens prescription onto their cornea. Like any surgical procedure, LASIK comes with certain risks. Some patients experience slightly blurred vision that can\u2019t be corrected by glasses. But the technique is currently about  as likely to damage your eyes as wearing daily disposable contact  lenses for one year. Today, a technique called SMILE enables  surgeons to sculpt the cornea through even smaller incisions \u2013 further reducing recovery time. And lasers aren\u2019t just correcting the  three types of refractive errors \u2013 this technology can also  restore aging eyes. In a technique called Laser  Blended Vision, surgeons adjust one eye to be slightly  better at distance vision and the other to be better  at close range vision. The difference between the two eyes is  small enough that most patients can merge their vision, allowing both eyes to work  together at all distances. Advances in laser technology continue  to make vision correction surgery more effective and accessible. One day soon, Barraquer\u2019s vision of a  world without glasses may finally come true.",

        "video_title": "Managing Allergic Reactions (1): Using an epipen... and how NOT to do it!",
        "video_sub_title": "[Music] Oliver thank you for coming um as you know you reacted to the curry that had cashew nut in and because it was quite an unpleasant reaction where you had some difficulty breathing we talked about giving you an adrenaline pen to carry around all the time so that if you were caught out in the future and had a problem you've got something that will help you while the ambulance is on its way okay so I'm going to explain to you how to use the EpiPen now this is a real EpiPen and it contains adrenaline and what we're going to show you is how you would inject it into the muscle in your leg to help you and the good news about the adrenaline is it helps all three of the serious things that can happen in a bad anaphylactic reaction those things are first of all asthma where you get very tight breathing the second is when your voice box goes very swollen and you have difficulty breathing in and the third thing that can happen sometimes is your blood pressure can fall but the good news is that the adrenaline will help all three of those problems [Music] now I'm going to show you a trainer practice pen which looks like this and this hasn't got any adrenaline in it or a needle in it so we use it for practicing how to do it properly okay the first thing to tell you is that when you hold the pen you hold it in a fist lots of people think they need to use their thumb but you don't just hold it in a fist like that okay the place we're going to want to inject the adrenaline is in the muscle on the side of our leg because there aren't any big blood vessels there and it's a good place for it to work and it's half way down your thigh and half way around so not right around here not at the top but halfway around there so 45 degree angle so what we do is we hold in a fist and we put the EpiPen in position then there's a great safety catch on the top and we take the safety catch off now it's like a safety catch on the gun now this can fire but we've got it in the right position already to go then it's a little swing so watch and listen carefully you'll hear it click when it when it hits my leg when it goes in then I need to count slowly up to ten now some people to make it easier to slow down add something like elephant so we might say 1 elephant 2 elephants 3 elephants all the way up to 10 and then in the real device there would be a little needle here and you would need to bend it over so it doesn't hurt anyone and puts it carefully away that would have injected adrenaline into this muscle and that would help all those things we talked about okay so I'm going to show you just so the whole sequence again to remind you so first of all we hold in a fist and we leave a gap then we take the safety catch off and then the swing right up to ten and then remove it okay now does that quite clear you understand yeah now this is quite important because if we do it wrong we can get into trouble I'm going to show you how not to do it now this is what you should not do so I'm going to pretend I'm very anxious and I haven't been practicing properly and I don't know what to do so I'm just going to pretend that's happening okay here we go what have I done I've injected my own thumb now that's really serious isn't it and actually that's very bad news because if we were to do that adrenaline in the end of my thumb we'll really switch off the blood supply and there's a risk the end of my thumb could actually die so he careful about this now mom I'm just going to explain to you if you were given the EpiPen how it would happen so I've shown you on myself now I'm going to pretend I'm dad and I'm giving it to Oliver yeah so now all it was not breathing difficult so I have him sitting down and it's really important that he does not stand up at all if somebody stands up during an anaphylactic reaction their blood pressure can fall very suddenly so normally if I stand up my body can control things and my blood pressure doesn't drop but if I'm having anaphylaxis and I'm having trouble breathing and I'm having an anaphylactic reaction and I stand up I will collapse and it can be very said so you must be either sitting down if you have a breathing problem or lining down if you're feeling faint in which case it's good to have the legs elevated so let's pretend he's having a reaction and he's got some breathing difficulty and I'm daddy and I'm going to give him his EpiPen so it's the same approach hold the EpiPen in a fist and hold it over the outer aspect of his thigh so on this side on the outside of the thigh same position half way down half way around hold it in position leave a gap take the safety catch off the only thing that's different is we just stabilize his legs so his leg doesn't jump away 1 2 3 all the way up to 10 and then remove the EpiPen the reason we need to hold it in position is because it does take a little while for the Mason to go into the muscle which is what we need what we don't want to do is this if we were to jump so we went in and jump and the needle came out again then it won't have time to go in properly somewhere",

        "video_sub_title": "how to recognize preeclampsia preeclampsia is a dangerous medical condition that appears in between 5% and 8% of all pregnant women typically after the 20th week women with preeclampsia developed high blood pressure and high protein levels in their urine which if allowed to progress can cause the potentially fatal seizures and strokes associated with full-blown eclampsia the key symptoms of preeclampsia high blood pressure and protein in the urine can usually be detected only at the doctor's office to avoid serious complications though it's vital to recognize the other signs of preeclampsia as early as possible and seek help immediately start with step 1 to increase the likelihood of early detection recognizing the symptoms of preeclampsia watch for excessive swelling one of the most common symptoms of preeclampsia is swelling also called edema especially in the hands feet legs and face it can be difficult especially in mild cases to distinguish the swelling associated with preeclampsia from the normal swelling experienced by many pregnant women but call your doctor if the swelling begins suddenly seems severe or is located in the hands or face as opposed to the feet or legs where normal swelling often takes place WH dot performance mark step 1 underscore rendered note any headaches women with preeclampsia often experience persistent headaches which may feel either dull inconstant or severe and throbbing occasional headaches are no cause for alarm but if your headache won't go away even after you've tried over-the-counter pain relievers or if it is extremely painful or accompanied by other symptoms such as swelling or visual disturbances see your doctor immediately monitor your weight weight gain is a normal necessary part of pregnancy but sudden weight gain of more than a few pounds in a week can be a sign of preeclampsia discuss your weight gain regularly with your doctor and call for an appointment if you see a sudden gain especially if you have any other symptoms pay attention to abdominal pain pregnant women often experience heartburn and indigestion and these are not generally signs of preeclampsia but if you have severe upper abdominal pain especially if it radiates to your back or shoulder seek medical care immediately don't dismiss nausea and vomiting although queasiness and vomiting are associated with normal first trimester morning sickness a sudden onset of these symptoms later in your pregnancy might be a cause for concern factor in back pain like many of the other symptoms back pain is common during pregnancy and does not necessarily indicate a problem all by itself however if you have severe lower back pain it could be the result of a problem with your liver something that can happen with preeclampsia see your doctor especially if you have other symptoms be aware of increased anxiety women who develop preeclampsia sometimes notice increased symptoms of anxiety they may feel panicky experience shortness of breath or notice a racing pulse if you notice mild versions of these symptoms or have a general sense that something might be wrong speak to your doctor at your next appointment but if these symptoms are severe or appear alongside other signs of preeclampsia that help right away according to the preeclampsia foundation many women who develop preeclampsia report that they have felt an intuitive sense that something was very wrong you may have feelings of anxiety or a sense that something is going wrong with your pregnancy even if everything is fine but trust your instincts and call your doctor anyway some women worry about annoying their doctors or seeming high-maintenance but it's better to be safe than sorry seek immediate help for visual disturbances some women with preeclampsia experienced blurred vision light sensitivity vision loss and other visual disturbances these symptoms can be very serious so if you notice them call your doctor immediately or go directly to an emergency room",

        "video_sub_title": "hi guys need a shout-out alright so I'm just letting this video real quick I'll try to make it quick um do it I could ask the question a lot on my hair straightening video that I did like a long time ago I get a lot of comments asking how I keep my hair straight after I string it out or like keep it from getting frizzy and all that and I don't you hide I'll just make a video real quick just showing you are telling you what I do so basically um so basically this is pretty much what I use that keeps my hair this is what works for me olive oil extra virgin olive oil and I put it in a spray bottle because it's just easier to use for my hair and spray bottle and then that Fangtasia I see hair polisher and stuff can get anywhere at Sally's or I got this at home actually I got this one at family dollars they had a mom it's really a small bottle I remember how much it was like a dollar or something so they fill it up Walmart or whatever and you know to buy olive oil at the grocery store and I'm but basically this is what I mainly use when I'm trying to keep my hair straight and it's basically all I use are these two products just olive oil and the hair polisher is like a serum but they both pretty much work good with keeping your hair straight shiny and it's getting frizzy so usually what I do is what I'm trying to keep my hair straightened at night I'll wrap it and usually like when I'll wrap it I'll put like a little bit of the olive oil in it and probably like keeping a little bit of this hair but I only mean like a little bit like you really it doesn't take a lot like I spray like one squirt of olive oil on my palms and run that through my hair maybe and then like a little tiny drop of this you know rub that all throughout my hair and yeah you the baton started when I wrap it right go to sleep by placing the status card and in the morning when I take it down I brush it down my hair still you know it's still perfectly straight and shiny it's it feels really and then maybe like before I you know what I'm styling my hair I might just maybe just use a little bit more of the disciplic you know might not only need to but sometimes I might just add a little bit for a little other little drop of this in my hair than that thing that's really all I do I don't even need a flatiron it or anything perfectly straight and um yeah perfectly straight I don't need a flatiron it again and the only things I might use the flat iron on is my baby because I want to style my babies and like curl them a little bit or whatever but that's actually the only thing and I mean are like if I wanted to like curl the ends of my hair under like if I don't want you to like splattered aren't it straightens okehazama T's it's not ready at all and yeah so that's pretty much what I doing it and it looks good because I even went the day but the humid wet rainy day out I like them I put if it's a rainy wet humid day I might put like a couple drops of each of these in my hair just because I'm really afraid of it getting pretty but it works for me I have when out during the day while it was wet raining out usually I put my hoodie on wherever I'm gonna be outside but I might not be outside that much of course if it is actually rings but if I when I am outside like walking from my house to the car or from the car store or whatever across our parking lot whatever I usually just because a lot of times I might wear on film I put my lid on but though like the air is moist and wet and yeah that can you can turn it frizzy but usually is this basically just what I use and it keeps it from getting frizzy so does every night wrap it you know you know you're gonna wear it down and straight than I could say I you know I would recommend wrapping it and put in a little bit over here of the room with this is what I use for a hair polisher and a little bit of extra virgin olive oil just wrap it the next day is pretty much because we just brush it down smell strange shiny and you know humid for the day just using these pretty much film I heard I had this print up so I'm just telling you that's what I do so I know works for me for my hair so olive oil and this I speed polisher wrap it at night and put a little bit of this and take it down the next day maybe another drop it in and that but yeah anyways so I hope that helped and oh yeah I hope that helped and that's it I'll see you in my next video like a yeah if you're not subscribed to me please subscribe to me and yeah I'll see you next time bye",

        "video_sub_title": "hi there folks andrea cox here with andre cox.com i am so glad you're here right now because we are in my kitchen and i have got a quick recipe for you and of course in true  style of a quick story for you so last saturday i was eating at my favorite raw vegan restaurant i'm not going to say the name because what i'm going to say after that will i'm not going to say the name but it's in orange county it's my all-time favorite restaurant and i love it and i love the food there but whenever i eat there because i've been a raw vegan for so long so many years i always feel like the food is a bit too dense for me so uh we were eating and i was eating all these dense things and this big salad with a salty dressing and and a salty soup that had i think namashoyu in it and i felt like i was getting a little inflamed and then i reached over and took a bite of my fian of my um my friend's food and in his food it was just two simple ingredients blended which i'm going to show you today and it was the best thing i'd had all night why because it was so clean and so simple and that's how my body responds well that's that's how i respond and now today you know it's been a few days since we went together and i had the leftover food from this raw vegan restaurant and i got to tell you i'm still feeling sluggish i'm still feeling weighed down and a little puffy days later but the lesson here is is to feed your body as simply as possible so getting to the recipe uh the food i tasted at this raw vegan restaurant was actually a garnish on my friend's plate and i just fell in love with it it was so good and it was broccoli and carrots that were blended in a food processor chopped very fine and i thought wow that would be so good to stuff in a nori wrap with avocado or to add a few medjool dates in and put it on top of a salad so we're not going to use carrots today because i don't have any carrots we're going to use beets which are stellar for a woman's bowels the top of this amazing i wish we had smell-o-vision here this amazing broccoli and we're going to save the stem for juicing tomorrow morning and for the salt we're going to use i'm highly salt sensitive so i don't like any salt except in my sauerkraut because i see it for days on my face for the salt we're going to use celery so this is so simple i mean raw food is not difficult and i'm going to show you two versions i'm going to show you an 80 10 10 version of this recipe which is a high fruit low fat version and then i'm going to show you the kind of a fatty raw recipe so what i'm going to do here is i'm going to take just half a stem of celery i'm not even going to use a knife i'm going to boom done so we're going to stick that in there i'm going to just take the top of the broccoli i'm hoping they can get all this i'm actually going to chop it a little bit people always email me when they watch my videos and see me cut like this they're like girl you better be careful hey i went to the cox culinary school of if you cut yourself you grab a band-aid and then i'm going to use just half of this beat in here love that look at that look at that beautiful red color that is a liver cleanser a blood cleanser throw it in there i told you this is really tough really tough i hope you grabbed a pen i always struggle with getting this shut i think it was my okay was my old roommate's job to get this to work for me every every day he'd come down and i always do the vitamix dance and this is the food processor dance we have to have like a a different one for the food little john travolta in there probably don't want to use john travolta's name right now because he's not exactly doing great okay so what i'm going to do i mean look at this this looks like christmas that looks like christmas what i'm gonna do is if i was wanting a fatty meal which i haven't decided what i want tonight and i never do until i get home from yoga or whatever i would put a little avocado in there and possibly roll it up in a nori wrap which i'm going to demonstrate from you for you you could just put a little avocado there and just just eat it like that or if i was 80 10 10 in it i would toss a couple of bahar barhi or medjool dates in there and put it on my salad so it's just so freakin simple um i would also you could take maybe a raw vegan chip and and place them on a little plate like that the little avocado on there i mean that is so i'm not even going to mess with the nori wrap you could do that and whether it had dates or avocado in there it'd be it would be a delicious and you have the salt from the celery the sweet from the beet or the dates if you choose to put dates in there the fatty from an avocado and it's just a wonderful wonderful way to enjoy more vegetables this would be great for kids so andre cox here just wanted to show you a quick recipe and if you like this video hey hit the like button and post your favorite way to get more vegetables in your",

        "video_sub_title": "hey guys so I finally got around to doing a cutaway nail design tutorial now because almost every design on my nails are different from each other this is going to be a long video so I'm going to get right to it you're going to start off like always with a base coat of your choice and then right after you're going to use a black nail striper if you don't have nail striper you can use use a black nail polish with a very thin paintbrush or a toothpick so the pinky is probably going to be one of the more easier two signs you're basically just going to do an upside-down V or a right-side up triangle on your nail and of course you don't have to use a tape but I just really like the clean-cut edge that the tape provides now for the cross on your ring finger you're going to do two parallel lines running down the middle of your nail and then two parallel line little lines going across your nail and like a lowercase T formation and then just fill in the corners of your design and of course you don't need to use tape but to be honest I'm just very messy and I cannot get a very clean cut cross without them it's just not possible for me you can get these tapes on eBay if you're looking for the same results they're super cheap they come in a bundle of 10 for like less than two dollars really cheap guys but anyways after that you just finish off by tapering the ends of your cross so for my middle finger I decide to go with a chevron design so I basically had two separate tapes come together and end in a point or a v-formation and then just fill out the spaces in between so as you can see there are a little slivers of tape that are going to be inside the design but I was just too lazy to correct this so what I decided to do instead was after I finished removing the tape I was just going to fill it in by free drawing it and because most of the shape is already done for you it's pretty easy to just fill in the V at the end so this design was mostly improvised but what I should have done was have four rows of tapes going down the nail instead of just three so if you made this a mistake no problem just add the last Chevron slip at the very end of your nail and then for your pointer finger you're just going to have two rows of parallel tape going to horizontally across your nail so leaving a gap right in the middle where you are done with the use of a tape make sure to remove it immediately the last thing you want is having your nail-polish dry if you let your nail polish dry before you remove the tape your tape is going to peel off the nail polish and it's just really annoying to start over so make sure you work fast and remove the tape as soon as you're done using it okay so finally we're on the thumb again another improvised design I basically just had a very skinny X go right down the center of my nail and just paint it on the sides of it another pro tip make sure you remember which table what goes on top so you don't run into this problem that I'm having right here if you do you can always clean it up try to do this as quickly as possible before the nail polish dries and then you can just correct your mistake and then finally just clean up with a cotton swab dipped in nail polish remover to make sure that your design looks super clean and now finally we're moving on to our right hand so our pointer finger and our ring finger designs are going to be the same just swapped places and our middle finger is going to be different instead of the chevron design we are going to have three parallel lines going down the nail and the way I created this was by having two pairs of tape going down on each side of our nail making sure that there's an equal amount of space between the two tapes on either side so that we have a very symmetrical looking design so another little tip make sure that when you're using the tape that you press down on your nail so that you have no air bubbles because my middle stripe had an air bubble and if this happens to you it can always be easily fixed with a cotton swab dipped in nail polish remover like I'm doing right now so for my pinky I was too lazy to you striping tape so I just decided to freehand draw a V so for the last nail design I just had the tapes go across in an ex formation and then filled in the gaps at the top and bottom and finally finish off with a quick dry top coat and that's it guys you're done so this is definitely my longest tutorial by far that I've ever done that I'm a really big fan of the mix-and-match nail design so let me know if you guys want me to do more of these and as always thank you guys so much for the lovely comments that I receive and please don't forget to subscribe and like this video and I'll see you guys in the next one bye",

        "video_sub_title": "now I decided that its fourth of July and I want to do some half chickens today and I'm going to do them on my ugly drum smoker and I've been meaning to get a video put together for a while now that's basically showing you how to start a fire in a UDS specifically one of the ugly drum smokers that I've built what I do is I've got my ugly drum here you know and I got it I've used it quite a bit so it's a little bit cleaned out here you know and that's the big way then I got my cooking grate there got my charcoal basket and I got my diffuser plate I always put a diffuser plate in them I found that it really does help a lot to do that as far as maintaining temps then I've got a Weber charcoal chimney this is the big one that you can get at Lowe's and this is some peach wood that I've cut up into little chunks that if you're on our forums Rick from our forums at smoker builder comm forums him and I did a wood trade and he hooked me up with some peach and these are interesting little deals always used to use newspaper you know but and I also use my charcoal my fish fryer burner as well but these things here have been pretty handy at competitions basically it's made by Weber made by Weber and they're just little wax cubes just like this is for starting your chimney you know but if you dump it out there it's just a little cube and like an ice cube and I take and put two of them like that you get another one out here you don't ever want to use lighter fluid on these things it's just not real barbecue if you're using lighter fluid you're not doing it right so I put them two deals on there like that and then I got this charcoal chimney and you can see those little cubes sit underneath of there like that I'm going to fill this thing up with charcoal here in a second and like those two cubes on fire stand by okayed I filled up this charcoal chimney full of charcoal I'm using a little bit of Kingsford in the back there that I had leftover from uh some up from another cook but I got this bag of they normally don't have Royal Oak briquettes in our area so I went ahead and got that bag and I like using them better and there's my two ice cubes you can see they've got some charcoal dust on them from when I dumped it these things are awesome because they like seriously catch on fire like right away if you can see that there and then you just stand this chimney right there over top of them you can I don't know if you can see that because of the light the lighting but you can see that it's already starting to burn good thing about the good thing about these little cubes is they don't leave any flavor on the on the charcoal you know we've got some black smoke happening right now but that's mainly the charcoal getting started down there the dust but so hearing a little bit whenever that charcoals turns a certain salt and pepper we're going to dump it in the inside of our basket here but in the basket now I do this thing I don't know if it's the trick the original minyan method but I call it that basically I'm going to fill that basket with a bunch of charcoal and I like this lump that frontier makes it's the if you get it down by Joplin I think they're using some pecan in that because I get a real good pecan kind of odor from it you can smell it in there burning but anyway I'm going to mix that with Royal Oak lump and what happens is is if you just use the frontier straight like that it'll ash up real bad and kind of block off your air from your fire so if you mix lump with the Royal Oak briquettes you still get the benefits of lump but you know but it's not going to ash up as bad because you're using a lot of roll oak in there too so I'm going to fill that basket up real quick I'll be right back I wanted to show you how I do this how I fill this up when I'm using two different kinds I kind of layer it I put a layer of that in there and then I put it later this lump in there on top of that so there's the first layer of Royal of briquettes okay there's a I just put some lump in there on top of the briquettes now I'm going to finish it off with some more love the person more briquettes and then the rest of the lump that I've got okay so there you have it I've got lump and briquettes mixed in there and then what I do with that chimney whenever it's ready to go I just basically make a well some guys poured off to one side I like to make a well in the middle here DC man the plumber on our web site on the smoker builder comm forums he likes to use a coffee can in the middle that's a really good way of doing it but I don't have any metal coffee cans here so I don't drink that canned coffee stuff is bad for you anyway so it's like making mashed potatoes and gravy here get your spot going I like to make that spot in the middle where I can see plumb through the bottom of it there like that so we're going to let this chimney get done here and then I'll show you how I pour that in there okay we're starting to get the salt and pepper to look happening there smartest thing at this point is to put on a dang glove well the gloves work pretty good bear with me okay and you always want to have something with a hook on it available for letting that basket down in the drum because the thing the barrel itself is like a charcoal chimney once you start lowering that basket in there all the heats going to be coming right up on your arm so you want to make sure and have a long hook crowbar works the best but I forgot mine of course so we take our chimney and we dump it right down into keep your head and hands and stuff out from the weight of the top of that chimney and you just dump that thing down in there like that set your chimney back up on top of the great because it'll still burn your concrete and then I've got my peach wood chunks here I just kind of sprinkle a few you don't want to put a whole lot of wood in there because you know if you put a lot of wood in there you're not going to get blue smoke you're going to get a whole lot of wet white smoke because you're not putting a whole lot of air in there but anyway here I grab my basket like this I might to set you down for a minute while I do that guys some bucks heavy so bear with me okay I just set my basket down in there now I'm going to grab this back diffuser and I've got like an arrow on here because I've got to sit this in there a certain direction that's how I remember where to put it okay my diffusers in there and I didn't clean my great yet right on my stick him in there anyway clean drum makes the best barbecue so there we go I've still got all my area in let's shut on the bottom here and that's just to help discourage the smoke and the heat from coming way up online my hands so bad so I open up my chart my chimp my exhaust and I take all these caps off here so now we're getting air in there on the fire and then last thing is I opened my ball valve and we just watch the temperature go up and you can see it's hot it's already up to 200 ish these thermometers are highly inaccurate and I did take a minute ago and kind of wrenched around on it just a little bit and I got it calibrated sort of so what I do is I showed you a minute ago I open all the I open all the caps on the bottom and I open the ball valve and what happened was is this thing shot up to like 250 really fast and so whenever that thing gets up around 250 you want to put all the caps back on it and just leave the ball valve open and what you'll do then is just kind of watch your thermometer well this thing's been running right between 225 and 250 now for about 30 or 45 minutes now and the thing about these drums these drum smoker's is once you get that temperature where you want it you want to be patient because every single adjustment you make it's going to take about thirty minutes for that thing to straighten itself out it's going to shoot up or shoot way down in temperature depending on if you opened or closed the valve and then it just takes a while for it to equalize back out well I mean this thing's holding dead on you know 225 ish or so and anyway it's it's running pretty good so I do use a digital inside my drum I use a maverick 87 32 is what I use because it's got a remote with it and I can take the remote inside with me and the drum will sit out here and do its thing and I can watch it from inside and if the temperature gets out of control little send off an alarm and tell me I'll put that in here whenever I put the meat on another thing that happens all the time is you know like on these drum smokers you'll be out outside in the wind and depending on the direction of the wind blowing the wind is actually coming from that way right now kind of over by the garage it's whipping around in between my truck and the garage door here and so I've got the ball valve open but it's it's facing the direction the wind is blowing so but then on the other side I'm not going to open that cab because the wind's blowing directly into it and so that'll actually act like a is if you had a fan blowing on that fire down there and it'll cause your drum to get out of control another thing is when the wind is blowing across the top of your drum like on this pipe nipple there it causes like a soda bottle effect like whenever you blow across the soda bottle and it makes that noise it's actually pulling a vacuum on the drum and so you can make a you can go get a high wind cap like for a for water heater vent or for a furnace vent or something or you can just take your chimney and just set it down right on top of it like that and that chimney whenever the air blows across the top of the chimney it's going to tend to draw air in through these holes on the bottom of it which is going to cause it to cause a draft right there and it won't be a high wind draft it will just be a normal draft so that'll kind of help keep your drum under control the more the running these smoker these drum smokers is all about air control and so the more air in the drum or moving through the drum the hotter that fire is going to be so we just try our best to keep everything tight keep your lid down keep it sealed real good don't take it off unless you have to and anyway a little bit I'm gonna put some meat on here we're going to have some thanks for watching you",

Chauhan in the short video I'm gonna answer a question that's asked a lot and that is I have fatigue irritability forgetfulness lack of motivation lack of desire low libido what's going on I feel like a brain fog I feel like my brains inflamed and the answer is yes it is how well when the body's inflamed okay with the body has receptors which delineate pain okay the brain we don't have these these receptors in our brain that says hey I'm on fire I'm in pain so how does the brain react to any type of inflammation you asked good question it decreases the mental cognition which is basically the mental function also - it leads into hormonal imbalances the main hormones that the brain loves is serotonin calms you down dopamine revs you up and cortisol which is which is for inflammation so when your brain is inflamed it's gonna zap zap all that why do you not experience it again because we don't have receptors in our brain that'd be too easy so what are the symptoms again i just-i symptoms could be low energy irritability irritability because of lack of serotonin insomnia our body repairs itself when we're sleeping due to the rest digest and repair the parasympathetic division of the nervous system low motivation you don't feel like doing anything the dopamine zapped headaches anxiety confusion trouble concentrating I teach and I see a lot of my students have trouble concentrating you don't think that's due to brain inflammation now how I always say this it'd be a lot easier to fall off the bus daaad be very very simple but how's it happened because high levels of inflammatory molecules called adipocyte Oh kinds and histamines what happens it stimulates microglia activation what is my cochlea you ask good question that's the immune response in our brain so those microglial cells get inflamed and then that is what causes all the Cascade lack of sleep okay when we sleep our body goes into what's called the parasympathetic division dominance which again that's our repair system and we're not sleeping correctly again we're going to have we're not going to we're not gonna be able to focus nutritional deficiencies there's a lot of things again a brain or brain wants nutrition ooh trician proper nutrition to function poor diet sugar causes information all over alcohol refined carbs yes that will cause systemic inflammation hormonal imbalances like serotonin dopamine cortisol all those hormonal imbalances will lead to brain information if you have lead to brain inflammation Alita decline in cognitive function now again the question is what do you do well first and foremost you monthly per diet I always say diet is key get rid of the sugar get rid of refined carbs increase the lean proteins and dietary fats our bodies run on two things that's lean proteins and essential fats we need proteins for the amino acids to help build up tissue and we need the dietary fats for cellular function our brain is 80% fat as is so we do need dietary fats for proper brain function this is not hose okay this is like avocados Omega fish oils things like that stress management stress management cortisol will burn out the brain in a heartbeat actually it increased cortisol is proven that actually causes brain shrinkage sleep we need sleep for repair exercise exercise in of itself is a plethora of benefits one it helps reduce the heart I mean getting controls heart rate and it makes us cells more insulin sensitive less insulin resistance it's good for the brain because all those neurons are stimulating brain growth comprehensive blood panel again if you really want us to figure out what's going on your body I'm a functional medicine practitioner okay I require in order for me to work my patients is a comprehensive comprehensive blood panel what is that I want to see the CBC the chem I want see everything that's in that blood panel so I could have a starting block of how to treat my patients also maybe food allergies do you have food allergies which is causing a histamine response okay and all these implement ory markers which is stimulating the activating the microglia microglia activation which is causing brain fog so what do you do again with the diet supplements supplements adaptogens there's a brand of herb called adaptogens these will help make your body adapt to stress by controlling cortisol holy basil maca aqua ganda I get my patients on a lot of ashwagandha if they don't have thyroid problems okay that's one thing you have to know for omega-3 omega-3 fish oil omega-3 fish oil has two important ingredients in there EPA and DHA one is good for the body what the other ones good for the brain vitamin b-complex the B vitamins okay are essential for the nervous system tumeric tumeric is a natural anti-inflammatory and organic green tea okay hope this helps again reduce brain inflammation why it occurs what can we do about it hope you enjoy the video hit the like button down below leave a comment leave a question and I'll see you the next one thank you very much",

        "video_sub_title": "[Music] hey guys it's welcome back to my channel today we're gonna be doing another video on anosmia but this one is gonna be a little bit different and geared in a different direction so if that sounds interesting to you or if you stumbled across this or somebody sent it to you stick around because there's gonna be some good information in this video hopefully to start out if you have watched any of my videos I've talked about it a lot I have a couple of videos specifically about it that I'll link down below but I have congenital nas Mia which means I was born without the ability to smell anatomy it just means the loss of smell either permanently or temporarily and I permanently have lost it first unless I had like a stem-cell thing done it's not coming back so why is that relevant to this video I'm going to tell you basically there's been a lot of articles coming out about how koban 19 or the corona virus is affecting the sense of smell of people and either making them temporarily and asmik or permanently in asmik in some cases or they think permanently obviously it's too early to tell how permanent it's going to be but a NAS make for a long period of time which is making a lot of people new to anosmia and this kind of thing I don't know if that makes sense anyway if you or a family member or a friend has lost their sense of smell as just a symptom there'll be stuff in this video for you if it's more permanent now this video is for you yeah or if you know anybody send it to them so in this video will be some tips for people that are a NAS make just in general or new to anosmia because of this virus and then also some positives to it because I want to make people feel like they're not alone and that there are some good things about being able to smell so I wanted to throw some of those in there so you see me looking across it's because I wrote my tips down so I didn't forget any and I'm sure there's more if you have any if you want to put those in the comments go ahead the first thing is to learn to be okay asking people to smell something for you so this could be like if you don't know if a shirt was washed or not and you need somebody to like smell it really quick to know if it's okay to wear or like I can't go shopping for like perfumes or stuff like candles without my sister or somebody with me anybody really and I have to be like hey can you smell these and sometimes my sister's like Oh cause I'm making her smell like the ninth candle and her nose is probably like so overwhelmed but I don't I don't want to get a bad smelling candle and like light it and have somebody come over I'd be like that candle isn't smell good so I'm learning to be okay asking people to smell something for you it helps obviously if they know that you can't smell so they're not like why but it's okay to ask they have something that is really beneficial in some cases and sometimes you do need to know what something smells like so don't be afraid to ask a family member that's around or a friend if you really get really comfortable with it even asking a stranger like hey can you do this with for me just learning to be okay with that because you should be okay it's not your fault you know the next thing is try to pick sense when you're buying things that either you remember if you're somebody that has lost their sense of smell or something that you know or have heard people like that's like a common scent that people enjoy or just sticking to like neutral fresh scents someplace something that's like clean linen or like fresh cotton I go for like though sense because I know that it's gonna be more of a neutral smell and because I can't smell it I don't want to like overwhelm other people the scent that's like super super strong so I go for things that like the label says because that's all I can do really is more like a neutral just clean and fresh scent versus like mango passionfruit tropical vacation cuz I I don't know what that smells like and maybe people don't like it so I try to pick a neutral cents another thing this is super super important is to check your smoke detectors that they're working more often than the average person because you can't smell that can obviously affect not being able to smell smoke so I know for me I don't know if there's smoke until I see it or I taste it where most people would probably smell it first and from farther away so I can't taste it til it gets close enough to me that makes sense so making sure that your smoke detectors are working and if you have like gas detectors things like that making sure that those are intact because there have been times we have a gas stove that I've turned it on and the flame has it ignited and gas has just been coming out I had no idea because I can't smell gas so those are super important things and just like pretty critical things that you should just be aware of and making sure that you are checking those things regularly and more often than they probably suggest and then also don't leave anything unattended if you're cooking even if something using a microwave like don't walk away from it but don't do that anyway but especially if you can't smell because if you're in another room and it something starts on fire you might not know until you get back into that room and can see it or taste it so don't leave anything I attended if you're cooking or make sure somebody is there and then my last tip is to let your co-workers managers roommates especially people that are going to be around you a lot know because that's super important I know I work at a childcare center and so one of the things I meant I work with the infants and so I said they go to the bathroom and I can't smell when they do so if a co-worker is like oh well you you know check and see if some so I went to the bathroom I can't do that and so it makes it hard that I have to be like oh actually I keep so I just let everybody know sometimes people forget and that's totally fine I'll just be like oh yeah I can I'll go take them into the bathroom and then I like I'll just change them anyway but especially if you're working like at a restaurant or somewhere where there's like cooking and things like that it's nice for people to know and they probably will forget it happens all the time my family forgets sometimes it happens but just so that they know and that they're aware and that they can be on the lookout for you or like let you know if something smells you know just let those people know and then roommates especially too just because they're spending time with you and so if you're in the kitchen and you walk away and you know it's just making sure that people that are around you know and if you have to remind them that's okay it's hard you it's something you can't see you don't it's not visible that it's something that we can't do so it's okay if you have to remind people so now I want to quickly touch on some of the positives that I've found over 21 years of not being able to smell so the first thing is that you can go to the bathroom after anybody's used it you know some people are like oh don't go in there for a little bit I you know you can cuz you can't smell it so it doesn't matter same thing goes with like porta potties makes it so much less gross for me like I still like you know but because I can't smell it it takes away that whole like nasty smell aspect and it's just like it's not as nice as a bathroom but it makes it a lot easier to go in those if you have any pets picking up their you know poop or like having a cat cat litter stuff like that can't smell that you can't smell people's bad breath that's like a huge turnoff for some people like in friends significant others anything not a turn-off for you because you can't smell it and then lastly it's something that makes you different it's a conversation starter yeah it's just something that people find usually fascinating and they have a lot of questions about it so if you're open to talking about it it can be a great little conversation starter between people and also can lead you to finding other people that have it creating a little community I know I have a couple like Facebook groups that I'm in for people that have congenital NAS Mia and it's just fun to see like their experiences and what they're you know I found out that they're creating diapers that like have an alarm system to let you know when they're wet like on your phone somehow so that like parents I can't smell knowing their kids have gone to the bathroom found out about that because somebody shared an article in that group so you find really cool people and other information through those people so I think that's cool yeah that's about all I have for this video but I just wanted to come on as I was reading more and more articles about the possibility of like permanent anosmia and then just that one of the symptoms is loss of smells so just wanted to come on here and let people know that it's not the end of the world obviously there are a lot of negatives to it but there are some positives and I wanted to share some tips to just that you felt I don't know I just wanted to share some of my knowledge so like I said if you want to know more about what congenital nas mia is again that's being born with it so it's a little different than like losing it to an injury or a virus but I'll leave that video down below and then I also have a couple blind taste tests that I've done where I am blindfolded and then my mom gives me food and I try to guess it and I do a really bad job because I can taste but when I can't see it it's really hard for me to know a lot of my taste is based on memory I explained it in the video so I don't want this to get too long and to go into that but I will leave those link down below as well if you guys want more videos on not being able to smell and things like that or resources let me know down below and yeah thank you guys so much for watching make sure to comment like and subscribe because why not why wouldn't you and I will see you in my next video bye you [Music]",

        "video_sub_title": "hi I'm dr. Neal Schultz host of dermtv creator and founder of beauty rx skincare and today we're in my New York City office and I'm going to tell you how to get rid of facial warts but before I do that let me tell you a little bit about facial warts first of all all warts whether on your face or on your foot or anyplace else they're all caused by the HPV virus now you're accustomed to warts on your hands where they look or on your fingers where they look like little round things with little frogs or little sticks sticking up that's part of the papillomas of human papilloma virus but when you get warts on your face they're flat warts they're really very different they are not raised very high they're almost a little bit of the shape of my hand meaning they have a very small thickness but they're much larger in area than they have thickness so it almost looks like these little stuck on little buds on your skin they can be anywhere from a 64th of an inch to a sixteenth of an inch but usually they're very small now if you want to try at home remedies anything that helps to dissolve dead skin anything that's keratolytic or anything that's an exfoliant will help so acne preparations that have 2% salicylic acid in them well that'll help most of the products that are used for plantar warts on your feet are based on salicylic acid but those would be much too strong to use on your delicate facial skin other chemical exfoliants like retinoids ran a retinol tretinoin these have all been used but of course the retinoids are all by prescription and retinol just isn't strong enough the over-the-counter retinol well next we have my favorite chemical exfoliant which i think is the gold standard of chemical exfoliant glycolic acid and glycolic acid can be purchased over the counter eight percent 10 percent 12 percent and you can try using that on the warts on a daily basis or twice a day but when you get to the point where the warts aren't going away because warts really don't play by the usual rules of engagement for an infection when you get to the point where the warts aren't going away and you decide it's time to see your dermatologist I as the dermatologist usually remove facial warts with an instrument called a curette which is actually like a curved spoon and you can see the curve here and I'm just going to open this up for you and give you an idea what this curved spoon looks like now this curette is much too large for facial warts but I just took this one out to give you an example so you could actually see it but the one that I actually use the facial warts is this size and it actually is only about a millimeter and a half and I use this as a spoon to sort of scoop them off the surface of the skin would that be painful a little bit so we use local anesthesia or we even have these topical anesthetics now like my cream and other creams that you could put just on the surface of the skin without any injections without any needles and then you just have to I just have to scoop these all off because these types of warts don't have roots there usually is no mark when it heals and there usually are no scars and I'm sorry to tell you that most of those home remedies for flat warts and for that matter for most other words don't work very well so if you have flat warts on your face make sure you see a dermatologist to get them removed before they spread especially if you're a guy because guys when they shave they spread the warts all over the place with their razor and that becomes a disaster for women who don't shave and I hope you don't for women who don't shave you can use the at home remedies a little bit longer but guys you really need to get them taken care of quickly so if you have facial warts you can try at home remedies but you're probably going to wind up seeing your dermatologist so go sooner than later before they spread and that's the scoop on how to get rid of facial wart I'm dr. Neal Schultz and thanks for watching today you",

        "video_sub_title": "welcome to this week's installment of wellness weekly occasionally we have patients in our office who suffer injuries as a result of an incident at home at work or perhaps as a result of a sporting injury often they contact us and ask us in addition to a chiropractic adjustment how should they best manage their injury at home when applied correctly heat and ice can offer natural help to promote your recovery with any type of injury the application of either heat or eyes can decrease pain aid recovery and decrease healing time however if the incorrect procedure is used with the application of the wrong modality or incorrectly applying the correct modality it is possible to make the condition actually worse and cause long-term damage it is therefore very important to know when and how to apply each of these modalities as a rule of thumb apply only eyes to new injuries and apply only heat to older long-standing problems with an acute injury only use either real ice or high quality gel ice packs with one or two layers of cloth or paper towel to protect the bare skin for a maximum of 10 minutes and not more than once per hour here's what you can expect after you apply the ice during the first stage it will feel cold which will last about one to two minutes the second stage will involve a warmer sensation lasting about five minutes during the third stage you may feel pain perhaps lasting just a few seconds and the final and most important stage is numbness when the area is numb it means that you are controlling the swelling and slowing down the production of pain chemicals you are promoting faster healing and fewer adhesions and scar tissue keep the ice on for about two minutes after the numb stage is reached and then immediately remove it this usually happens right around eight to ten minutes the entire icing session should not exceed 15 minutes to exceed this time span places you at risk of bruising the tissues which may result in increased pain the next day with an old injury to increase blood circulation and improve flexibility after long-standing muscle stiffness you should use heat avoid applying any heat directly to the spine as increased blood circulation in the vicinity of delicate spinal nerve roots may worsen inflammation and naturally call our office immediately for an adjustment this will ensure your spine and nervous system is in the best possible condition to promote healing and make sure you follow our recommendation so you don't undo what we do during your office visits when in doubt please ask us",

increase your immune system so by following the methods outlined in this video it will help you raise your natural defenses against disease so white blood cells are an important part of the immune system these cells help fight infections by attacking viruses bacteria and germs that invade the body and white blood cells originate in the bone marrow that circulates throughout the bloodstream unfortunately many people are low in white blood cells because perhaps they have a nutrient deficiency hormone imbalances and also underlying health problems so in today's video we will look at 10 natural ways to help increase white blood cells within the body vegetables the best and most natural way to boost your white blood cell count is by consuming lots of vitamin c and plant-based nutrients now in particular cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli and kale are rich in vitamin c and other antioxidants all of which can help to boost the immune function and other really good sources of vitamin c are also sauerkraut which is basically a fermented cabbage and bell peppers zinc when it comes to boosting the immune system zinc is one of the most important minerals and it can really help to increase white blood cell levels so by increasing your zinc intake what it basically does it supports the thymus gland in growing t cells which are a type of white blood cell and these t cells they destroy infected cells in the body and therefore can help you heal faster from infection and to increase zinc levels the best natural source is a shellfish such as crab lobster and oysters and zinc can also be found in beef liver and seaweed apple cider vinegar apple cider vinegar has long been known as a powerful natural healer and basically it's a healthy acidic fluid made from fermented apples and can really help you maintain a strong and healthy immune system and apple cider vinegar can be consumed with water and it really helps to stimulate what are known as phagocytes in the body and these are white blood cells that basically hunt down and destroy microbes and bacteria and yeast and fungus and dead cells stress if you want to increase your white blood cell levels in order to improve your immune system then lowering your stress levels is really really important feeling stressed on a regular basis releases a hormone called cortisol which can significantly suppress and inhibit white blood cells so high stress levels can leave you more prone to catching cold and infection avocado avocados are a great healthy food and should form a regular part of most diets and they can really help to strengthen your immune system because they're loaded with healthy fats vitamin e and minerals and they're also an excellent source of glutathione the master antioxidant which helps detoxify and protects the human body oily fish oily fish should be consumed at least twice a week since they can help boost the health of your white blood cells and fish such as wild cork salmon sardines and mackerel are really excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids which are anti-inflammatory and are scientifically shown to strengthen certain types of white blood cells called b cells oregano oil oregano oils one of the most powerful natural immune boosters especially when it comes to fighting infections that attack the lungs and the respiratory system it contains natural compounds which can really help boost white blood cell levels as well as powerful antioxidants that have been proven to help fight cancer sugar sugar and refined foods can be quite harmful to the human body since they weaken the immune system by depleting nutrients in the body so consuming too much sugar makes the white blood cells less active which gives viruses and other invaders within the body more opportunity to create infections vitamin d now all white blood cells have vitamin d receptors because this nutrient helps to control and modulate the immune system and we get vitamin d when our sun becomes exposed to sunlight however many people in the world are actually vitamin d deficient so taking the daily supplement of vitamin d3 and k2 helps to grow new white blood cells in the thymus gland and vitamin k2 works with vitamin d in the body to destroy small calcium shells which many viruses hive within cod liver oil cod liver oil is one of the best supplements that you can take to boost your vitamin a intake and large amounts of vitamin a are needed by the lymphatic tissues where white blood cells are stored and this keeps your white blood cells kind of primed and ready to defend against infection and invaders so in summary there are many natural ways in which you can help increase your white blood cells within the body and therefore help to keep your immune system strong so we hope you found this information useful we have many similar videos being released shortly so please hit that subscribe button and turn on notifications and that

        "video_title": "How to Stop Trigger Finger CATCHING and POPPING (TRY THIS!)",
        "video_sub_title": "this little product can make a big impact on your finger if it is triggering so it comes in different sizes I have two sizes here with me they say the size on the back this one is a four and the this one is a seven so they come they go all the way up to like 14 so I'll put a link and then you'll want to make sure that you measure yourself so you know which size is right for you and the way that this helps with trigger finger is so say my middle finger is popping or clicking so this video isn't really about trigger finger or the signs and symptoms of it but if you know you have trigger finger or you know that your finger is touching or locking meaning like when you make a fist it has you have a hard time lifting it back up that's an indicator that you could possibly have a trigger finger you want to get a doctor to make that diagnosis for you but if your fingers really clicking or popping whenever you're making a fist or it's getting stuck that is a good sign that you could have a trigger finger that's an inflammation of your flexor tendon and your tendon goes through pulleys so there's a bunch of pulleys on your fingers that help hold the tendon down against the bone if you didn't have those our tendons would be popping away from the bone so sometimes though that swelling gets enlarged so the fluid around that tendon becomes bigger and it's like pulling a grape through a straw which is usually right down there because that's where people have the most pain and when you go to grasp it's like pulling that thickened area through something that's like this size meant for something that's like this size and that's why you've got popping or that clicking or that catching and then it it can stay down and then it's unable to get back through that pulley and that's when you have to like physically pull that up so say my ring finger is getting stuck down so you put the oval-8 splints or finger and you put it so that the round part is fitting over your joint and what happens is it keeps you from making a full fist so it still lets you bend hair at the tip which is important and it still lets you bend at the knuckle which is also important but it won't let you make the full fist which is what causes the trigger finger is when you bend at all three joints some trigger finger products or splints will go all the way down through the knuckle and actually block you from bending at the knuckle and they let you bend here and here I don't have one of those with me today but those are usually fine too but if you can keep this one or the one here from bending when you make a fist you should be able to eliminate that catching and in popping the goal is to make sure you avoid the catching or the popping some people think that if they grip a ball they can kind of grip the trigger finger right out of there but that's not the case and in fact that can make it worse so you want to avoid the clicking and popping and this ring can really help that so it still will let you use your hand for light activities because you still can't should be able to like hold an onion if you've got a cut you should still be able to do some laundry you should still be able to you know blow-dry your hair it's not going to fact your function as much as like a really big splint would now I will make note that this joint then is going to get a little stiff if you have it on all the time now you can take it off at night time as long as you notice when you're sleeping that you're not clenching your fists and when you're when you're sleeping because then when you wake up you may notice oh no it's it's back to where it was when you take the splint off if the joint feels very stiff what you can do is just do some gentle movements where you just are taking your other hand to gently bend that joint so it doesn't get very stiff so notice I'm just gently moving the joint with this hand I don't want to come all the way down and potentially have that start triggering or popping again and get more inflammation to that area if you want to try the oval-8 splints to help block that full motion to help get rid of trigger finger I think this could help you four to six weeks is gonna be about the amount of time that you'll need to get the inflammation out of that tendon and let that tendon rest before you start noticing a difference in your in your finger and hopefully that trigger finger has gone away I would slowly wean yourself out of that basically meaning take it off every once in a while for light activities if you need more assistance or you're looking for a more information on how to get rid of trigger finger or perhaps what you should do after a trigger finger surgery follow the link below we can show you exactly what you need to do online for preventing trigger finger for how to stop trigger finger or what to do if you trying everything and you still had to have trigger finger release we can help you thanks for

        "video_title": "Five Questions About Coronavirus (COVID-19)",
        "video_sub_title": "- Hi, I'm Dr. Hilary Babcock with BJC Healthcare and Washington University, and I'm here to answer a few questions about the new coronavirus. So, if you tested positive for a common coronavirus, then you should take the same kind of precautions that you would take after any cold or flu every year. So you should stay home while you're sick. You should rest up. You should drink lots of fluids, and avoid other people, but you don't need to be in a self-quarantine or self-isolation at home. So the new novel coronavirus, COVID-19, usually presents with similar symptoms to influenza, though often with a slower onset. So patients start to feel bad; they start having aches and pains. They develop a fever and cough, and those are the most common symptoms we've seen with the COVID-19 infection. So the best ways to keep you and your family safe from COVID-19 are to stay home, avoid large public gatherings, wash your hands frequently or use hand sanitizer, and if you yourself are ill with any infection even if you don't know what it is, it's best to stay home so that you don't put other people at risk. Another way that you can keep you and your family safe is to try to minimize your touching of other people. So instead of shaking hands and hugging when you run into old friends or business acquaintances, practice waving so that you don't have any contact and don't have any risk of passing  the virus between the two of you. BJC and Washington University have been working together for over a month to get all of our health care settings prepared to identify patients that might have coronavirus infection, to isolate them appropriately and to provide care safely to keep our healthcare workers and other patients safe. So I would definitely avoid travel to areas where we know there is a community outbreak of coronavirus. So that includes a lot of areas in Europe, a lot of areas in Asia, and certain areas in the United States. Because the situation is changing so quickly, we don't always know where there will be more community spread within a day or two or within the next week. If you are at high risk for complications, if you get a COVID-19 infection, so if you are over the age of 60 or 65, if you have underlying health conditions or are immunocompromised, it may be safer for you to avoid travel at this time.",

        "video_sub_title": "hey what's up everyone this is Joe welcome to another how to origami tutorial and today I will teach you how to fold the origami cup so this right here is probably the easiest origami tutorial I've ever done I'm getting this out to you guys because I don't know if you see my last one the origami boat I just thought you know it's really hot right now where I am in Portland Oregon's goals like you know what let's both keep it with a water theme so we had a boat and canoe to be specific now we're going to do a cup and you know it's really simple but you know what it's going to be helpful in the in the hot days sometimes you know you go to a party and leg up they don't have any Red Solo cups what am I going to do well if you have a piece of paper you're in luck you can make a cup so anyway let's go ahead and do that so what we're going to do to start is we're going to fold from corner to corner to make a diagonal this is a very popular well-known piece of origami so if you already know how to make this then no need to watch I'm sure most of you or some of you have made this in the past anyway so there's a nice nice diagonal crease right there okay so now I'm going to turn it like this and basically the goal is to fold this across here so that this remains perfectly horizontal so one way we can do that is we can take this corner down here see I'm pretending like I'm going to make a fold right here but really I'm just going to do what's called a mark fold mark fold I'm just going to press down right here do the same thing on the other side [Music] this mark fold here alright so now we have these two lines and this will give us a pretty rough estimate of where our horizontal line is and there we have it you can see or maybe you can't because I'm using yellow paper good job Joe smartly there is a line right here from where this folds over and that is pretty much pretty much horizontal all right so let's do that crease there all right we're going to do the same thing here and fold this over to that same point so these two should line up on the same line essentially just like that okay so now we have this our cup is right here okay so let's get these out of the way let's start by folding the top layer down over here like this okay flip it over and do the same thing on the backside all right yes so this right here is the complete traditional origami top but in this channel we like to make things as best as they can possibly be and what I'm going to do is improve this design just a little bit so if you want to end it here that's fine this is the complete version you're done but you notice that if you fill this up with water and you want to put it down it's not going to work out too well gravity just doesn't doesn't work that way so what we're going to do is we're going to press this down flat like that because it's down flat and then you can fold in the corners these corner points right here and what that will do is essentially create kind of bottom right here a flat ish bottom and that if you do it right will allow the cup to stand up all right so I'm basically just mashing this down right here at this point I'm not trying to do any nice spine creases because I'm at a party right now I'm not really I'm at a party I don't want to take a whole lot of time you know fold them things perfect so there now it has the bottom and the weight of the water inside should help keep this standing all right now let's go check it out let's go see how well holds water [Music] all right so as you can see it is not only full of water but it is actually standing it's not standing perfectly straight up I mean I don't know if you can really tell this angle I'm giving you but it's kind of Leaning a bit that's just because I matched the bottom down nothing for sight anyway that's not important because it is standing and it is holding water it is holding water you can see the surface there and yep perfectly useful if leaking a little bit because you know paper especially if you're using origami paper because it's really thin and I actually don't recommend using origami paper in the first place because it has dye in it you know there's probably something helps concerning in that I don't know as maybe not anyway so hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial hopefully it helps you out and you get to use it in real life situation it's great oh gosh well thanks for watching [Music] just kidding I wouldn't leave you hanging like that anyway thanks again for watching if you haven't subscribed already please do that it shows support for my channel and I'm sure you love the content like this video and be sure to watch my next one when it comes out alright so I think that's all so I will see you in the next video [Music]",

        "video_title": "Dutch Side Braid Ponytail on Natural Hair",
        "video_sub_title": "Welcome back curlfriends! Today we're creating a braided side ponytail. Let's start off with our base. I'm starting off with this really old twist out using the ORS Olive Oil Hair Pudding. I'm just going to section off my sections. Don't mind the gel residue from my Eco Styler. I'll be blending this out. I\"m going to separate my hair. I want a side parting so not so much the middle of my head but more towards the right side of my head. As you can see here, I went ahead and sectioned off the front and the back. It's pretty much my crown section, just a little further back than normal. I'm just going to put a little elastic band around the back to separate it. Now we can begin creating our braid which is pretty much the foundation for this entire hairstyle. You want to make sure that your paring is really nice and clean and sharp because it's going to be showing in this hairstyle. I'm going to reactivate all of my products by spraying some water and adding in a little bit more of my moisturizer before I go ahead and start braiding. As you can see, most of the residue from the Eco Styler has already started to emulsify so I can go ahead and begin my braid. The key to creating this braid is pretty much your positioning of your hands and how fast you braid. You want to take your time when you're creating this braid and position your hands towards your hairline. You're pretty much creating your braid on the base of your hairline and bringing all of the hair forward into that braid. You want to be as big and as thick as possible and to protect your hairline of course. To create that 3D dimensional kind of look you can use the end of a rat tail comb and just lift up the braid to give it some more height and body. As I braid all the way down to the end of this braid, I'm just going to go back in to make my braid just a tad bit more taller. I really want a nice 3D effect. Now that the  hard part is over, we're just going to mist the back ponytail portion of this hairstyle and add some Eco Styler if a gel of your choice. Brush it in to create a nice, smooth and sleek ponytail and add in the braid to this ponytail. It's really easy and simple to achieve. I'm just going to use my Goody Elastic band to create the ponytail that way it doesn't snag or tug at my hair. Last but not least, I'm going to add in my oil sheen spray from ORS. Here's the final look. I hope you guys enjoyed this. Be sure to subscribe to become a curlfriend. Like this video to let me know that you guys are enjoying these natural hair tutorials and product reviews. I will see you guys tomorrow! That's right, tomorrow I'll be back here on the channel.

        "video_title": "How to Fix a Tight Hamstring for Good",
        "video_sub_title": "in this video i'm going to show you how to fix a tight hamstring for good stay tuned hey everyone dr rowe here at spinecare in st joseph michigan so if you're dealing with tight hamstrings back of the leg pain a lot of muscle tightness going on and just need a quick fix this is a video that you're not going to want to miss i'm going to break it down into a three-part process that hopefully will get rid of tight hamstrings for good we're going to focus on massaging the muscle tightness out then stretching it and then finally strengthening the hamstrings so you'll have a lot less instances in the future all of these stretches and exercises can be done at home they're safe effective movements that can give relief in as little as 30 seconds so let's get started with them and get those hamstrings feeling better right now so when it comes to hamstring tightness a lot of people get spasms muscle knots into the back of the leg even that possible charlie horse so what i'm going to do to help relieve that is sit in a chair in very good upright posture we're going to take a racquetball you can also use a tennis ball or a golf ball if you don't have any of those just roll your hand up into a fist so what i'm going to do is go over the spot where i'm having that muscle knot into that hamstring i'm going to place the ball right over that and then use my leg weight to go down towards the floor and then i'm going to take my hands and press into the top of the leg to cause more pressure down into that racquetball only go to your comfort level with this and then from there i just like to then rotate or i should say go into a circular motion with the leg while i put pressure down in there the second part how we're really going to intensify this self massage into the hamstring is let's lift the leg up very slowly and i can actually have a very very good amount of pressure going into my hamstring right now once you're able to go to a point where you feel a lot of pressure into that muscle onto the hamstring hold this one for about five to ten seconds lower the leg and then repeat this up to three to five times or until you feel that muscle not start to release from there you can take the ball and place it over different spots all the way up to the glute and just repeat the process until you feel like all of those muscle knots are relaxed so this next hamstring stretch is one of my favorites because you're going to get a two for one deal on this you're going to hit the quadriceps or the front of the legs here with the hip flexors and you're also going to get a great hamstring stretch i'm going to be using a foldable chair for this you just want something that is sturdy it's not going to roll on you and that is about hip level so you can use a desk a chair a countertop anything like that so let's go right up to our chair use one hand to grab at it and then let's take the other hand and grab at an ankle like this and bend the knee just like this so you're going to feel an initial stretch into the front of the leg that is bent it's going to activate the quadriceps and the hip flexors to start to stretch them out let's focus on making sure our back is upright in very good posture and when we do this what i want to do is bring the leg back just a little bit more to get a more intense stretch into the quads but i'm going to then pivot forward from my hips so i'm not trying to round my back while i do this keep it straight and pivot from the pelvis and from the hips in the leg that is straight you're going to feel a great stretch into the back leg that hamstring go as far as you feel comfortable going towards once you hit that point try to hold this for 10 to 15 seconds you're just going to come back up take a breather and then do this up to five times and then you're just going to simply switch to the other side make sure to do both sides to keep them in balance so this next one really wows most people it's like a hamstring magic trick what i'm going to be using are two rolled up ratty old bath towels so what i'm going to do first is just kind of do like an i like to do a before and after with this one because that's what really amazes people so let's put our feet shoulder width apart and i'm just going to do the classic hamstring stretch that people love to do just rocking forward like this and going all the way down that's about as far as i'm able to go so not quite touching our toes so let's see if we can get this even better what i'm going to do is i'm going to take that towel i'm going to place it in between my knees like this and then go up to the other towel i want to position my toes up on the towel while my heels are flat against the floor so what i'm going to do is squeeze into that towel between our knees and then from there what i want to do is then put my toes out just very very slightly and then go back into that position leaning forward let's try to keep our back as straight as possible while we do this also so let's pivot forward from the hips and the waist and go all the way down until we feel a very good stretch into our hamstrings hold this one right here for 15 seconds and then you're just going to come back up you're going to relax and then you're going to repeat this up to 5 times so with this the second part what i'm going to do is go and place my heels this time around up there and i'm going to take that towel put it back in between my knees and then i'm just going to repeat that same process going down as far as i'm able to go coming back up and then just repeating this for 15 second holds five times so i didn't do it quite five times but even just doing that let's see what i have this time around at that that's not even doing it five times give that one a try so here's a good hamstring stretch if you're an office worker or just do a lot of sitting this is also good if you're just unable to do those ones that we did earlier standing let's go to an edge of a sturdy chair what i'm going to do is whatever hamstring that i'm trying to focus on let's straighten that leg out completely and put the knee straight heel on the floor the other leg is going to be bent 90 degrees at the knee let's get good upright posture while we do this take both hands put it on the straight knee right here and we're going to crawl forward while we pivot from our waist through the hips so try to keep the back straight the more that you crawl down the leg the more intense that stretch is going to get into the hamstring only go to your comfort level with this one try to hold up to 15 seconds if you can work your way up to 30 even better but what you want to do about halfway through this stretch is bring the toes back towards you this is going to intensify it a lot you're going to feel a great hamstring stretch you're also going to feel it into the calves from there once you hit that 15 second 30 second mark relax your foot slowly come back up and then just repeat that process when you do this you're going to notice on the second time you have a little bit more flexibility build into it as much as you can because that's going to help lengthen that hamstring muscle toes back towards us 15 seconds to 30 second holds relax and then just repeat that up to five times make sure to switch to the other side too to keep both sides in balance so if we want to fix hamstring tightness for good and get rid of future instances of achy pain muscle spasms cramps that type of thing we have to strengthen them i'm going to show you two hamstring strengthening exercises they're very simple and straightforward the first one is a hamstring bridge what i'm going to do is lay flat you can do this one in bed or on the floor but what you want to do is put both heels down like this toes up towards the ceiling take your arms and stabilize off to the side a bridge you just simply lift the glutes or the buttock up off the floor or off the bed until your knees your hips and your shoulders are in a nice straight line you should feel the back of the legs really start to fire those hamstrings should definitely be getting a workout you want to drive your weight through your heels on this one and i also try to put my toes out just very slightly i try to hold this one for about 15 seconds if you're able to go longer try to work your way up to 30 seconds you're just going to then lower the butt back down towards the floor take a breather and then you're just going to lift up again and repeat this up to five times it's a wonderful hamstring strengthening exercise this next hamstring exercise we're going to go next to a door or a wall put your feet flat against the door of the wall and make sure the knees are at 90 degrees with the hips and the ankles take our hands stabilize off to the side let's start off by just rocking our pelvis back just a little bit to put it into a neutral position from there i'm going to go into something very similar to that other exercise that we just did that glute bridge lift the butt up off the floor as much as you can and stabilize yourself at your heels with this one you're going to feel the hamstrings in the back the legs here really start to fire just keep lifting up until you hit a very very good point where those muscles are contracting hold this one up to 15 seconds to start off with if you're able to hold it longer 35 i'm sorry 30 or 45 seconds do that but once you are ready to come back down just go back very slowly take a little bit of a breather and then you're just going to repeat this up to five times wonderful exercise if you liked the video and got a lot of relief please show us your support by giving this video a like and maybe

        "video_sub_title": "welcome to ortho eval pal where we help you build confidence in your orthopedic evaluation and management skills hey this is Paul from ortho eval pal and I'm super excited today to to show you this young lady and her knee presentation and the first thing I'm going to say to kylie is thank you for doing this because I really really appreciate this this is the meat potatoes okay we get to and talk about knee injuries and stuff like that and that's all fine and dandy but I think seeing the real thing is probably the most educational part of what we do and I hope you really appreciate this this content it's it's great and again Carolina thank you for taking the time to do this so how old are you 14 14 and when did you injure your left knee Tuesday which we has two days ago correct and you were what were you doing at the time playing soccer okay and when you were playing how did it happen did you did somebody bump into you were you changing directions I was running after the goalie to get the rebound thing and my foot planted in my knee and it buckled inward right okay so it didn't buckle back or forward it was more of an inward type of thing did you fall to the ground yeah you did do you have a hard time getting back up yeah yeah okay and did it swell right away or did it kind of swell over time it did didn't it okay so this has been two days you haven't played since have you been icing it a little bit okay and getting it elevated you haven't had an MRI or nobody's really checked it out yet has it okay so with that in mind and when she walked in today she also had a flexed knee posture she's a little flexed right now I can get my hand under her knee doesn't want to sit very well okay so as you can see she already has an effusion her knee is warm okay this one's nice and cool this one's nice and hot and she has this flexed knee posture she had an inward position when her knee gave out and her foot was planted okay that is very important because as you will see in a little bit as we continue to test we're suspicious of something and the this presentation really paints a good picture so the first thing I want to do is I'm going to ask her to lie right down on the table I just want to see how well I can straighten her and as you can see straightens out dutifully here when I do this not so comfortable is it it's not and that's because she's full of effusion and that puts her knee into this loose pack position okay so we have an intra-articular effusion that tells us that something inside the joint is bleeding and swelling causing your knee to not straighten out very well okay can you tighten up this muscle for me can you push your knee to the table notice how she's having a hard time doing that how about this one keep tighten really hard it tightens nicely and the kneecap moves up so she has some some quadriceps shutting down some reflex inhibition how far can you slide the heel toward your bottom slide it right back there about 95 degrees and where do you feel the pain kind of over the top and that's because it's so full it's right pushing right up there okay so we're gonna let you go right down if I hyperextend you a little bit any pain of that not bad okay so I'm gonna do a couple special tests and just talk to you about what we find and where we're gonna go from here so the first thing I'm gonna start with is just to see if she has any collateral instability we're gonna do a simple of darris and valgus stress test I'm going to start with zero degrees a zero Degree valgus stress test okay so I'm going to hold her full extension I'm going to give a little inward push I don't notice any instability you have any pain with that no I'm gonna flex her to about 30 degrees and I'm gonna do the same thing I'm going to give her a little inward push okay now I'm going to take her to the outside and I'm going to bring her to 0 and when I keep her at 0 and do this very stressed sound look see if she has any capsular instability I'm gonna push not a lot of instability no opinion with that okay now I'm gonna bring her down to 30 degrees I'm gonna do the same thing a little bit of laxity but I already tested the other leg and she has an equal amount of laxity and that doesn't hurt does it okay great now I know she has fluid throughout the knee so trying to assess if she has a meniscus tear is gonna be very difficult with this much swelling because I can't flex her all the way so doing the MacMurray's test may not be great right now the nice thing I'm going to do is a Lachman test okay so this is where I really want the patient to relax okay I'm gonna support her femur we're gonna keep her at about 20 25 degrees my left hand is going to be under her tibia okay now relax that leg I'm going to give a little anterior pull and notice we have some anterior instability there is not a good endpoint either I don't feel an end point so I'm going to sneak over to the other leg and I'm going to show you what that other leg looks like so we can compare so I want you to relax you feel the difference okay you feel like this one has a knock in it okay and I don't have this extra excursion all right so come back around here if you can't handle the leg very well with your hands put that leg right on your thigh give it a little stability here and that'll be a lot easier you give a little anterior pull and it's very subtle notice the excursion and I don't get an end point so we're very suspicious that this young lady has an ACL tear we've already talked to her and her dad about it at this stage of the game we need to order up an MRI and recommend seeing an orthopedist but what we're going to do is we're gonna work on getting rid of the swelling getting it elevated doing some compression re-educating this quadricep because if she does need to have surgery she's gonna need a lot of quads and a lot of balance and so we're gonna work on to get her started in PT right off here for that though thank you very much for watching and listening to this video please feel free to leave any questions or comments and if you have any other questions get me on WWF eval calm we hope you've enjoyed this video and for more awesome content go to ortho eval Pal comm can't wait to see you there [Music] you [Music]",

        "video_title": "How to Recognize Category C Bioterrorism Agents",
        "video_sub_title": "Beware of common dispersal methods for bioterrorism agents. One of the biggest challenges that would-be bio-terrorists face is finding way to administer their biological agents in ways that preserve the lethality of the agents themselves. Many dangerous microbes are difficult to grow and cultivate, while still others are fragile and die when exposed to air or light. Know the most common delivery methods for bioterrorism agents (listed below) so that, in the event of an attack, you will be better prepared to protect yourself. Keep up-to-date on emerging pathogen threats. Category contains many emerging pathogens that is, infectious diseases that have recently had an increased incidence in humans or otherwise are poised for such an increase. Keeping up-to-speed on the status of these types of diseases worldwide can allow you to be aware of likely bioterrorism agents before theyre used. Research bio-weapons. Understanding the history of bio-weapon development is useful for understanding the current threat. Agents that have been mass produced or engineered in the past are more likely to surface in the future, even if these stock piles have been destroyed. Dissemination of biological agents is complex, sophisticated process, so, by researching historical accounts of the usage of such agents, the dangers and limitations of Category agents can become more apparent. Report suspicious activities to the authorities. If you believe you may have information about biological attack, even if its far-fetched, its better to be safe than sorry. Suspicious activity, especially around hospitals, medical waste facilities, and similar places should be reported to the authorities immediately. Odd or suspicious letters and packages should be turned over to the police without being opened. Be vigilant for other threats if youre able to quickly report bioterrorism attack, you may save many lives. Stockpile supplies. In the event of biological attack, it may be impossible to leave the house for some time. Thus, its important that your family has what it needs to survive without help from the outside world. There are many resources for emergency planning which you may want to consult, as the necessary supplies and procedures are generally the same regardless of the emergency. Protect yourself in the event of an attack. If you experience bioterrorism attack, do everything you can to protect yourself and your loved ones from possible exposure. The key here is prevention being ready for an attack well in advance is the best way to be able to survive. Have plan to quickly gather your loved ones in quarantined area (like your house) where youll have access to supplies, like gas masks, hazard suits, and radio or television (so that youll be able to know when the threat passes).",

        "video_title": "How to Increase Hemoglobin - 7 Proven Ways | How to Increase Hemoglobin In A Week",
        "video_sub_title": "Hemoglobin is a protein found in red blood cells. These cells carry oxygen around the body. Normal concentrations of hemoglobin in the blood are 13.5 to 18 g/DL in males and 12 to 16 g/DL in females. If your hemoglobin levels are low, you can increase through 7 Natural Ways to Improve Hemoglobin. 1. Eat Iron-Rich Foods. Iron is an important element in hemoglobin production. If you\u2019re suffering from the low hemoglobin count, increase your consumption of iron-rich foods such as: beetroot, tofu, Eggs, Green leafy vegetables like spinach, Lean meats, like chicken and beef, Certain fruits like pineapple, apples, and pomegranates, Beans and other legumes and Nuts like almonds. 2. Increase your intake of vitamins C. Vitamin C can facilitate iron absorption in the body. It can be acquired by consuming these fruits and vegetables: Oranges, Strawberries, Mangoes, Tangerines, Broccoli, Spinach, Cabbage, And Peppers. 3. Eat more folic acid-rich foods. Folic acid is a B-complex vitamin that is required to make red blood cells in the body. Foods rich in folic acids include: Seeds, Wheat germ, Sprouts, Peanuts, Nuts, And Broccoli. 4. An Apple a Day. An apple a day can help to maintain a normal level of hemoglobin since apples are rich in iron plus other health-friendly components that are required for a healthy hemoglobin count. 5. Drink Nettle Tea. Nettle is an herb that is an excellent source of B vitamins, iron, vitamin C and can play a key role in raising your hemoglobin level. The more iron you take, it will produce the more hemoglobin. 6. Avoid Iron Blockers. Avoid iron blockers these are food items that can block the body\u2019s ability to absorb iron. Examples of iron-blocking foods are: Coffee, Milk, Tea, Colas, wine, and beer. 7. Exercise. Moderate to high-intensity workouts are highly recommended, because when you exercise - your body produces more hemoglobin to meet the increasing demand for oxygen throughout the body. Bonus Tip: Beetroot is highly recommended for increasing the body\u2019s red blood cell count as it is high in folic acid as well as iron, potassium, and fiber.

        "video_sub_title": "hi I'm coach Adam from boot coach comp and in this video I'm going to show you how to trim your mustache properly the inspiration for this video came from a gentleman who sent me an email via the contact link on the website desperately needing tips on how to trim his moustache so this one's for you buddy and hopefully it helps a lot of other people out as well ok so the first thing you need to keep in mind is there's two type of mustache trends we could talk about and I will get to both okay so the first is when you're going to keep some link to your mustache but you need to kind of get up off your lip it gets really annoying when your mustache kind of hangs down over your lip every time you take a sip of a drink it gets little beads above whatever you're drinking and the mustache drips down your shirt it's like Adam a pain so it's a good idea to sort of keep those hairs trimmed up along your lip line and that's really the secret is when you're trimming this thing just kind of follow you the natural contour of your upper lip I like to use a beard trimmer like this one I think it's nice because as these removable heads and this one is a little bit narrower for kind of easier access and control in that mustache area okay so like I said I'm just going to go in and I'm going to just follow the contour of my upper lip with this beard trimmer let's do it all right so now after you make your first pass it's a good idea just kind of brush your moustache a little bit really kind of stroke it down just to make sure you don't have any other hairs hanging down over your lip that you may have missed so take another look so I could do it a pretty good job here maybe touch up a spot and there we go that's really all it takes do you want to keep some link to your mustache you really just have to kind of go in and just just follow the contour of your leg okay so the second type of mustache trim you can have is when you want to shorten the whole thing up the whole thing is too long kind of weighing you down and you want it to be a nice sort of shorter length so when I do that I remove this head from my beard trimmer and replace it with the one that I use for my beard this one because it's kind of easy to control the length of your mustache that way so says nine settings I'm going to set it on setting six this little kind of leave a little bit of length so I'm sort of sacrificing it's nice longer mustache for you guys to teach you this lesson so I want to make it a little easier for it to grow back so hopefully a six will do it okay so kind of a secret to doing this right is is to know where your beard ends and your mustache begins and the way I do that is I just follow the upper line of my beard down trace it down my finger and sort of scoop up the hair up above that okay so anything above that line is mustache anything below that line is beard so you can see my hair is pretty long and I can actually kind of pick them up and sort of fit a mustache trimmer underneath them like that I can do it on the other side as well so that's sort of where I get started I kind of just followed the follow the contour of my beard pick it up get the get the Clippers up in there and then it's really just a matter of kind of running this thing over the whole mustache it does all the work of getting it even for you so let's knock it out you and there you go that's all it takes like I said the chamber does all the work you just have to be careful not to go too low into your beard and trim some of that precious beard hair off another good thing to do after you've got it all down give it give it another brush and take another look and see if anything is hanging over the lip that you don't want I come on and knock some of these little hairs off the corners down because those can kind of actually poke into bottom lip a little bit so it's kind of nice to sort of remove this whole guard and just get it down to the bare blade or you can switch back to your moustache attachment but I'm just going to kind of do this because I'm a pro at it nice oh you got to be careful not to cut your lip when you're doing that it's really just to knock those little hairs off the corner they get annoying someday you'll probably see what I'm talking about so that's it that's that's all there is to trim in a great mustache it's really just a matter of having the right tool I never really scissor trim my mustache because I have this thing I mean you can pick these things up anywhere it makes the job a lot easier so two types of trim one keeps the length one gets rid of it so there you go go get your clippers and get a nice looking mustache and be the best beard ambassador you can be until next time I'm coach Adam and hope to see check out vid coach comm",

lot of bobby pins on have like a little hold there and eat lots of bobby pins this one that's the color of your hair so I use black okay so now she's got like this so now that I had my hair back down again we'll try one word two of the roles are kind of making sort of a heart shape exactly making their heart and sorting brush it all out again and going to off off center go from the point of here I about sometimes I use them a per fresh color brush for people that get their hair color and Whitford I'd hate to say that good but for us black girls we use this to put firm in our hair sometimes it is to help make my parts it just goes away with cinnamon in a cone so kind of a rounded shape I'll show you inside correctly because I don't have it right now so see how light off-center the point of my eyebrow it kind of and it kind of abruptly because on this side we're gonna have another will have a different role that comes in on this side so we want this this is going to go back and around that's why we the shape is important so what's fitness to the sides we have to make sure that our shame for this side is good that you have this side your little shape we have extra hair on this side which will mate probably would be difficult to make this into one world since the part is not parts not really symmetrical but still it'll work leave that to the side one two three hopefully everything so far first of all I'm going to do is this one this role will set the tone for where this one although so much in this one person just like you've done all that others you're going to direct just like this maybe close it down a little bit lower so that you can get for bridges so don't hold it up his height the other video and older and make this one and this this role when you said it it needs to be a little bit more forward than the last one because we want to kind of look like a heart and it's not really going to but I say it does as opposed to if I can get it so they have to see how it kind of sets forward and you can see into the wall use your fingers to open it up you want don't worry about the flyaways hairspray or get another bobby pin and pin it down you know this one we want to comb it back the right my right probably well it's my right with my right hand back into the right a little slant right above the way yeah you have it he is close to that other role as you begin it and starting to get inside first for this one because you don't want it to run your oh sorry my voice is kind of low sick that's why I look bad a little bit right like I said it's not exactly look like a heart but it's close enough it's all right darlin Hammerman now because of the weird see how that I hope you part going on you can choose to curl this and just let this be there or if you're like me and you're lazy they'll just keep it all together and make the best of it I mean this world well if you're going to put a flower in your hair which and I am you're not really gonna see the side so as well as movie sites so I mean this one could pretty much be crap and put a huge flower to hide it we're accessories I love their accessories they hide that mistakes so we have it same deal as all the others hold it two fingers wrap it around I mean see how long my areas you kind of want to hold it so that I can have a bit amount to twist the higher you start yeah I guess I could say the more fluffy your roll but the lower you start the more control you have over your roll and where you can place it start up to I and roll all the way down it's gonna be kind of difficult to control we're going to put that roll and your arms get tired like I said and fix it flower little flower this I'll be back in like two shakes and later so just hang on with a little bit of flour so I can show you how to do it but came back hopefully that wasn't too long a lot of dead space okay so this I mean it myself I just put like a little clip on the back and they put them together so you can just go ahead and clip that let's try this again or this one I also made myself I just glued some gardenias I got from Walmart on to a clone just slide that baby or you can choose to go without if you do go without just make sure you smooth it put your hairspray you need it you have your bobby pins in about Lantern we don't look stylish to not mess you know you have mistakes and you want to hide those mistakes accessories so they see how I've smoothed it out inside you should be able to see inside of these especially on this side that's like I said it kind of forms a heart some things are better than others but like I said once you pin it down you can play with it here that's how you do it those two tutorial download I thought this is gonna be a lot harder than actually that I will

mellow me to basically raise and lower the plow that way I can put it in like a travel height and then drop it for plowing mode if I want to the oil drum if you want to call it that is going to be the basis for the plow itself thinking maybe cut it at an angle or just cut straight in half and do it like that and just cut away at the top I've got plenty of t-post for reinforcing wall more blades the works so let's get to it hey a bunch of sparks that's smoke and paint burning off and everything but other than that we are cut now let's go get it on the mower see how she fits just about perfect

just basically chefs note one way or the other way so I'm gonna get back to work grinding and see what I come up with all right pins made all I did was take up a piece of all thread ground the threads off this was a junk piece damn thing cross thread if it isn't here tight but still enough movement to where it won't basically it'll allow the blade to what now just got a weld it here let that end down it's more stable well bat then I'll have my pivot point so that's next if that welded get that on there make sure everything works fine and it's cut the barrel into working okay drums cut that was a pain switch between the saws on the grinder here we go looks like one may put a piece of metal just right here let's start but some things right here but also back here go to here get some strength where I can now the bottom for a bite edge I've got plenty of old lawnmower blades but those on the bottom to basically break up ice or scrape the ground get rid of that as well but they look a little small but it's gonna be perfect for the sidewalks and so forth so got a lot more work to do but when it's done it's gonna be well worth it so let's keep going okay here's what I got so far I'm probably gonna end tack this all up and then call it a day it's like 5:30 so getting close to dinnertime and might as well call it quits so here we go so far burning up doing sticking piece of angle iron puttin in the fourth set up over there put the ends in flatten them out on the high beam with mini suede denim on both sides those will help strengthen it up I'm gonna plan on putting this lawnmower blade dead center and then been an immediate bar going all three that will help keep it the back end straight and then on the bottom I got two mower blades that I'm going to continue to flatten out and so forth dump most of them already done but flat nose out get an edge and they'll be the bite edge rest on the bottom it's gonna take moves to the brunt and punishment that this thing's gonna take then my plan here is I may make a bolt that goes to a plate on both front and rear methods on another one back here but to where it holds the scissor jack damn excuse me and to where I can just oh that's the warm basically winters over pull this out pull this off take them out to the barn storm workloads can stay here and it's not permanently attached and also I can put my winter back on if I ever get a chance to get one so that's that and also all this Cosme was like 28 bucks but that was for the scissor jack from auto parts store or wally world or wherever you wanted to go so you want to keep up in its updates projects that I decided to get it on and also if I get a certain number of subscribers I may tell you have a upcoming project that well be a bit of an undertaking but when it's done it'll be nice and it's not putting the 7 3 and that's going to be a worker long project that's after I get the police or I've been running and I have another vehicle trying but the place is top priority right now talk about the landing Kansas today blowing in the car tarp over so you wanna stay up with projects or see how well tied build for a little or no money but just scrap metal I got up here at the place or even out at the property more if I decided to take workhorse out on a rom so subscribe comment and give this video a like if you want so until next time peace out",

        "video_sub_title": "They took me back to a room, and then really quickly there were a lot of nurses and a few doctors. They got me fixed up. I mean, they didn't fix anything, but we put a nice big bandaid on it. \u266c Oh, you gotta breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe \u266c \u266c Let it go and let it be, be, be \u266c Good morning guys. Good morning. We're both kind of on the struggle bus. He said he feels like he got hit by a truck yes- er, today. Yeah. Because yesterday was insane. We had to rush to the emergency room. And thankfully... Thankfully, it was just pain. Well, basically my, the lining of my lung is... inflamed and rubbing or something that's causing the pain, but the pain is a lot more under control today. Which we're super grateful for. I preached in the morning and I was, I didn't sleep much the night before, and then we rushed to the ER. So like today, I woke up and I was just like, I just feel exhausted. Which makes total sense. Um... Yeah, we are, but in the midst of it all, Mary's blood sugar is super low at the moment. I was just FaceTiming my mom and I saw that my blood sugar was heading down. So I drank a juice box. And then it said... [vocalizing alarm sound] Like, you're going down again, and, or you're still going down. And I was like, that's weird. So I drank another juice box. And then it's like... [vocalizing alarm sound] So then I checked manually and it was 51. So I was like... I'm gonna go... try to figure out why this won't come back up. So I just drank a third juice box. Um, I think one of the medications, the pain med is causing me to go low, which we suspected a few years ago. Yeah. And so maybe this is proving, but my team switched my antibiotic. So a delivery driver dropped off a package of meropenem, and we're upping the dose of Mary's vancomycin, and she needs to do IVIG. And I need to do my fluids. So let me see what time it is. It is 4:10. Meropenem just finished. If I do... an hour and a half of fluids... 5:30... Yeah. And then 6:30, 7:30, 8:30, 9:30. That's fine. That's plenty of time, because the next dose is at 11:00. And then at 12. So you got a little bit of flex time, but you should start those fluids. I'll start the fluids. Make sure my blood sugar comes up. Um... My mouth feels kind of numb. And my body feels kind of warm. Well, your blood sugar is pretty low, so... I wonder, and it's kind of tingly. We're gonna take care of this girl and... try to get that blood sugar up. And I think you should, like... chill out and watch a movie or something. Oh, I was just almost sleeping on the porch. Oh, were you? Yeah. Did you have your eyes closed? Yeah, but then I came in and Mary's blood sugar was- Why did you come in? Oh, I don't know. I just wanted to check on you. Aww. That's so sweet! Peter said he saw a blue jay outside. I did, this morning. Have we told them the story of the blue jay? [Mary] You need to tell them. Yesterday I walked out and there was a blue jay in the yard, and it was, I think it was chasing other birds cuz they're not known to be very nice, but... Mary and I... I, have we told this story? Okay. So the story of the blue jay. We've never seen one in real life in years, and then Mary was just talking about that, and we go on the trip to Duke when Mary got evaluated for a lung transplant. One day we walk out of our Airbnb, while we're there at Duke, and there, I think, no, it was the day, I think it was Wednesday when it was a really rough day of the transplant evaluation. And we came home. I think this was what it was. We came outside and there was a blue jay in the tree outside of our Airbnb, and it was just like, I mean, they're, they're beautiful birds, and it was a neat moment of enjoying the beauty of this bird, and was it Wednesday afternoon when we saw it? [Mary] Yes. Trying to remember. Okay. Yes. Right after we got back from rehab. Yeah, so it was just like this sweet moment we felt like that was a gift from God that we saw that and the birds were chirping in the trees and it was a neat moment. So, that's the original story of the blue jay, and then we come... I feel like maybe I've told you guys this, but we come back from that trip and we're in Maryland, we're kind of making a pit stop for a couple days, visiting with family before heading back to Massachusetts after the Duke trip, and... the day before we left Maryland we got the call from the Duke transplant team and basically, saying... for the future, you're kind of accepted as a patient in like... we feel like you're a candidate for the future, and... We had pulled over the car when Mary got that call pop up that said Durham, and we're sitting in this parking lot, and there in a tree in the parking lot was a blue jay bird. So it was just like, this sweet like, twice in one week, all surrounding like, hard things. And then I walked out of the house yesterday. Well, there was one more after that. that you saw. Yeah, I saw one. I can't remember when that was. I, was it when you flew down to buy a house? It might have been. And then when we left the hospital a week and a half ago, we pull out of the hospital parking garage... sitting at a stop sign in the city, and there's a blue jay. And then yesterday, I walk out of the house and see a blue jay, and then the day turns into this crazy adventure of going to the ER and everything. Anyways, we like blue jays. Even though they're mean. [Mary] Yeah, but... [Mary] Why they gotta be mean? [chuckling] But they're beautiful. But, so anyways, that's uh... Mary's getting hooked up to fluids right now. Are you still feeling tingly? I think it's starting to come up. Okay, so we're gonna have to, um... I feel like your, your port right now, like this afternoon, is like a high, um... Popular? Popular person, like a popular thing, and we have to like, schedule out when drugs can be infused into it. And so... I have, like, sometimes thought... I wouldn't need a double-lumen. So, some ports are Two spots, two spots to stick needles in. Two needles in. Yeah. Which I, that does not sound comfortable, but... Gotta do what you gotta do. But yeah, in some scenarios that's really helpful for mostly... Mary wouldn't need that. Which, if you had a Y on you could do like, your fluids and a drug. Yes. But... Couldn't do two drugs. Most drugs can't go together. Some can though, but like, vancomycin can't go with a lot of things and... They just have to be, you know, flush your line in between. Yeah. Apparently it like, the drug reaction of vancomycin and other things causes it to crystallize, right? Yeah, I feel like that's what they told me. Crazy. Crystals in your blood does not sound like a good idea. Doesn't sound like a great idea. I don't know. I've never tried it though. So, alright. We'll see you guys later. You guys remember our discussion about using medical things as everyday life and everyday life things for medical. I'm wondering if I can come up with a use for this, like, these used... IV supplies. This was just... saline solution, so it wasn't like a medication or anything. And what I was wondering, because we have a trip coming up soon, which it looks like I'll probably still be on IVs, which I wasn't gonna be, but now I am, but IVs never stopped me from celebrating life anyway, right? So we're just gonna make the most of it. Where can I set you? Okay, so here's my thought. What if I... fill this up with regular water, hang it by my plants. So, like maybe... [Mary] Maybe like, hang it beside this plant or my cabbage plant. And somehow... set it to just do... a slow drip, so it doesn't like, flood the plant. And then just stick this end in the plant and then hang this next to it. Would that work while I'm gone? I guess I could try it. I could try it. I don't know if I said this, but the pain today is a lot more manageable. This morning, of course, the pain meds had worn off through the night, this morning it hurt. But it wasn't as bad as it was yesterday. So the inflammation in itself is getting better. But then as I was waking up and coughing, coughing hurts it really bad. And of course you can't avoid coughing. Um, so I took the pain meds and then within about an hour the pain was a lot less, much more manageable. It's like, I still feel it, like, I still... it's still there, and I definitely wouldn't be able to like, do PFTs right now. That forced inhale and exhale would hurt really really bad, and... there's a little gnat flying around. So anyway, I'm just feeling so thankful because the, I mean, hey, if you ask me, that pain... along with the help of the meds, is resolving faster than I could have imagined or hoped. So, one day of excruciating pain. And really, it was... just kind of that first half of yesterday. I mean, it hurt all day, but like... when it's manageable, that's manageable, but it was just... It was rough. When we got to the ER... they already knew I was coming cuz my doctor had told them, and they were really really sweet. I think they saw how much pain I was in, and I just really appreciated their swiftness. Um... I saw like a little gif or jif or whatever... of a race car pulling into the pit stop, and all those people swoop in around the car and like, fix the tires or whatever they need to do. That's how it felt when I got to the ER. They took me right back to a room. My hospital doesn't allow CF patients to wait in a waiting room, which I'm really grateful for. That is something I will really really miss about leaving this hospital. Um... I appreciate the safety in mind with the lack of waiting rooms, but they took me back to a room and then really quickly there were a lot of nurses and a few doctors all in the room all around me, which was really, I was like, whoa, I did not expect that. But they were um, they were on top of things, and... they got me fixed up. I mean, they didn't fix anything, but we put a nice big bandaid on it now. Now I'm transferring the IVIG into the bag, and then I'll start it. Peter's back. He went to the grocery store. [Mary] Peter! You wanna say hi? Hi guys. I'm making some salmon and sweet potatoes and asparagus on the grill tonight for dinner. Guys, I just got off the phone and I went outside with Ollie. Wait till you see this. Oh wow, I see it like, reflecting off of, uh... the houses around. Look at this. Wait for it. Wait for it. Oh, the camera's just not doing it justice. Hold on. Look at this night sky. [Peter] It's just, it's getting brighter by the second. [Peter] What do you think, Ollie? Is that the most beautiful sunset you ever did see? Okay, I feel like that sunset was one of those you just had to be there, but sometimes, guys, you guys know this. Life is overwhelming sometimes. You... We live in a crazy world. We walk through crazy things and, uh... It's full of unexpected. I remember when I was working on my master of divinity and life was crazy and Mary was in the hospital. I remember it was one... I'm trying to think when it was specifically, but it was a January, I was taking a January class, and it was like, one of these intensives, and Mary had to go in the hospital in the middle of the class, and it was like... Hebrew translation and I'm like, learning this ancient language and feeling overwhelmed, and I walked outside and beautiful seminary campus, we were living on the campus at the time, and I looked up and looked at the stars and just... It kind of helped me, like, it was like, one of those moments where God was reminding me that there's so much more than... my overwhelmed state at the moment, and a reminder that the guy who created all this walks with us in the midst of hard things, and it was just a really good moment for me to recalibrate, and get some perspective. Every time I come out at night I remember that day of feeling so overwhelmed and looking up the sky and just letting my heart recalibrate. And anyways, I hope you enjoyed that sunset. You had to be there, but Mary's inside. She's... doing her vest, and I think today was a little bit of a... recovery day. We're gonna wrap it up here for today, and say... [both] As always, we will see you tomorrow. Good  night. \u266c And let's go say goodnight to the one and only Ollie boy. I know he's the one you guys really show up for. [Peter] Hey Ollie, say good night. Say good night to the people. You just keeping guard? [Peter] Just keeping guard. Good night buddy, we'll see you tomorrow.",

        "video_sub_title": "investigators from from Britain looked at the efficacy of vitamin d3 which is the naturally produced vitamin on preventing protein excretion in patients who have diabetes and kidney disease so many of these patients were at a point where their kidneys had begun to fail but had not failed to the same to the extent that they required dialysis so these were people with kidney disease as a result of diabetes prior to the initiation of dialysis and in this study the investigators gave vitamin d3 in doses sufficient to increase the levels to a particular concentration and showed that the people who got vitamin d3 had less protein in the urine and they had less of a amounts of a particular substance known as transforming growth factor beta that is responsible for fibrosis or the development of fibrosis in the kidney it was a small study and it's not entirely certain that this can be extrapolated to large groups of patients but it does suggest that among non-smoking diabetics there is a beneficial effect of giving vitamin d3 in in preventing the progression of kidney disease or certainly in preventing an increase in protein excretion and the formation of this substance that causes fibrosis or scarring in the kidney now I would hasten to add that the study is very small they got different results in smokers versus non-smokers which is not easily and the definitive tests for looking at progression of kidney function were not done so I think but but certainly the data is very suggestive of there being a beneficial effect of vitamin d3 administration in patients who have diabetes low vitamin D levels to begin with and who have kidney dysfunction at the same time now I think that when vitamin d3 is given in the amounts that were given in this study the the toxicity or some of the side effects of vitamin D are very the incidence of those side effects is very low so we would be safe to give amounts in the amount that was given in the study without causing any side effects clearly larger trials are needed to confirm these studies with more definitive endpoints but I think it's a step in the right direction showing that the administration of vitamin d3 may be helpful in a subset of patients who have chronic kidney failure in this case due to diabetes I would caution it against doing that I think that if someone has diabetes and chronic kidney disease they should see their doctor who could then measure the levels of a vitamin D metabolite in the blood called 25 hydroxy vitamin D if the levels of that particular substance were on the low side then under those circumstances under supervision administering vitamin d3 would be of help because it would prevent more protein from appearing in the urine and potentially more damage from occurring the problems with giving indiscriminate vitamin D in doses that can cause calcium and phosphorous to rise is that that elevation in calcium and phosphorus can further damage the kidney and so this has to be done under supervision",

        "video_title": "Repairing A Lifted Acrylic Nail - Step By Step Tutorial",
        "video_sub_title": "hi it's Suzy from nail career education normally my nails look good all the time but they've taken a real beating during this renovation of my new salon this thumb in particular has had a bad go I'm gonna fix it repair it because sometimes we do have to deal with really badly lifted Vicky's nails so that's what we do today let's get started so most clients that come in for regular fill they're very smooth cuticles no lifting and we can just buff them and fill them and it's pretty easy and pretty simple but every now and then you'll get something like this and because this happened to me during the Renault I just thought takes some time and show you how to do this because I've never really seen anything like this before when it's this lifted so number one thing when we're filling a nail is you must take up any lifted discolored ugly acrylic or gel whenever you're working with so in this case you can sort of see this is actually lifted severely on this one side right over from here all the way over to here this is all lifted there's a crack along here and there look piers to be a crack over here before you put any new product on that all of this achiness has got to go that's the renovation on the nail before we apply so in order to do that you can hand file it but that would be a lot of work I'm going to drill it okay here's another tip for you when you're taking out a bubble or anything that's lifted the wider it is the more it's lifted you want to file around the bubble because sometimes falling on the bubble is really kind of pointless because it's already lifted if you file around the bubble and make it thin sometimes you can just pop it right out maybe that'll happen here I just put my mask on and I'll show you how to file this horrible little thumb so I'm going to take my drill and the tip of it right in here the angle of it very carefully and just do short little bursts because you don't want to burn too much friction turning and burn just go short little bursts of where you see the crack and here's a little crack over here I'm going to file that out too I do short little bursts so it doesn't burn now this whole thing might be kind of ugly over here but this definite here I'm going to show you this bubble part when it's lifted this much you can file around the lift you see what I'm trying to do I'm like digging a little seam almost between where it's lifted and where it's adhered if I get this thin enough I can sometimes just take my finger and flake it oh look at this this is good I mean bad but good watch this if I pull this a little bit you can see how lifted it is so look right down in there that is so lifted right off that bad boys got to go it's also ugly and discolored so I'm going to take now if you just rip it off that might work in this case it looks like it might if you can just peel it right off I'm only being able to peel this off right now because it is not actually adhered to the nail if it was somewhat adhered you wouldn't want to pull it off like that because it would rip natural nail and you don't want to distress the natural nail so this is actually not adhered but it is joined right there so this is I'm going to do I'm going to file where I see that it's joined so if I just file this really thin in here get it thin and thin and thin I don't want to rip it in this one spot because it's going to rip my natural nail it's actually adhered to that side these are some of the worse to do they're such a pain and it can hurt the client but never never never rip it off don't take a tip and push it off don't take some pliers and rip it off it really will damage the nationale and then it'll bite you in the butt too because if you put a new nail on it and you've ripped it there's less natural nail for the new nail to adhere to so I filed it thin enough look at that it's not ripping the nail what so came off so so easily so now I'm going to file up the natural nail and make it get rid of the paint on there for one thing it's not a look I want and I'm going to file the existing acrylic and try to make it as smooth as possible and I'll tell you why if I don't file the existing acrylic it's a different color when I put the new stuff on overtop of this that color can come through so it's been you look like you'll look into the nail and it's going to be different levels of different color so if you want to look a little bit more smooth and blemish free then take away all the stuff that's on there very gently because you're filing against natural nail so now I'm just making this existing acrylic as thin as I can and do it very gently because it's close to the natural nail but I'm trying to make it seamless as possible okay so then you can take your natural file if you want and just buff that natural now now we're prepping it for the product and you can shorten the national if you want it's totally optional you can leave it if you want or you can assure them it doesn't really matter if it's scraggly shorten it okay I'm going to see if I can file the last little bits of this off and prepare this nail for the application so now it's down to the natural nail so all the natural nail there I filed with the arbor band I use a medium bit or a fine I don't use the carbide and then when it comes to filing the acrylic to get it off I use this bit this is the carbide bit with the medium to fine teeth okay so don't use this on the natural nail so it's all prepped ready to go now I'm going to disinfect it and then I'm going to primer it and we are ready for the application that's a disinfectant that can go everywhere oh wait that dries a little bit and then I can put the primer on I'm going to form it now that natural nail is intact I didn't off the crap out of it and I didn't peel the old nail off and pull any natural nail off didn't want to do it okay he's ready to go for a natural nail application that's what I'm going to do here for you primers ready gonna gently put that home okay we've disinfected it we've prepped it and we put the primer on it it's ready to go for replication so for fun purposes as I instruct with the application process I'm going to apply three different colors to create a very natural pretty look okay so the first stage is this area in here will be a very light bright soft pink then we're going to go into more of a colored pink like I'm like a foundation would work so it's a mixture of the two together then the end so it doesn't see-through it looks more natural will be a bit more of a cover pink which means it's a little bit more opaque and it has more of a dense color in it you'll see the colors as they go down so we'll start with the cuticle and I'm going to soften that right into it it's a beautiful color it's one of my favorite colors just a nice soft on the bluer side pink more of a cool pink might say then we're going to go into a blend and this is that cool pink mix with what I'm going to put on the end cover kick this is in the middle you can get nice and square this I'll make this is a square nail and then you can see the natural free edge showing through I don't want to see that so much this is where my cover pink comes in so quite a bit more opaque be able to see that and that should cover that free edge look I also could have shortened it you still would see a little bit of it so I'm going to use the cover pink to cover it completely so it looks like I've used one color but I've actually used three to create this particular look and I'm going to make it quite square okay I'm just going to add a little bit of my arch in there make sure these for the structure I like to blend it during the application just so it makes it a little bit easier for filing you don't have to okay check my end make sure it's thick enough that looks good so before I begin filing I always put my powders in my liquid away just because I wouldn't want any filings old ones to get into my new stuff so I like to keep it nice and clean okay now violet that's how you tell it's dry I always hand file the shape not affected really to do it with a drill you can do the bulk of it but most of it should be done with a hand file if you click square just respecting the ends so they're not thickens okay now I'm using the softer side of this 180 file then I'm going to use the softer setting even going down in grades and great and that makes for a very smoothly male PAH okay now we're just going to oil it then I just put oil and the cuticle get rid of the dust massage it in wash the hands and put some polish on that looks a lot better mm-hmm from that poor little damaged nail so you can see even though I use three different colors it doesn't create a patchwork look it looks really natural but it covers any imperfection that a person might have on their natural nail so I'm just going to complete the look with a nice soft pink just to keep it quite natural there you go until next time",

        "video_sub_title": "[Music] welcome I want to show you three great tnj stretches that you can do particularly if you're having jaw pain headaches neck pain even those people who have chronic forward head posture the muscles that are mainly affected are the lateral medial pterygoid and the inside of the cheek the masseter muscles which are your big strong muscles on both sides of your face while clenching and chewing you have the temporalis muscles up in here that work right along with the TMJ the temporal mandibular joint the first part of exercise is that we're going to work the lateral to medial region of the jaw that means go inside the side this is a big problem for many of you so we'll check both of them the make sure that you're moving correctly take your right hand and put it on the temporal area of your head right here above your ear and you'll take your left hand we're going to work the left side as we contact the left side we're going to take the left seeing our eminence right in here we're going to put it over the TMJ when you open and close your mouth you'll feel it move over that joint and what we'll do is we'll take this right hand we'll push up against the head as we take this to stabilize it and we'll take the left side and we just push inwards just like this relax the jaw push it in and hold it in good just stretch it nice and easy hold it about 10 15 seconds and switch so this hand will go up on top the opposite on the temporal temporal region this part of my hand right here will blow over the TMJ on the other side on the right and we're just going to push as we stabilize the head and push with the other hand okay you'll feel the jaw go to the left as you're pushing with your right hand stretch it not too hard just feel a nice stretch beautiful the second part of the stretch is we're going to work the TMJ by bringing it medial and downward so it can stretch and release different muscles that are potentially limiting your range of motion so we'll work the left side first so if we work the left side you'll take your left hand grab you're right temporal area like this and we'll take the right hand and we'll kind of hold on with our fingers over the TMJ with your hands over the ramus of the jaw like this okay and what we're going to do is we're going to just pull it down like this good you'll feel a nice stretch in there okay then we'll switch hands so what we'll do here is that we'll grab the left forehead on the left side of temporal area with the right hand take your left hand on the right tnj grab the ramus of the jaw like this okay it's covering the draw your fingers are over tan jay and you're going to pull down down and in okay like you're counteracting it like your count they're pulling it as you're stretching those muscles and you'll hold that just keep holding those muscles very good feel nice stretch the last part of the stretch very effective is we're going to work the translation as a jaw goes forward and backwards but the most common involvement is when the jaw goes backwards so what we'll do is that we can use either hand whichever is comfortable for you so I'm going to use my right hand on my draw the left hand will stabilize behind my head I'm going to cut these fingers like this and just put it over my bottom of my jaw here and I'm going to stabilize this hand on my head as I push forward a little bit as I take the other hand if I relax my mouth closing my lips and pushing it backwards like this and as you push back or if you feel a nice stretch in that TMJ area as you release those muscles I hope these exercises make a big impact in your health do these stretches that will reduce a lot of inflammation take away pain I ask you to leave your comments to see how you're doing so other people can benefit from them share these videos and make it a great day I'm dr.

        "video_sub_title": "hi there it's dr. Chuck from my back loop comm in this long but informative video I'm going to cover the two quick and easy soft Corrections for an elevated or high hip oftentimes a high hip causes a shoulder problem higher up or a foot knee problem down below we're going to talk about the high hip and for this discussion let's assume that the right hip is high you have to fix or address or self correct the high hip otherwise you're walking around with compensations if this hip is high I'm going to have compensations higher up in my shoulders and then in my neck in my head so you're going to the gym and you're working out with the weights or you're going doing some activity you know walk around with this you're just driving this distortion into your body so you want to level your hip because it's extremely important okay we're going to start with one of the first basic Corrections and that's the high hip understand that a high hip for the most part is nothing more than a pelvic rotation or a pelvic torque so we're going to demonstrate that and then I'm going to show you the correction and then we're going to show you the results of the correction stand up for me so what you do is you come midline put your hand middle the hip middle of the hip and what you see in this case is we've got a high right hip is what commonly I find in my office but most people have one side higher than the other okay go face up on the table for me so we got a real easy what I call a self-correction so if the right hip is the high hip the right leg is the long leg therefore the left hip is the low hip and this is the short leg so the correction is always to the low hip or the short leg side so bend your knee let your leg go sideways straighten your leg Bend sideways straighten your leg do that ten times so this is one method to improve that rotated pelvis or the high hip there's a second method which I'm going to show you in a second again the high hip is the side that typically rotates forward so the hip has gone anterior and the reason it's high is because of the shape of the hip so when it rotates forward the bone is a little bit elevated so if this part of the hip rotates that brings that up and that's why the that hip going forward is actually the high hip and in this case the long leg second correction for the same thing we use blocks you can use a pair of shoes you can use your hands or your fists in the same position so the low hip gets the high block the high hip gets the low block so you can lay like this for 10 minutes you can impulse here and just put pressure but essentially this method does the same thing as moving your leg to the side I find moving the leg to the side to the low hip side is just faster but this works really good especially if you're in lots of pain so we're going to get her to stand back up we're going to look at the hips to see if we've now got a corrected hip go ahead and stand up for me okay so now we're going to come back to the hips again midline come down midline come down and now we've got a level hip that right hip is now self corrected so that's how you self correct your hip when we're talking to get on with the short leg in the long leg common commonly you're going to see a difference in the feet of about half an inch to three-quarters of an inch if there's only a slight difference in the leg length or the hip height this next correction works really well and what it does is it unlocks the sacrum so this is just simple modification of a yoga move bring your knee to your chest kind of grab that knee just gently pull relaxed do the other one same thing good so do this ten times on each side is a great additional move to the high hip correction and basically unlocks the sacrum which allows that sacrum to move when you walk so I liked it for the amount of times the amount of time this takes ten times each legs always alternating it's quick quick quick it's a great addition to the high hip move thanks for watching we know these exercises will help you we hope you will like us and comment on our videos as you send them to your friends you deserve to feel good",

        "video_title": "Progressive Eye Disease Keratoconus: How to Treat It",
        "video_sub_title": "- And Dr. Brian I know you're an advocate for this. Just two days ago that Raife had the procedure? - Yes, it went great. And the Holcomb C3-R, the way it works to treat keratoconus. And just to talk a moment about keratoconus is it's a degenerative disease of the cornea, which is the outer lens or windshield of the eye and it's bulging out. And that's why if left untreated it can cause a lot of vision problems. Glare and halos, difficulty driving. It can rob people the ability just to lead a normal life. So the way the procedure works is we have the vitamin application that gets soaked into the cornea noninvasively. We don't have to scrape the cornea or anything invasive like that. And then we lock it in with a special type of light that activates the solution to make the collagen in cornea strong again. It's a 30 minute procedure and painless and just a one day recovery. So when we saw Raife back yesterday he was back to 100% normal routine again which is amazing for a procedure. (audience applauding) - Raife, how are you feeling, bud? - Good. - Vision good? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Now I understand that you're big into sports. - Yeah. - You excited to get the seasons going and have good vision? - Yeah, I'm really excited for the contacts. I can wear contacts now which is gonna be fun. - What's your favorite sport? - Wrestling. - Wrestling? (audience applauding) I wouldn't want to wrestle you. (audience laughing) You know, when you talk about something like this I'm curious you've done the treatment now and obviously Raife has a lot of growing up to do what's the future look like in terms of Raife's vision? - It is so bright because we caught the keratoconus at a really early stage which is ideal. And the success rate of Holcomb C3-R Crosslinking is 99.3% and we've been doing this now for 15 and a half years. So the future, like I said, it's great for him. He's gonna be able to confidently, and with Megan too and the rest of the family, know that his keratoconus is not gonna end up robbing him of any vision loss in the future. And he'll never have worry about a cornea transplant, which is like the best news. - Incidentally this was all possible thanks to the Giving Vision Steven Holcomb Legacy Foundation. If you want to donate to the Giving Vision we're gonna have info on our website. And in that vein, Raife, did you feel your uncle in spirit when you were going through this? - I did. It helped that I was thinking about that because I was kind of scared at first, but when I started doing it, it wasn't that bad. - And Dr. Brian I remember when you were last on the show with Steven it was pretty clear that you two had developed a pretty special relationship. - It had been 10 years since I first treated him when he passed away. And over those years our relationship really went from doctor/patient to friend/friend because of the interaction and the special bond we had. I was at the Olympics in 2014, even in Sochi, when it was so dangerous, the State Department warned everybody, don't go, it's too dangerous. And I went because I just felt in my heart, I just had that gut feeling, I had to be there to support him. And over the years he actually even became a very dear family friend. And that last week before he passed away he stayed at our home with my twin daughters and my wife and just became part of our family. Going out to the movies with the kids and just playing in the pool in the backyard. And he fell in love with our dog, Roxy, too. He just loved our dog, Roxy. - Well, Raife and you said, just a good guy. And what do you want people to remember about your brother, Megan? - That Steven was so much bigger than bobsled. He's known for all of his world championships and his Olympic medals but he wanted to give so much more. He wanted to help people. And this foundation he's helping so many people and giving so many people an opportunity they otherwise wouldn't have, like Raife. - Well his loss was felt by the entire nation. I can tell you when I met him his humility, and you mentioned good guy, it was just apparent that he was a very special person. We were all blessed to have met him. Raife, the one thing I will say is in many ways I believe that this all happened for a reason. Steven laid the ground work for you to hopefully have a lifetime of great vision and hopefully many others. Thank you for sharing your story with us, buddy.",

        "video_sub_title": "hi my name is kara and I'm a student pharmacist and in this video I'll be showing you how to properly administer insulin using a syringe so before you can actually begin your injection you need to make sure that you have all the materials so of course you're you would need your insulin I'm you need the syringe you would need some alcohol pads at least to a sharps disposal container to get rid of your needle after you inject the needle and then optional is a band-aid just in case you want to put one on after you're done so for this video instead of injecting myself with insulin I'm going to be using some salt water but the same ideas apply so the first step is you need to take an alcohol pad and just take one swipe across the top of the vial while that dries you can take the caps off of the needle which off of the plunger and off of the needle alright and so for this example I'm going to be using 20 units of insulin but the amount of insulin that you'll be that you need to take will be different depending on what your doctor prescribes you in this case I'll just do 20 so need to pull back the plunger until the black line lines up exactly with the 20 unit mark you'll need to fill the syringe with air the same amount that you would be injecting yourself with insulin so that you can equalize the pressure inside the vial and outside the vial so that it won't make it hard to pull up the insulin when you're actually pulling the insulin into your cirrage alright so now that i've done this i will you can just inject the needle with the bevel up at a 90 degree angle and inject the air to the vile now you can flip over the vile and you can pull your pull down the syringe until you reach the 20 unit mark and there's usually air bubbles but this is an easy thing to fix and it's also a good idea to get rid of air bubbles so that you don't displace some of the volume of insulin with air because then that means you might not be getting the right amount of insulin so to do this you could just flick with your thumb or whichever finger bebe is until the air bubble escapes sometimes it's kind of tricky all right so once you've done this then you can flip back over the bottle so so after you have pulled up your 20 units of insulin then you can temporarily because you haven't injected it yet you can use the scoop method and then just carefully place the needle back inside the cap while you take another alcohol pad and then you want to wipe down an area of your abdomen or wherever the injection site is just wipe it once with alcohol and you can use other sites besides the abdomen however this is the most common site you'll just want to make sure to pick an area that is at least 2 inches outside a 2 inch radius outside of your belly button so while that dries going to get the meat already all right so now that you're ready to do the injection you can take your needle and then grab the same fold of fat that you previously wipe with alcohol all right and so whenever you're ready just quickly inject on the count of three using a dart like motion using it that fast motion will reduce the amount of pain if that you will feel alright so here we go one two three let go of the fat push the plunger down slowly and then remove the needle and then dispose of the needle and sharps container and take a cotton ball and press it right over the injection site for at least five seconds just to make sure that the insulin doesn't come back out all right and then optionally you can put a bandaid on afterward all right so i can give you a few tips to prevent painful injections the first would be you can use room temperature insulin you don't have to have you don't have to use refrigerated insulin that will just make it more painful also when you're doing the injection even though it's with a needle and that can kind of you know make you a little bit scared just try to relax your muscles that will help prevent some of the pain also it's better to use a sharp needle because if you use a dull needle then when you're entering the skin it's just it's not going to easily go in and so you can reuse needles however just keep this in mind if you want to prevent a painful injection and then the last tip would be that even though it might seem scary to do it just inject yourself quickly because the faster you do it the faster you get that and if you feel anything at all then the faster you get it over with and that will actually make it an easier and less painful injection alright I hope this has been helpful thank you",

        "video_sub_title": "hey beauties welcome back today we are going to be doing a video on how I apply my liquid lipstick perfectly well perfectly for me now liquid lipsticks are all the rage so yes let me show you exactly what I do first we're starting off with a lip scrub guys this is essential if you're a base of your lips they're cracked dry dry skin and liquid lipsticks just not going to work I just mix sugar and honey mix them together and scrub it all over my lips just like an exfoliate honey exfoliate the lips I'm telling you this is going to make a huge difference and this takes literally like it adds an extra two minutes to your routine just go whip some up real quick mix and do this the night before as well if like you have an event or something like that and you want to ensure the perfectness of your liquid lipstick then do this step it's amazing and it tastes good then you're going to want to take a warm washcloth or a paper towel like I did and just rub off the excess and here are my nice dry flake free lips and then this Eucerin aquaphor is amazing it's a drugstore affordable chapstick brand I wear this every night before I go to bed during the day while I wear my lipstick and this Murad is also another secret weapon for this video I know this isn't sponsored mirror I didn't tell me to feature this so I just absolutely love it and before I apply that though I make sure to align my lips and I feel like lip lining is one of the crucial steps because with the applicators on most liquid lipsticks you can't get into those tiny crevices so you're going to want to line your lips that way when you do do the liquid lipstick you won't struggle so bad with trying to get into those inner corners you know what I mean and this also adds just another base to your lips to make the liquid lipstick stick to I find that they last longer when I have a lip liner on and so that's what I'm doing here and just flying them slowly make sure you make them perfect or however you want to line them and the collagen infusion me red lip what is it the Murad rapid collagen infusion for lips what this does is it basically fills in those lines on your lips not all the way they're not going to disappear or anything but you can totally tell a difference when you use this then when you don't use it and you're just going to want to apply a thin layer and you're going to see me I kind of add just a little bit extra just because I feel like I have larger lips and you see those crevasses that I have I like to Pat that in there and make sure that I write my lips with it and then this kind of takes a second to dry so after you apply it all over your mouth like this you're going to want to let it sit and kind of like soak into your lips I guess you could say I make it dry a little bit on my lips and once that is dried set onto your lips that's when you're going to go in with your liquid lipstick you're going to find by using that it's going to make your liquid lipstick just glide onto your lips I'm using colourpop's deeper and if you've used color pops it's not the most moosie like for example comparing it to the Ophir cosmetics liquid lipsticks how you see those are by applying this Murad lip infusion first it just makes it move on there amazingly especially if you have a ton of the colour-pop ultra matte lips this is going to make such a difference and if you use other matte lipsticks they're just it's amazing I'm telling you and yes you can see the fine lines on my lips but that's that's going to happen with liquid lipstick but if I didn't use this it's just this just makes a huge difference and it would look much worse if we didn't exfoliate our lips but yes that is exactly how I apply my liquid lipsticks I get questions all the time on how I what steps I do first before I apply it and yes that is what I do this Murad lip treatment works for any lip products not just liquid lipsticks I just find that I can see the way that it works much better when I do use the liquid lipsticks and then I just go in with the lip liner just to make it more perfect and you know this is optional if you wanted even more and yeah see that's the complete look you guys again I know you can see the fine lines but it's much less severe than if I didn't use it okay I hope you guys enjoy thanks for watching bye you",

This is what we're going to do here in the video this technique where you have a nice braid in the middle and then beads along the side here is another example but this is a round braid an eight warp braid with beads. We have another video on how to do this on beadaholique.com and then I want to show you what is the standard ten warp flat braid looks like and that's this bracelet right here that I'm wearing so this is the focus of our project here in the video and I've gone ahead and I've used Super Lon and I used size 8/0 seed beads I've preloaded my bobbins already, so I've wound my bobbins and I got beads on it already. I have also attached a kumihimo weight through the center I've got these ten strands knotted and when you're doing this particular braid the ten warp you start with six strands up top and four at the bottom for this pattern I decided to do the for bottoms in this dark purple and then the teal color is the six at the top and have corresponding beads if you're not familiar on how to wind your bobbins, how to go ahead and put your strands on a kumihimo plate we do have other videos on kumihimo on beadaholique.com showing you how to do all that to start you're not going to use the beads. I'm going to start doing the standard ten warp braid take the five over to the lower case e on the side and take the six to the uppercase E on the left side then you're going to take the fifteen up to the five the four down to the fifteen fourteen to the four and the three to the fourteenth so we've just done half of our plate. Now do the other side and work our way to the right so the sixteen is going to go to the six the seven is going to go down to the sixteen the seventeen is gonna go to the seven and the eight is going to go to the seventeen and bring our sides back, so we need the e to go back up to the eight and that other E, the uppercase go up to the three. You'll notice now we've done a full circle and we've arrived at six again at the top and four again at the bottom. We're going to repeat that same pattern over. So we're gonna go with the five to the lowercase e and six to the uppercase E starting on the left side, so the fifteen to the five the four down to the fifteenth. Work our way over fourteen up to the four work our way over and three down to the fourtheen so the left side is done and sixteen up to the six, just move on over take the seven down to the sixteen move over seventeen to the seven and then the eight to the seventeen need to bring our threads back to their original position, the lowercase e goes up to the eight the uppercase E goes up to the three and this here's what we're doing, it's a standard ten warp flat kumihimo braid I'm going to do a little bit more and then I'll show you how to add beads so I've done a little bit and I've got this amount started here at the base and now when you're gonna finish your kumihimo flat braid cord ends which we have another video for. You need to be able to have enough you're going to be able to sew this like a straight line, a straight stitch to sew your cords together so they don't unravel and detach the ribbon crimp end to it so as long as you've got enough to do that you're ready to add beads to add your beads we're only going to be adding beads on the side strands, we're never going to add beads on these top and bottom strands. So that's how we're gonna create this where you've got the nice braid in the middle and the beads just along the edges take the lowercase e but before we move it up to the eight drop a bead and move over do the sane on the other side drop a bead and move over, if you're familiar with the round braid where you're used to catch those beads under the threads it is going to actually catch it for you when you continue on your braiding so you don't have to about that, they can just be loose like that we're going to proceed as normal I'm going to move our threads over in the same pattern as if there weren't any beads there at all so the fifteen to the five four to the fifteen fourteen to the four and three to the fourteen and look at what just happened this caught there which is exactly what you want do the right side the sixteen to the six the seven to the sixteen, seventeen to the seven and the eight to the seventeen now this one popped up so what you want to do is take your nail if that happens just slip it under there, make sure that stays so now do the exact same thing again our side thread just move that down don't worry about catching it under anything do the same on the other side and now just braid it as usual those are both caught so we're good to go, add another bead just drop it down there move it along same with the other side so you kind of see we have going here, you see that they're along the edge. So I'm just going to do some braiding here for a little bit and then I will show you what I've got so you can see how it progresses and then what I'll show you how to add just a few more so that you get the technique down and then you can go ahead and braid as long as you want. You can make a short bracelet or you make a necklace, anything that you like so I've braided a little bit more and I just want to show you what we have going here so here's the initial braid we did that we're gonna stitch into, will be able to attach our ends and finish the piece you can see iI have the beads on the side and this is what it looks like, you see how that's arching I'm going to do a little bit more. I want to show  you a top down view as well I'm going to do one more so you can see it again. The side panel I'm going to have those ones be the ones with the beads and then we're just going to do our normal flat braid see how that's criss-crossing. That's what forming that nice design down the middle That was not a bead to go in there. It just slipped away and I just scooted it back towards the bottom all right I will do one more because I want to make sure you get this down just drop it in there you see how that's just feeding through. You got those beads along the side and just do a normal braiding technique if one pops up just make sure that it stays down there, if this was a side panel which that one was coax it under that little thread bridge and there we go so you'll just continue on as long as you want it to be and then if you do you wanna make this exact bracelet it is on beadaholique.com under our free projects in the bracelet section and that has a little magnetic clasp.

        "video_sub_title": "hi guys and welcome back to my youtube channel today I'm sharing with you one of my favorite recipes it is homemade healthy granola [Music] now the null is probably one of my most favorite breakfast I think because it's crunchy its gooey you can kind of mix that was whatever fresh fruit you like it sits there in the cupboard and just like back into you down good morning I don't know that I've got a serious love side of Manila and it is so easy to make we spend so much money on granola and so much canola have so much added sugar into it and it's so easy to make and you don't even need to add in that sugar so we're just going to start off by mixing lots of dry ingredients together so we've got some folks and you can use porridge oats or rolled oats completely up to you how you like it what you've got in your cupboard and to that we're going to mix in some pumpkin seeds and also some sunflower seeds a Popkin seeds are so good food I've got loads loads linking them so you get like acne or any skin problems our people can see and then also we going to add in some pecans which give it a nice good crunch and we're going to mix it all together so this is the kind of dry ingredients the base of it then in a pan we're going to mark down some coconut oil and we're going to mix this once it's melted through all the dry ingredients and then we'll add in some cinnamon for a little bit of flavor that adds in some sweetness and mix it all together so the coconut oil makes it a little bit sticky and it kind of helps give it that crunch and makes some of the nuts and oats become like clusters and these classes are the things to have ingre noir you always want a bit of crunchy cluster now if you want to make this sweeter you could Adamson mister sir if you get up some dry fruit but I'm trying to cut down on my sugar levels and I actually don't think you need it so this is it now the oven is preheated at 170 degree and I'm just going to pop this into a roasting tray make sure it's quite flat if you've got too much granola in your roasting tray you can just put it into two but the key is that it's got lots of space around it it's not kind of clustered together and that's going to make it really nice and crispy so put it in the oven for 10 minutes and then we'll take it out and just give it a stir you know make sure that it's getting through evenly put it back in for another five minutes and then it's ready to go we'll leave it to cool and that's key if you don't let it cool you just chuck it into the top of my container why it's still hot it can the nuts can become a little bit moist which we do so allow it to completely cool and then you can put it into an ice container - now this granola is going to last about a week in a container but trust me you're only having it every day it might be gone before that so I love topping my granola with some almond milk and then some fresh fruit you can like sprinkle it over some like poached rhubarb which is always good it's really good if you like to take your breakfast to work which is you can just take that in a little software container and then just add some milk when you get to work it's really transportable so delicious so so easy to make so why not give it a go I'm going to put all the full description of the recipe and all the measurements and everything like that down below in the description box so guys get stuck into this recipe whip it up so easy so delicious perfect way to start your day make sure you subscribe to my channel give me a big thumbs up I'll see you next time bye you",

        "video_sub_title": "hey its Jessa and welcome to my youtube channel today I'm going to show you how I like to do my French manicures at home to save a little bit of cash instead of going to the nail salon we get started here's what you'll need clear nail polish white nail polish and this is optional but I always like to use sparkly nail polish underneath lastly you'll need some regular tape so let's get started alright so the first thing you're going to want to do is take your sparkly nail polish and coat each of your nails with one layer of sparkly nail polish if you don't want to have the sparkly nails and you want more of a natural look I would ko all of your nails with a coat of clear nail polish once your sparkly nails are dried then you can start taking your clear nail polish and do one smooth coat over the sparkles you if you have a nail dryer I would suggest using that to speed up the process a little bit make sure you don't move on to the next step until your nails are completely dry or else the tape will take the sparkly nail polish off parts your nail and ruin your manicure when your nails finally dry now you're ready for the next step first you're going to take your tape and just take like a medium-sized you know nothing too big just enough to cover your nail I'm going to start with my index finger I'm going to start by placing the tape right where the white part of my nail meets the pink and I'm going to try and get right about on that line as exactly as I can it should end up looking about like this if you don't naturally have long nails you can fake it by lowering the tape farther down on your nail to make the illusion that the white tip of your nail is longer than it actually is before you move on to the next step make sure that you press the tape down on each finger making sure that it's completely against your nails now all you have to do is simply paint over the tape with the white nail pop make sure the whole front tip of your nail is covered and don't worry about getting white paint on the tape that's going to come off later you it's crucial that you wait a long time until they dry because if you take the tape off too soon the white paint will peel off with it if you wait long enough and let the white paint dry the tape with the white paint on it will come off leaving you a straight line white tip once the nail polish is dried you can start removing the tape remove it slowly and carefully if you see that any white paint is starting to come up as you take the tape off that means you haven't waited long enough for the white nail polish to dry so I'd wait another five minutes or so this is what it should look like you now it's time to simply recoat your nails one more time with your clear nail polish you and there you go thank you guys so much for watching I hope you guys enjoyed this film and comment if you have any questions or suggestions for other videos and please subscribe to my channel see you guys later",

        "video_sub_title": "so first I want to have a little chat about just why hot mobile people tend to get more pain than others and this took me a little while to kind of understand and it wasn't something that I learned even when I was at university going through my physiotherapy degree I found it really frustrating at the time because I was experiencing a lot of back pain but whenever I saw anyone about it they said but you're really flexible you're really strong we don't understand why you're getting pain so I wanted to explain a little bit especially around the spine but this goes for just about every other joint in your body as well so when we have a normal spine we have our bones and then there are ligaments around each of the joints that help control it in place a little then we have a deep layer of what we call postural muscles now these are muscles that are designed to work at a low intensity for a long period of time and they help control our position in space overlying those we have our bigger movement muscles which are designed to create bigger movements of the body now if everything's working well people can move around life where they're not too much thought and without getting too much pain that's because most people then ligaments are stable enough to stop the spine moving excessively unfortunately if you have have mobility syndrome then you tend to have excessive movement this creates a lot more movement at each level and the subtle control of those deep stabilizing muscles becomes far more important and I've discovered we need to do a lot more programming to make sure that those deep stabilizing muscles are doing their job they can help act as dynamic ligaments if you like which means that their stability of the spine is increased by muscular control not necessarily that ligamentous stability now the reason why so many people with excessive mobility get pain as if they have mobile ligaments the deep stabilizing back muscles aren't working very well all of the load goes into the big movement muscles now physiologically these muscles are designed to contract for movement and then relax they're not designed to hold on for long hair of time so if you are sitting for a long period and especially if you're trying to sit up straight these muscles will get over recruited they will get fatigued and then they'll start creating pain in order to get you to move away from that position so what we're going to do today is have a look at how we can get those little baby back muscles to work and how you can sit for long periods without experiencing that pain",

You need to expel the foreign object. Kneel or sit with the infant in your lap. Hold the infant face down. Support the infant's head and jaw with your hand. Rest your forearm on your lap or your thigh to support the infant. Deliver 5 back blows forcefully between the infant's shoulderblades using the heel of your hand. Deliver each blow with sufficient force to attempt to dislodge the foreign body. After delivering 5 back blows, place your free hand on the infant's back, supporting the back of the infant's head with the palm of your hand. With the palm of the other hand, support the infant's head and turn the infant as a unit. Hold the infant face up. Keep the infant's head lower than the rest of the body. Provide five quick downward chest thrusts in the middle of the chest over the lower half of the breastbone. Deliver chest thrusts at a rate of about one per second, each with the intention of creating enough force to dislodge the foreign body. Repeat the sequence of 5 back blows and 5 chest thrusts until the object is removed or the infant becomes unresponsive.",

        "video_sub_title": "oh it's the salk foot anything can happen when alpine climbing even if you're super careful and thoroughly prepared even though we all know how helpful emergency equipment is in the event of an accident unfortunately not every climber will have the necessary equipment with them falling rocks or falling yourself are just a couple of examples of what can happen when alpine climbing every mountain climber should have a minimum supply of first-aid equipment with them including an aluminum rescue blanket a triangular bandage equipment for treating wounds and a small assortment of adhesive bandages it's important to bring a well-organized first-aid kit which will help when treating the patient if I notice when climbing that an accident has happened maybe that someone's been injured by falling rocks or has fallen themselves then of course I'll want to help them as quickly as possible but before I start I should take a moment to consider well I put myself in danger if I rush to help and then I should ensure that I get the injured person out of the danger area as quickly as possible before you treat bleeding wounds for example with a pressure dressing you should always put on protective gloves a pressure dressing is best for stemming heavy bleeding you should first lay or sit the patient down then you should place a sterile dressing directly onto the heavily bleeding wound wrap a gauze bandage around once or twice to secure the wound then place a second standard bandage on top this works as a pressure pad you should then wrap it again with a gauze bandage there is a trick to this if you turn the gauze bandage directly over the wound through 180 degrees this reduces the surface area and provides actual pressure directly onto the wound then you can simply continue to wrap the gauze bandage around when the pressure dressing has been set up you should check blood flow monitor activity and sensitivity in the extremities simply check whether both hands are as warm as each other whether the injured person has full feeling and can still move their fingers if the first pressure dressing becomes saturated with blood a second pressure dressing can be placed over the first one if there are signs of shock such as cold sweating and paleness as a result of significant blood loss you can place the injured person in the shock position for example elevate their legs if they lose consciousness as a result of significant blood loss you should then inspect their airway by listening looking and feeling if they are breathing the patient should be placed in the stable recovery position and repeatedly evaluated using the ABC system if you head to the mountains you'll feel more confident if you know that you can help an injured person and provide first aid in the event of an accident by implication this means you should prepare and practice these first aid measures in the same way you'd practice setting up a belay or your partner's belay correctly during a climb",

        "video_sub_title": "everyone and today I'm going to be showing you a DIY on mermaid bath salt and what you'll need to create these is Epsom salt coarse sea salt essential oil dried roses and dried lavender and also a glass container to store everything in I'm gonna start off by pouring my Epsom salt into a measuring cup you'll need one cup to create about two small jars of some salt scrub I'm showing here that I'm using one cup and we'll also be taking one cup of course you saw later on now the thing else you saw since you can also buy it and colored now the one that's on the little pamphlet where I got the recipe is from Black Milk and they used light lavender and dark purple and sea salts it would really create a really pretty effect but I just have natural color and I mix the two salts together and now I'm having my essential oil which is one teaspoons this is vanilla but you can use any fragrance you want I'm also shaking a little bit extra and there just to get a very strong MLS side mixing that up to create an even mixture and now I'm adding my dried roses this is one tablespoon and I'm adding my dried Basinger this is one tablespoon as well and you want to mix this together just to make sure everything is evenly just should be dead I'm also sprinkling a little bit of dried lavender and dried roses into the mixture just to get a little bit more of the dried flowers into the salt and once again you'll want to mix anything that you add to your cells now I'm taking the two glass containers a mason jar and an empty candle jar that is ageless to drive and I'm going to be pouring a mixture into these containers it's easier to keep salt fresh when it's in glass rather than when it's in plastic and you can even get one of those cute little spoons to keep inside the jar so when it's bath time it's easy to pour salt into your water all I'm doing is to my table spoon and pouring salt inside and trying to do a pretty evenly distribution into both jars one of them's bigger obviously but I'd still wanted to have enough to give one away and then you want to make sure you see all these tightly with the lady and make sure you're not wasting any of the salt I ordered all my ingredients on Amazon but I definitely would recommend going to a craft store because it definitely will be cheaper in the store about the economy or shipping and having to buy way too many lavender and rose buds just make sure you seal these tightly so they last a long time and I hope you guys enjoyed this DIY leave comments down below and I hope you guys have an awesome amazing fantastic day",

        "video_sub_title": "hey guys so you probably notice something about where I am I am filming in my bathroom so what the sound is not very good that is why but this video is going to be involving being in bathroom so I had to be in here sorry guys I've been wanting to do this video because summer is coming up as you guys all know and I'm probably so excited about I know I am but with summer comes shaving your legs yeah shaving your legs is not fun especially if you live in Minnesota and it's kind of gross but I think a lot of us do not shave our legs in the winter months because winter is so long and you're wearing sweatpants and like long pants and all these things covering your legs unless you have like a wedding or something to go to that's inside you don't really shave your legs I know that's super gross and some of you might think it's gross to show hairy legs but hey it is the reality it guys women have hairy legs too and we have to shave it whatever just like men shave their face women have to shave their legs I am going to show you guys what I have been using for shaving my legs because it's a little bit different I mean it's not like revolutionary or anything but it's something that I have been realizing is a really good way to shave your legs and it is using your husbands or boyfriend's shaver this is an electric shaver it's a Philips Norelco I think that's how you say it it's got three blades and what's really cool is that mint shavers are meant to get super close and get a lot of the hair off because on a man's face it's really rough hard hair on their face and so you have to really shave too get that up at least my husband does me it's really thick dark beard hair so this works really well for him to get extra clothes so I was just thinking one day I'm like I'm just gonna use your shaver to get it off the reason why I started using my husband shaver is because this little baby um is not working as well for me anymore and I didn't feel like going and buying a new motor or battery or whatever this is battery operated so you have just those two um triple A's in there and yeah I just didn't want to replace it so I was like hey my husband has this here maybe it'll work so I just started shaving my legs with this razor and or with the shaver and it was so so good nothing can get all the hair off like using one of these but so I have a combination I use of these so I use this first and my legs are dry and it's like after I've showered and my legs are dry then I use this and it gets most of the leg hair off and then after that I go in with my regular shaver but this could not get as close as this does on the first round so I just literally I'll show you guys in this clip and if you're grossed out by it I'm sorry but I felt like it was necessary and then a lot of women are probably wondering hmm does my husband shaver work as well as mine if not better and I'm going to show you guys how well it works so here we go okay so I guess I was not filming when I first started doing this adventure but I don't know if you can tell I really hope you can but I used a shaver on just this bottom part so far and this is like some real turn maneuvering angle to use a shaver and it got a lot of the hair off if you can see the comparison it really really got a lot of it off there is still a little bit of I don't know if you call it stubble but a little bit something still there which the woman's razor we get the rest off but it got really super close I wonder if we can zoom in and you can see oh this is so hard I see a difference and so I just can't I just keep shaving in this here I'll show you guys but so I just took the razor the shaver well the electric shaver and just went in circular motions around now let's see if it'll show you how everything comes off so you just do it in circular motions and hopefully you can see that a lot of hair is coming off just put some pressure on it and circular motions work your way up and it gets a lot of hair off like my razor does not get all the hair off and I think that what's awesome about the electric shaver is that you can get around all the curves of your leg but let's brush that off it's meant for a man's face so it will get around the curves and things like that so you just really go in circular motions around go by my legs are extra sensitive so when I do use a regular razor it really hurts my legs like even if I use like the sensitive like no fragrance no anything shaving cream it still irritates my legs so this really works really well to get most of the hair off and so then when I use the regular shaver I'm not having to use it as much to get all the hair off because I'm using this method so it's really good enough oh my legs are disgusting sorry as you can see there is no hair there's just little little things here and there but it got a lot of the hair off and it does feel pretty smooth you know it doesn't feel like if you use to regular shaver just like this it's like like butter but this really does get a lot of the hair off so you can regular shave see the disgusting leg boom so sorry is so gross but that is how easy it is to get all of that hair off ends up looking like this crazy crazy so I'm sorry if that grossed you out it's kind of like should I do this video but I'm doing it for the benefit of you guys if you try your husband or boyfriends or brothers whatever electric shaver you might find that as your new favorite way to shave your legs especially if you're in a hurry and you don't have time to like do the whole shaving cream and use your woman's razor and it takes forever and if you know nobody's going to be touching your legs like it's like I'm married so I know that we're kind of out of that area like nobody really touches my legs except for me so it's a really good fast way to get most of the hair off and it looks like you really shaved I don't know that's just me I just kind of wanted to share this little tip with you guys just in case you wanted to know because when I found it out I was like this is amazing maybe other women don't know I don't know so I thought that would be helpful for you guys so the razor that I that my husband uses is a Philips Norelco and it's it looks like this it's got three blades and has this little thing I guess it's for doing their beard I don't really know I don't use it but it's got a nice little charger if anybody cares but I mean just try it try your husbands or boyfriends or brothers shaver I guess and see if you like it and see if it works for your legs it works for mine so thought I would just share that with you guys so that your legs can start to get a little bit ready for summer and for swimsuits cuz that's coming up crazy fast I can't believe it but I'm gonna definitely work out because I know that my legs are terrible and flabby but yeah I did it all for you guys so thanks for watching guys I hope you enjoyed this video if you did

Number one, any infant or child who has a dog bite needs to be seen by a doctor. Very important they need to be checked out. Anybody who has a bite needs to be evaluated for skin damage, bone damage, underlying tissue damage, tendon damage, nerve damage, even if there's no break in the skin. Number one; get yourself away from the dog. Get you and the person to safety. Number two, if it's bleeding, stop the bleeding. Put some pressure on the wound with a clean cloth, with some gauze, and stop the bleeding. Call your doctor, or go to your doctor. You're going to need to know what type of animal it was, any kind of markings, any coloring where you were, even if you don't know what kind of animal it was. All the information can help your doctor figure out what the next step is. You especially need to seek medical treatment if the animal was wild, an animal you don't know, if the animal was sick or acting in a way that may be sick, aggressive behavior, be behavior that's not normal for this dog. If you think the animal might be poisonous it's very important to get to the doctor right away to get that checked out. There may be things happening that you don't see right away that a doctor can help you with. And that's what to do in a bite.",

        "video_title": "Hypothyroidism | Under-Active Thyroid | What All Patients Need to Know",
        "video_sub_title": "if you or someone you know has been diagnosed with an underactive thyroid this video is for you my name is dr hart pinto i'm a doctor in the uk and i would like to talk to you about underactive thyroid or as doctors call it hyperthyroidism we will look at what is an underactive thyroid and what causes it are there any risk factors for getting an underactive thyroid what are the symptoms of hypothyroidism and how is it diagnosed how will your underactive thyroid be treated and what are the problems if my underactive thyroid isn't treated so what is an underactive thyroid and what causes it your thyroid gland is a small butterfly-shaped gland that lives in the neck just in front of your windpipe the main function is to help regulate your body's metabolism it does this by releasing two hormones try eodothione t3 and thyroxine t4 in some people the levels of these hormones are too low this is something that can happen at any age babies are even tested at five days old and this forms part of the blood spot tests that community midwives perform babies who are found to have low thyroid levels from birth are given the name congenital hypothyroidism an underactive thyroid can be caused by chronic autoimmune thyroiditis this is a condition where the body's own immune system which normally combats infection attacks the thyroid gland this damages the thyroid and as a result it cannot produce enough of the thyroid hormones the most common form of this is known as hashimoto's thyroiditis this can sometimes run in families and may be linked to other autoimmune conditions it can also occur post-treatment for hyperthyroidism where people have received radioactive iodine treatment or even after surgical removal a poor dietary intake of iodine can be a rare cause of underactive thyroid in order for the thyroid to make effective levels of thyroxine it requires iodine a special gland in your brain also plays an important role in helping regulate your thyroid function this is called a pituitary gland it secretes a hormone called tsh thyroid stimulating hormone in patients with tumors of this gland levels of tsh can fall leading to a reduction in the amount of thyroxine the thyroid makes this cause of hypothyroidism is very rare certain medications can also have a negative effect on thyroid function including amiodarone which is a medication used to treat heart arrhythmias lithium a mood stabilizer interferons which are medication used to treat viral inflammation of the liver and some types of cancers are there any risk factors for getting an underactive thyroid underactive thyroid is relatively common it is more commonly found in women and those over the age of 60 years as mentioned before this condition can sometimes run in families and may also be present in individuals with other autoimmune conditions such as type 1 diabetes so what are the symptoms you might experience if you're hypothyroid everyone's symptoms are different but many people will complain of feeling tired all the time experiencing persisting low mood or poor memory and inability to tolerate the cold they may notice that they have cold hands some people may complain also of pain numbness or pins and needles in the hands and the fingers this may indicate the development of a condition called carpal tunnel syndrome you may notice that your skin becomes dry your hair becomes brittle and also your nails you may find that you've gained weight have a poor sex drive or develop constipation other patients may complain of muscle aching cramping or weakness you may also notice that your voice changes and may become hoarse and some women may also notice a change in their periods becoming irregular or heavier so how is it diagnosed if your doctor suspects that you have an underactive thyroid they will organize for a blood test to look at the levels of thyroxine produced by the thyroid plus the levels of tsh that's the thyroid stimulating hormone released from the special gland in your brain a diagnosis of hypothyroidism is confirmed by low levels of thyroxine and increased levels of the stimulating hormone tsh this is because your thyroid fails to produce enough thyroxine the thyroid hormone and the special pituitary gland in your brain tries to stimulate the thyroid to produce more much like the driver of a car running out of petrol he presses harder on the accelerator but if there's no petrol the car's not going to go any faster equally the thyroid gland if it's not working effectively is not going to respond to the stimulating hormones tsh in some patients thyroxine levels may be normal but the tsh is still raised this can indicate that there is a developing underactive thyroid if an autoimmune cause is suspected for your underactive thyroid your doctor may look for the presence of a thyroid antibody where present this indicates that the immune system has attacked the thyroid so how will your underactive thyroid be treated if your doctor diagnoses an underactive thyroid they will prescribe you a synthetic thyroxine hormone this is called levothyroxine if you wish to learn more about liver thyroxine why not watch dr jumbocus's video here she explains whether this medication is suitable for you how you should take this medication and the common side effects your doctor will also regularly monitor your thyroid function after starting your medication this is in the form of a blood test from this your doctor can adjust the dose of your levothyroxine to a level that works for you getting your dosing right can sometimes be tricky and sometimes requires a number of adjustments to your dosing it can also take several weeks before you start feeling the benefit from the medication don't forget everybody is different if you're trying to get pregnant or think you might be pregnant make sure you talk to your regular doctor as you may need closer monitoring and dose adjustments if you have an underactive thyroid and are requiring liver thyroxine it's likely you will need to take this medication lifelong so what happens if my underactive thyroid isn't treated if your underactive thyroid is not being treated it places you at risk of developing an increased risk of heart disease this is because patients with low thyroxine levels can develop high levels of bad cholesterol ldl which places you at increased risk for heart attacks and strokes some patients may also complain of a swelling in the neck overstimulation of the underactive thyroid by the tsh hormone produced by the pituitary gland in your brain causes the thyroid to gradually increase in size if it becomes large enough it may be visible and can cause pressure on your wind and food pipes in the neck causing difficulty in breathing and swallowing the nerves which supply your limbs may be damaged resulting in weakness numbness and pins and needles low thyroxine levels as mentioned above can affect your mood and your cognition and this can have a knock-on effect of causing depression or early dementia you may find that your fertility is also affected making it more difficult to become pregnant amongst expecting mothers with an underactive thyroid there is also an increase in babies with birth defects in the worst case scenario you're at risk of developing a condition called myxodemocoma

        "video_sub_title": "[Music] [Music] a t-shirt I'd recommend grabbing a larger size and a serger because we're working on stretchy fabric just a little tip look for the athletic t-shirts because they are look away and this is good material for making a swimsuit so you're gonna want to start by taking in the shirt to your measurements so pin at the waist and at the hips and I definitely recommend grabbing a t-shirt long enough that goes past the hips [Music] [Music] so now that I have these points you're gonna want to make your cut and we're just gonna measure really quick so we get an accurate cut and then we're gonna draw a line vertically all the way across the t-shirt pretty much plan on cutting off the entire arm sleeve all the way up to the shoulder [Music] then go ahead and repeat this process to the other side and a little tip we like to do the same measurements to the other side so that way it stays symmetrical so now you're going to want to put it back on inside out and now we're gonna get a more accurate hitting so you're gonna want to put it in three places at the waist at the hip and at the armpit and then do this for both sides definitely try to take it in as close as you can towards your body [Music] [Music] [Music] so now we're gonna be using those pins as guidelines to help us make that curve and we're gonna be using a French ruler this is a really accurate way to make a solid curve for the shape of the body and then go ahead and do this on both sides and there will be links in the description for all the tools we are using so go ahead and check that out so now go ahead and cut off the access fabric and I would do about a quarter inch seam allowance on this just to give yourself a little bit of play room so if you don't have a serger I recommend using a zig-zag stitch but start at the bottom and start sewing up and around that curve but do not sew the armhole closed and the nice thing about a serger you don't really have to worry about cutting these off because you can just sew and cut and overall it makes for a longer-lasting product so now we're gonna make a mark down the middle and sorry that it's kind of hard to see we're actually gonna go back through a sharpie so it's a little bit easier and this is where we're dropping the neckline down so we're just getting the measurements so you're gonna want to make a mark as low as you go at the bust and then at the top by the neckline and then connect all those points and this doesn't have to be totally accurate just get a basic reference so that way you can go back and measure it and then cut it out so now doing the side we're gonna do the same thing we're gonna start at the shoulder and work our way down and we're just kind of eyeballing this curve see and how we kind of want it to look and then bring it around towards the back and you can totally get creative with these curves drop them as low as you want to go as wide as you want really do whatever and you only have to make these marks on one side so now we're gonna be doing the bottom half again make a mark down the middle and then drop a little bit from that curve on the side and then work towards the middle this is gonna be your like opening so you can curve it in or curve her out as much as you want just remember to not connect it exactly at the middle of the shirt and give yourself some seam allowance because you will want to have all this and do the same for the back curve of the leg opening and you're gonna want to make sure it lines up with the front opening so just measure from the middle and make sure you end up at that point and as you can see our lines are not that perfect but you can go back through with the French curve and straighten all these lines out next we're gonna be cutting just a side curve out then you want to fold your shirt in half and use this curve to trace on the other side and this is why we only draw on one half and then go ahead and cut that curve out the next where we drawn up the back and these are his basic straps so we can tie it above the neckline you can literally make these as far as you want down but now we're gonna start cutting it out and just go a long ear cut line all the way up towards the neckline and around the neckline and then start cutting the back of the neckline off and then work around your back curve that you cut and then repeat this process for the other side and the other side is drawn in its just drawn in with chalk so it's hard to see and then go ahead and try it on and see how it's starting to fit so now we're gonna make a mark across the back and cut off that back flap and you don't have to have the Sun to make this mark we just do it so it's easier to see and kind of get to show you how it's done so now that it's cut off you're gonna kind of want to make sure that it curves up towards the upper half of your body and then for cutting the like opening your your wanna fold it in half with the seams together and then cut around your arch and again make sure your points line up ours were a little bit off so we had to recorrect our curve and then we went ahead and cut it out and then pretty much all you have to do is Serge that end together so take it to your serger or sewing machine and do a surge or a zig zag stitch and next we're gonna be showing you a few different options on how to hem your raw edges if you don't have a serger you can totally just roll it over and do a stitch all the way around it and that's just a basic roll over hem we are actually researching all the raw edges be sure not to trim too much off just get it right on that edge [Music] so as you can see I kind of cleaned up that edge and you can toy just keep it at this.look if you want but we're gonna take a next step further and if you are just gonna keep it at this.look I recommend using thread that matches your fabric it will blend and just look a little bit more professional and then the next technique is using a cover stitch and this is what you see on most of the knit clothing that's in a store the cover stitch allows you to hem the edges but also keep that nice stretch with the garment so you'll be taking those Serge edges rolling them over and stitching all the way around and this adds for a really professional look in this machine you can do a lot with you can do swim suits you can do t-shirts you can do literally any knitwear with this machine in this singer that we're actually using it can be a serger or a cover stitch so I highly recommend checking out this machine in particular because you can go back and forth and not have to spend the money on both a serger and a cover stitch into getting the same color thread as the shirt would really play a big difference on this you can see that we're using black and you can see the stitching but the same color it kind of blends in and really looks nice and then again repeat this process to all the other openings in there you have a beautiful hem and again all the links are in the description go check that out if you're looking for tools and supplies we like to source out the best stuff at the cheapest prices so go ahead and have the rest of the raw openings it's done the exact same way and once you're done hemming your swimsuit is complete and we're gonna be doing more swimsuits coming up here in the future so stay tuned and thanks everyone for watching be sure to like subscribe comment and we'll see you next time [Music]",

        "video_title": "APPLYING CUSTOM INDIVIDUAL FALSE EYELASHES\u23a2HOODED EYES\u23a2Leslie Ann-The Beauty Cop",
        "video_sub_title": "hey guys welcome back to my channel yes I sound a little funny oh but I've had a really bad cold and I wasn't able to film the past few days because I had no voice so today it's a little better and I figured hey I'm also get on here and do this video that I really wanted to do it and was highly requested this is all about applying customized individual eyelashes so if you're interested in seeing that video keep on watching this is so simple and previously I was using the ardell individuals that look like this and they have the little dots on the top and they were ok but they are hard to apply and they took a while for me to get used to so I decided why can't i just take regular false eyelashes and cut them the way I want them play some of my eye and hopefully they stick a little better because they have more of a faith so that's what I did and that's the technique that I've been using and love it I do mention in my demo that i use the kiss lashes in 03 and the reason i use these is because first one length for like whiskey and on my eyelashes I like blue light more life instead of volume I mean if I can get both of you great but I'll take the land over volume having hooded eyes the 03 you can see the longer in the middle and then they take them off shorter on the sides and that's what I like for my foot eyes because it opens my eyes up the other reason I like the old freeze is because they have a clear view a lot of false eyelashes have a black fan and I actually tart another pair that have a lot of fan and they didn't look as natural a stove and IFI these with this clear band you don't see them on out that's why i love that final this technique I just think it looks so natural you don't feel like you have false eyelashes on out they last all that it's so easy and quick it is so much bigger than trying to put these kind of individual false eyelashes off so let's get into the tunnel and I'll be like that again don't mind my voice sounds a little press key and don't mind my little friend here or whatever it is it's a pop-up that I want to film what I am going to be using the Chiss lashes and they are in oh free you can see our already use a set you can use any lashes that you want with this I recommend using a latch that has a thin band and a clear leader right so you're going to need tweezers the eyelashes blue and a pair of scissors so I'm only going to be different because of the shape of your eyes and the size of them but for me in this is through trial and error I found with these eyelashes that if I cut them every third eye lash it what's the best for my eyes and it looks the most natural so what you're going to do you're going to take your eyelash and this might be a little hard to see so I will try to explain it the best I can I'm going to take it and on the third eye lash I'm just going to follow the shape of the eye lashes if I was placing it like this normally what I'm going to do is I'm just going to start cutting from the outside in and placing it where I want I find it's easiest to put glue on something than to take my eyelash directly on the blue and then I can dip it in and I don't seem to get so much on the eyelash so I'm just going to take the eyelash I'm going to dip it in my glue let it dry and blow on it for about a second and then I found using a small mirror is much better replacing false eyelashes because you can get real close and you get closer to your lash line because you can see a closer so I just place that right there and as soon as that glue dries you won't even see it you won't even see where the band is because it just sets right in there so nicely so now what I'm going to do I'm just going to cut every free and place them on my eyes until basically I'm done it and I like the way it looks as you can see I have this I'd done and this or not I mean I think it makes such a difference but I think they look so natural I don't feel at all I don't feel like I'm wearing false eyelashes because they're separated in placed you know a little bit more separated than when you have all one band on your eye so you can spread them out and make on as comfortable as you like and i really like it they don't come up i have to worry about them falling up or lift it on the corners so i'm going to finish my other eye and now we'll be back as you saw in the demo it is so easy just cutting them every few placing on one they separate or where you don't have to move them around you know it dries within a few seconds you don't see them I think it's a very nice look I love how natural it looks but it also looks like are those are real eyelashes I don't know maybe maybe have a good mascara on they last all day they don't bother me I don't feel like I'm wearing false eyelashes this I'm so glad I started doing this instead of using or are they the little individual ones i hope you enjoyed this demo of how I apply false eyelashes just customize me on my way the way I like them if you did please give the video a thumbs up subscribe to your Nexus 5 I'll see in the next one bye guys",

        "video_title": "5 Tips to Prevent Tick Bites and Getting Lyme Disease | Johns Hopkins Medicine",
        "video_sub_title": "[Music] Lyme disease is an infection that's transmitted by ticks and ticks are getting ready to come out now that it's a early spring in summer over 300 thousand new cases of Lyme disease are estimated to occur every year in the United States that makes Lyme disease the most frequent tick for an infection in North America the ticks of transmit Lyme disease the deer ticks are very small and they're very difficult to see they're about the size of a pinhead when they come out in late spring and early summer my name is dr. John akhat I'm an assistant professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and director of the Lyme disease Research Center in the division of Rheumatology I'm here today to talk about the five tips that you can take home and remember on how to prevent tick bites and getting Lyme disease the first tip is create a tick free zone around your house the first principle in creating a tick free zone is avid inner area that is well manicured lawns are they're well known and grafted as well shirred will keep the tick habitats away from your home we want to separate this tick free habitat from the woods with a barrier and often what is used is called a tick barrier which is a several foot wide strip of woodchips or bark that separates your well manicured yard and lawn from the brush and taller grasses that may be around the perimeter of your yard ticks get Lyme disease from mice and so we also want to eliminate the mouse habitats around your yard this would include eliminating wood piles and rock piles with a mice tend to live and breathe gardeners may also want to try to keep deer out of their tick free zone this can be accomplished with an eight-foot deer fence and these can be installed by professionals or by yourself tip number two enjoy the outdoors safely when you're hiking stay on the path and stay in the middle of path away from the high grass and brush that may be on the edges of your hiking trail avoid going into the tall grass and brush when you're hiking because that's where the ticks are it's safe to go to sports and athletic fields with well-groomed grass just stay out of the brush and tall grass at the edges of the fields tip number three protect yourself your children and your pets by wearing protective clothing treated with tick pesticides and treating your skin with agents such as DS these lightweight pants are good for hiking and being long pants they prevent ticks from getting on your skin long shirts are also important again for the same reasons that they prevent ticks from getting on you permit rain is a commonly used tick pesticides it's applied to clothing not to your skin permethrin is a unique chemical because it does not need to be reapplied frequently it actually stays bound in the material of your clothing and needs only be to be reapplied every several months in addition to treating your clothing with permethrin you can also use different products on your skin to repel ticks deed is a commonly used tick repellent that can be applied to the skin safely in adults and children the deep' must be applied every two to three hours in warm weather DEET is easy to apply just by spraying onto the exposed surface of the skin and allowing it to dry in place when you're done enjoying the out-of-doors it's good protective a habit to shower immediately this may wash off ticks it of gotten onto you and to wash and dry your clothes immediately it's also important to protect your your pets from Lyme disease it's important to consult with your veterinarian about approved products for tick repellents for your pets as well it's very important to use protective measures for your children as well any kind of pesticides or repellents should be used with caution and it's important to discuss the use of these with your pediatrician before using them tip number four perform tick checks after coming in from the out-of-doors and showering the most important thing is to get ticks off of you before they attach and after becoming attached to have the to transmit Lyme disease tick checks are performed two ways one is by feeling for ticks because the ticks are very small and sometimes aren't seen by feeling for ticks you can actually discover ticks that may be in hidden areas such as behind your knee or in the axilla where you wouldn't be able to easily see them tick inspections should be done as well looking for the very small pinpoint sized dark specks that are the nymph stage ticks and present at this time of the year especially important areas to check for ticks include behind the knees under the armpits in the scalp and especially in children where ticks tend to be in the scalp along the waistline and in areas of the back where you may need help from somebody to look on your back for ticks tip number five remove ticks once found immediately by grasping them with a tweezer and pulling them off of the skin the quickest way to remove the tick is with a tweezer to grasp the tick between the head of the tick in the skin and to pull firmly but gently away sometimes this will leave behind small black mouth parts of the tick in the skin this is not to worry these small mouth parts do not transmit Lyme disease and should be left alone never try to dig out the mouth parts of the tick with a any type of needle or blade just leave them in place and they will work their way out on their own the most important point is to remove the tick quickly removing a tick in the first 24 hours dramatically reduces the risk of Lyme disease and is your best protection in preventing yourself from getting Lyme disease in conclusion using these five tips to prevent Lyme disease can help you enjoy the outdoors safely help you to avoid tick bites and help you to avoid getting Lyme disease",

        "video_sub_title": "hi and welcome to Eugene speech-language therapy last week we talked in general about what swallowing disorders are if you want to know more about swallowing disorders please watch my other video this week I'm going to give you three exercises and three positioning maneuvers to help someone with dysphasia so speech-language pathologists use swallowing exercises just like other therapists exercise other muscles of the body we can exercise the muscles of the swallow these are effective when an entire comprehensive treatment plan is in place and you're working with a speech therapist sort of start us off three exercises to strengthen the swallow number one this is called the misako and it's commonly used by speech therapists what you do is you put your tongue between your teeth and then you swallow keeping your tongue there the entire time like this number two this is called the mendelssohn maneuver it's quite difficult some people get it right away and some people struggle with it but if you can get it it's a really good exercise so basically when you swallow your Adam's apple or that little notch that you have right here it's gonna pop up so when you swallow food or drinks it's going down and your throat is coming up and if you feel your throat you can feel that knotch go up and then back down but the mendelssohn maneuver does is once you swallow and the food is going down your throat or the saliva is going down you hold the knotch at the top so you swallow and you don't let go and you hold it hold it hold it and while you're holding it it actually is holding your breath because for a moment when you swallow you are holding your breath and that's where the throat position in so you swallow the knotch pops-up you hold it there then you let go hold for three to five seconds the third strengthening exercise and exercise to help with the timing of a swallow is called a supraglottic swallow what you do is right before you swallow you hold your breath and then you swallow then you cough so it has three steps hold your breath swallow and cough now for three positioning maneuvers to help with the swallow but these maneuvers are doing is to help prevent aspiration or food or drink going down the wrong way they help to close off the airway which is very important when you're swallowing the first and most common is called a chin tuck so what you do or what you teach the person to do is when they're ready to swallow after they have some drink in their mouth or they've chew their food before they start to swallow tuck their chin down to their chest kind of like they're giving themselves a double chin as I like to say like that and then you swallow hard and fast keeping your head all the way down and then you can come back up with some patience this is the only way they can swallow safely and you see people doing that if you think about it the general population if they have a big you know amount of food in their mouth and kind of do this anyway to get it down that's because when you drop the head it helps to protect the airway it opens things up in a different way that makes it easier to swallow the second positioning maneuver helps mostly with people who have had a stroke that affects one side of their vocal cords if someone had a stroke and the left side of their body was affected the left side of their head was affected and their left vocal cord was also affected which is very common what you do is when you want to swallow you turn your head to the affected side the side that's not working and then you swallow that essentially when you turn your head cuts off that side of the throat and the food will only go down the good side the last positioning maneuver is a pretty obvious one and that is sitting upright when you eat it's very important to make sure that the person with the swallowing disorder is sitting up at 90 degrees every single time they swallow anything it's easier to do this in a chair but if they happen to be in a bed sit the bed up to 90 degrees or as far as they can go and this greatly reduces the amount of coughing and possible aspiration thank you for watching I hope this helps and look for my other videos on swallowing disorders",

        "video_title": "Understanding Dyscalculia | Common Types of Learning Disabilities | Special Education Teacher",
        "video_sub_title": "hey guys and welcome back to my channel as you know I am the LD educator I am a special education teacher and my goal is to share hope and to dispel myths about special education and those with learning disabilities so we've been doing a little series on the different types of common learning disabilities and today we are talking dyscalculia yeah that's right I know it's a tongue twister but dyscalculia is a specific learning disability in that area of math I also have a simulation tool that I want to share with you guys and it is awesome I will drop a link below so that you can go and check that out matter of fact I encourage every special education teacher every general education teacher and even your parents to experience this because we need to see and we need to be able to experience what our students experience on a daily basis sitting in our classroom and when we're better able to understand what it feels like to actually have dyslexia to have dyscalculia or any other learning disability we will develop a whole new level of empathy and being able to work with our students so make sure you stick around the simulation tool is something that I found online and I simply think it is amazing and so make sure you also share it with your peers okay so before we get started I would like to thank all of the teachers parents and individuals with learning disabilities who have been supporting my channel if you're new here then I invite you to subscribe also click the mail button so you will not miss any of my upcoming videos so this calculator is a lifelong condition that causes a child to have difficulty performing math related tasks it's not as well known or as understood as dyslexia but some experts believe it occurs just as often it goes by many different names some schools may refer to it as a mathematical learning disability you may hear a doctor refer to it as a Mattox disorder still yet some parents and some kids call it dyslexia math which really doesn't make sense because dyslexia and dyscalculia are two different things so stay away from that term because we don't want to confuse people they're not there's enough confusion out there already so people who have dyscalculia generally have poor number sense and they struggle with working memory now for the sake of this video I've decided to put the signs and symptoms in the description box below because I really want to jump ahead to the assimilation because I think it's such a cool tool and I know for some of you you think just going through those slots aboard so for those of you who need to see that please look down in the description box below and we're gonna jump right into the assimilation okay so here we are just to kind of let you guys know this is a website that I absolutely love it is called wwsz org so hopefully you are very interested in doing this simulation for yourself sharing it with general education teachers as well as your parents I will make sure I put a link down below so that it will take you directly to it so it's called through your child's eyes and that's because they really want you to be able to experience this as if you were a child with a learning disability now they actually have simulations for reading issues writing issues as well as attention issues math issues and organization issues now I eventually might do a video for each one of these but right now we're gonna go ahead on and focus only on the mat and we can either click on the math right here and go straight to it or we can click here on experience that and what they would want you to do is to let's click on it alright here we go it will allow you to personalize it so if you teach an elementary second-grade you can click on second-grade I think I am gonna do 6th grade okay and then it asks you what issues your child is heaven or you know what particular area so for the sake of this video we're gonna do the math issues now let me just go ahead and let you know when I click on this it's actually gonna give me a video of a child telling her story after that then it's gonna take us to the simulation now if you do not want to hear the video you can skip it but I think it's also part of the experience especially if you don't already have a particular student in mind so let's go all right so it says math issues math issues go beyond doing addition and subtraction in the classroom we'll show you how math troubles can add up for your child all right let's get started I'm Alex great and math is not easy for me when I look at a math problem all I see is confusion and it's like what are numbers a lot of times I get the signs mixed up I don't know what they're called my brain is going here to there to there to there to there and it's just so crazy that I just want to scream if my stomach starts to hurt I start to think the worst things about me it's so overwhelming and stressful that it's hard to even think and we're gonna get started it says exact change click on coins to play for goodies when you have the exact change hit by ready start all right so this is an apple seven cents I'm gonna click on five wait wait a minute ha my face okay oh oh wait a minute okay so up here so tenses is 13 cents five sentences okay so it's a quarter hold on I didn't I missed a little key thingy all right ah no okay there we go I like so 42 cents 42 cents okay so I guess we're gonna do a nickel so that's 34 plus let's see what this diamond give us ah that's too much hold on what happened okay that sees it no that's 40 so okay okay let's go I'm confused okay twenty does it oh yay that's it crazy oh okay milk is 83 cents 83 cents all right so I think I'm gonna start with this big number again which gives me 30 for the nickel then imma do the penny 63 six now I need something that says ten cents but it doesn't have ten cents so oh no do I want to try again no I know let's continue I don't want to be that what idea so my guess is that activity was pretty frustrating how children with math issues feel every time they're stuck on a math problem but there's lots of different reasons why they might get stuck one is that they might have difficulty for treating math facts so if a child doesn't remember that five times four is 20 they have to solve the problem every single time they see it and that can be frustrating another reason might be that they have difficulty remembering the steps and all the procedures they have to follow or mainly remember them but just have difficulty keeping track of where they're at and what they're doing so I add on that that the children might be feeling stressed out because they know they're not good at math where they believe they're not good at math and that stress adds to their difficulty and can make the problem-solving even harder absolutely so and our job is to find what strategies fit what child does a child need practice learning math and let's say donate and so thank you for experiencing through your child's eyes so I wasn't that really cool now if you couldn't really see my face you would have seen me like Oh what is this so it was a bit confusing and as you can see I still never got the answer to the third question so once again I encourage you to do this simulation yourself and then pass it on to your colleagues as well as your friend friends or vice versa so if you're a parent pass it on to teachers teachers if you are a teacher pass it on to your parents and if you are individual with a learning disability you don't have to take it because you experience it every day well that's it stay tuned for my next video coming up I'm not exactly sure which learning disabilities I will be talking about but I encourage you to stick with me if you guys have any questions or anything that you eventually would like for me to do a video on please get in contact with me I have an IG account and that is at the LG educator and as always you can also communicate with me down below in the comments section have a great one as you know I I am a special education teacher my goal is to share Oh into them",

        "video_title": "Covid Care: Helpful Home Breathing Practices to Increase Oxygen Saturation",
        "video_sub_title": "namaste my name is ruchi raj welcome to this special series on breathing exercises during covet times today i'm going to teach you exercises which will instantly increase your oxygen saturation so this especially for people who have got infected by the coronavirus or who are going into post covid recovery phase these exercises have been practiced by corbin patients and they have seen their oxymeter rating going up till 98 99 even 100 number one technique you would be requiring a balloon which is preferably or of a larger size you can do it without the balloon but this is going to be much more effective if you have a balloon keep your spine erect shoulders relaxed chin parallel to the ground and sit on the floor or sit on a chair or if you're in a hospital you can do it on the bed as well breathe in through the nose long and deep easy going on exhalation you blow the balloon out and then you rest for a few seconds then again you breathe in through the nose exhale blow air into the balloon let it expand then again rest then breathe in blow into the balloon and rest so three times we are going to do this that's enough you can practice this about two or three times in a day especially when your oxygen levels are dipping down this is going to instantly raise them up okay so i will show you with the balloon breathing in through the nose [Music] so so and after three times you may relax feel the state of your mind and body and open your eyes this is a super beneficial and fun exercise you can check your oxymeter and you can write down in your comments how the oxygen rating has increased just with the simple exercise second exercise would require a straw so if you have a straw you can take hold of it you will breathe in naturally long and deep rhythmically effortlessly with a smile and on exhalation you will blow air into the straw slow and deep and keep the exhalation equal to inhalation or even better longer than inhalation and make sure you exhale fully so we will do this exercise about three to five times you can also do it for about five minutes and i would recommend you can do it once or twice a day on an empty stomach as usual for all the breathing exercises you have to keep your spine wrecked ideally not take a back support when you're doing breathing exercises you can take a hip support you can sit on a floor sit on a chair and if you don't have a straw you can mimic the same breathing exercise without a straw so i will show you without the straw breathing in naturally with a smile on exhalation blow out air from your mouth it's also called pursed lipped breathing as if you're blowing into this straw so you're not whistling and you're not making sounds the more subtler you do these exercises much better and much more effective this is okay as you breathe in you feel the abdomen rising [Music] as you exhale you feel the mind relaxing [Music] [Music] and slowly you may open your eyes this activates your parasympathetic nervous system and relaxes your mind removes anxiety and stress now the third tip i would like to give you since the infection is mainly in the lower lobes of your lungs and if you keep on lying down and sitting with the back support the lungs do not get exercised right they do not get a space to expand and fully breathe in so one of the most or highly recommended exercises that the doctors all over the world are recommending is pruning pruning is basically lying down on your stomach and if your oxygen levels have dipped quite a bit low you should instantly do pruning along with the exercises i've just mentioned to you and make sure you keep a couple of pillows under your chest and a couple of pillows under your thighs and if possible the diaphragm which is just below your lungs has no pillow or restriction underneath what you can also do is keep one pillow under your head so that you're relaxing while pruning let me just show you so keep a couple of one or two pillows under your chest and keep the diaphragm free from the pillow so that it can expand fully and if you want another pillow under your chin or head that would be great and one pillow under your shin okay so we are going to lie down on the prone position you can keep your hands like this you can spread your legs and completely relax and deep breathe in this position after some time you can change the direction of your head or you can keep your chin on top of your hands proning can be avoided by people who have cardiac issues and women in pregnancy and people with any back issues and slowly after about 20 to 30 minutes maximum you can lie down on your right side or the left side and you can sit up and take care of your family members smile more be in gratitude it's all going to be okay peace and namaste",

        "video_sub_title": "how to treat an unconscious choking adulterer child if food or an object becomes stuck in the throat and blocks the flow of air the flow of oxygen is cut off to the brain and the person will eventually lose consciousness it's always helpful to be prepared to treat an unconscious person who isn't breathing with cardiopulmonary resuscitation CPR one of the most important distinctions is knowing the differences between performing CPR on an infant under the age of one a child age one to age eight or an adult treating an infant check for breathing if the choking infant younger than one year old has become unresponsive you should first assess the situation have someone call 911 other than you is around have that person call 911 taking first-aid steps for the infant note that if you're the only person around and the baby isn't breathing at all you should begin CPR before calling 911 to first ensure that the baby receives circulation and oxygen if you're the only person around but others are within earshot then proceed through the next steps while periodically yelling for help ideally someone else will be able to call 911 to the baby look for an obvious obstruction with the infant laying flat tilt the baby's head back and open his mouth if you can see the object remove it but only if the object is easily removed if the object is lodged you don't want to risk pushing it farther into the infant's throat attempt to clear the airway if the baby is conscious if the baby is unconscious or shows no signs of breathing skip to the next step this step should only be taken if the infant is conscious if the infant is unconscious begin CPR immediately if the unresponsive infant shows signs of reduced breathing then you want to attempt to clear the infant's airway try the following methods sit rest your forearm on your thigh and place the infant facedown along the length of your forearm the baby's head should be angled slightly downward as well use the heel of your hand to thump the middle of the infant's back five times with firm but not violent thumps watch to see if the object is logis roll the infant face up onto your forearm again with the head lower than the torso place two fingers along the center of the baby's breastbone and quickly compress the chest five times check the mouth again to see if the action dislodge the object repeat steps attempting to dislodge the object as long as the infant shows signs of breathing in a pulse if the object dislodges and the baby resumes breathing then call 911 fin closely until help arrives if the infant stops breathing entirely at any time in the process or becomes unconscious move to the next step perform chest compressions if the infant is unconscious then you need to begin CPR the method for giving an infant CPR is different than with a child or adult begin with chest compressions that will help maintain blood circulation to the brain to perform chest compressions on an infant place the infant on a hard flat surface a table or even the floor will suffice put two fingers on the center of the infant's chest imagine a straight line between the baby's nipples and place the fingers just below where this line would be press down with your fingers to compress the chest around 1.5 inches 3.8 centimeters the rate of the compressions should be around 100 per minute however ensure that the infant's chest rises all the way back up between compressions perform 30 compressions counting them aloud as you go check the infant's airway the compressions may have dislodged the object in the baby's throat after 30 compressions check the infant's airway again tip the baby's head back by lifting the chin while pressing down on the forehead with the other hand open the mouth to see if you can now remove the object again only if easily removable spend several seconds no more than ten feeling for breath and watching the infant's chest to see if he or she is breathing without assistance perform rescue breathing if you are trained and comfortable doing so if the unconscious infant still isn't breathing you may want to perform rescue breathing techniques however new recommendations by the American Heart Association state that if you are untrained in CPR you can just do chest compressions and do not need to perform rescue breathing cover the infant's mouth and nose with your mouth use your cheeks not your lungs to deliver a quick gentle blow of air that lasts one second provide a second breathe the same way watch the babies chest to see if it rises which will tell you if the breaths are getting around the blockage or not if air does not go in reposition the head and try one more breath if the first breath goes in give a second rescue breath and then do another set of chest compressions call 911 you want to repeat the cycle of CPR 30 chest compressions followed by 2 rescue breaths the seconds can be precious continue giving the baby assistance as the phone rings etc follow the 911 operators instructions once the call is answered repeat CPR cycles continue performing CPR cycles between chest compressions and rescue breathing continue taking a few seconds to see if the blockage has been dislodged and if the baby has resumed breathing perform another cycle each time the baby shows no signs of life repeat until emergency responders arrive if necessary if you are getting tired see if there is another person trained in CPR to take over for you or help with two-person CPR",

        "video_sub_title": ">> This episode of the Modern Rogue, brought to you by Bombfell. >> Go to bombfell.com/rogue and get $25 off your first purchase. >> Yeah. Wait, why are we, why are we, we're teaching, this is-- >> This is horrible. >> No, this is awful. We're testing the efficacy of this confiscated weapon. >> JASON: This is extraordinarily dangerous, reckless, stupid, and requires no skill [sighs], so it's perfect for us. [relaxing music] >> Narrator: Testing the efficacy of the razor blade flail. >> I don't even know what it is. But I'm looking at a ruler, well, we got some hex nuts, we got shoelaces, and razor blades. >> Yeah, this is a bladed flail that was confiscated from a prisoner in Hamburg, Germany in 1996. >> Holy crap. >> It's very simple, it's very basic. But it's just so evil, that I wanted to do it and test it. >> Okay, so a flail, normally you got a whole bunch of things with barbs and stuff on it. In this case, I can see the ruler already, even they conveniently made a hole. >> That's what they're for, yeah. >> [laughs] Step one, tie it off. >> JASON: Yes. I'm going to have two. >> BRIAN: Oh, wait. Oh, you didn't tell me you could have two. >> You can't have two, I'm having two. You just do one. >> Well, I don't want it to be this long. I'm going to [mumbles], like look at that. [laughs] Oh, damn it, stop [laughs]. Now I've got two [laughs]. >> JASON: Ow, ow, ow. [laughs] [clicking] >> Ow, you son of [beep]. >> [laughs] I could tell that stung, I'm sorry. >> JASON: Oh, it did, it did. [laughs] >> Ah, ow, wow, okay. >> Yeah, I'm going to do the two thing, that seemed much more effective. >> Ooh, yes. >> Okay, so you thread it through. >> JASON: Now, we only have two hex nuts. The hex nuts are really just to weight these. >> BRIAN: Yeah. >> The real damage is when you get the razor blades on there. >> So how do you, what do you do with the razor blades? >> JASON: Okay, well. >> BRIAN: There we go. >> JASON: Wait, wait, wait. [laughs] Put those on. >> BRIAN: All right, all right, all right, all right. >> JASON: These are anti-cut gloves, sent to us by one of The Modern Rogue community. You know what? >> Wait, what are you doing? >> I can't, I need the dexterity. [laughs] >> I guess you tie a double knot where you want it to be, and then you tie another one above it. That's what I'm going to guess. You're right, I need the dexterity too [laughs]. I'll be real careful. So I tied off one knot, but put this very delicately. And then I'll tie it off above it with another double knot. You know what I just realized? The problem with doubling it up like this, is that it's going to be considerably shorter with all the knots that we're doing. That already looks scary. >> Yeah, that's no good. [hammering] It's like I'm almost, there we go. That's good. >> Oh, oh, the razor blade cut the shoelace. >> Oh, wow. >> Look, and it's about to cut on this one too. It's already, look at it, it's barely holding on by a hair. Yeah, we didn't think that part through. >> JASON: Nope [laughs]. >> BRIAN: Same thing over here. Wow. What are you doing?! That's blood. >> Does that count? >> You counted it when it was me. Oh, I need the dexterity. >> I need-- >> I can't use the [mumbles]. >> It's a tiny, tiny little poke. >> You think that if you don't wash it off, it's not an injury [laughs]. [clicking] [laughs] okay, so I got to start all over again. >> JASON: Here, do you want some of these X-ACTO blades? >> BRIAN: No, no, no, no, I'm scared of those. I think those are legit horrifying. >> JASON: Okay. >> See how I've got this big, fat knot there? >> JASON: Mm-hmm. >> Now, the problem before was I was wrapping it around, so the blade was rubbing on it. >> JASON: Yeah. >> BRIAN: Instead, this will go straight down the middle and stop there. I got a knot on each side of this, and I double knotted that first one. I don't think you even need to double knot. I think you could just put one on each side, so there you go. So there, another knot. Oh yeah, this is the way to go. You do a knot, you slide on the blade, you do a knot over the knot. And then you get, I think three's all you're really going to be able to get. [sigh] Look at that. >> That's wicked. >> That's horrifying, is what it is. >> That is truly wicked. >> BRIAN: So I've got a triple knot on here, double knots on each side, and a triple knot on the end. I think this guy is finished. >> Let's just use that one. >> Okay. >> BRIAN: All right, so the changeling has now morphed into a zombie. Which means we have to make flesh-like bits to him, because this is fiberglass. >> JASON: Just want to wedge it into this? >> Yeah, here you go, have him pinch that. >> Okay. >> There you go. [laughs] This is how it goes when you're attacked in prison, is they hold a target, and they say, \"Roar, I don't like you very much.\" Let's cover him with expired meat. >> This might be a new low for us. >> No, a new high [laughs]. >> Do your kids ever ask you what you do with your Saturdays? >> You hold him, and I'm going to pin the meat on [laughs]. This is a beautiful meat shield [laughs]. >> My father was a meat pinner, my grandfather was a meat pinner before him. [laughs] >> I come from a long family of meat pinners. >> My hands are all slippery now. >> [laughs] Here, I'll be, I'm the meat pinner. >> JASON: I'm going to pin this one. I want to do one. [laughs] It's terrible. >> See, this is why you leave the meat pinning to me. Get a meat, come on. Damn it, no! God dammit [growls]! [sigh] Prisoner XK99. >> It's like we're in an intergalactic prison, right? >> Yeah. >> And we have found-- >> And the changeling showed up, morphed into a zombie, angry, going to attack us. And we have to defend ourselves with a flail, which means we need safety gear. Safety gear. >> Yes. >> I think the way you normally use a flail, would be like overhand and left and right, and swing it around and all that stuff. >> Yeah, you're probably going to-- >> We don't want to do that. >> No, we do not. >> So I'm going to do this, and then you hide. Ready? Hey man, this is an intergalactic prison riot. Get out of here changeling. [whack] That didn't. [whack] Bro, I chopped his head off. [slow motion whack] Oh my god. Holy cow, are you. [whack] Okay. [slow motion whack] >> JASON: Is it more the hex nut that's doing the damage? >> BRIAN: Yeah, well it's definitely whacking with the hex nut. But you can tell that everything else is chopping at it at the same time. Here, you give it a try, I said terrifiedly. All right, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. >> JASON: I'm going to do a thing. >> BRIAN: No, no, no, no. >> JASON: Okay, I'm going to go hard. >> BRIAN: No, no. >> [laughs] I'm just kidding. >> BRIAN: I swear to god. [whacking] Oh, that's what it is. The cutting action seems to come when you go out and then you yank it back. >> JASON: Yeah. >> BRIAN: Now I don't want to whip it back in our faces, but like a slow motion version would be. [whack] You kind of drag it across. Like you go [mumbles]. [whacking] The dragging motion, oh my god. Yeah, you can see pieces of it being sliced off. That's what it is. Is it goes in, and you drag it back. Whoa! Look at all these. >> JASON: That's what I was trying to get. >> BRIAN: It's going chew, chew, chew. >> JASON: Yeah, I was trying to get when I was going a little bit down, so it would cut across like that. And we've got some actual legit slices. >> BRIAN: This is the slice. Here, I want you to go in and pull back. >> JASON: Okay. >> BRIAN: Not towards yourself. Don't let it hit you. [whack] Okay see, that's the problem, you're pulling it toward yourself too hard. [whacking] I actually think it would word better, if it was slightly shorter. [whack] [laughs] Here, I'm going to try, if we shorten this just a bit. >> Okay. >> I need the dexterity. [laughs] >> This is probably not the smartest prison weapon. >> No, it's really not. >> I don't recommend it. >> Here. >> You want to do it, and I'll get over here? >> Yeah, I guess, okay. So somebody's coming up, slice you. [whack] [slow motion whack] So you see the impact there, and there's definitely a slice across the chest. [whacking] Look at that. So obviously, this is not super strong, so you can just cut it right off. But you can see the points where it's slicing into the flesh on there as well. >> JASON: Take it and try to rake it down the front. [whack] >> BRIAN: Like that? >> JASON: Yeah. >> BRIAN: When I felt that, I felt the hooks just stick right into it that time. [slow motion whack] Oh, dude, it definitely jabbed right into the chest. [laughs] >> JASON: Make sure you get back, okay. [whack] [laughs] >> BRIAN: That would definitely slice up the face, for sure. >> JASON: Yeah. [whacking] >> BRIAN: God, yeah. >> JASON: Yeah. >> BRIAN: When that thing hits, it's just taking giant bites out of it, wow. [slow motion whack] Uh yeah, I'm going to call it. >> JASON: So effective, but maybe not the most efficient. There are probably a lot of other prison weapons that you could craft, even using this stuff, that works way better than this. But, this is super evil. >> Super evil. Look at all these individual scars, where you can see the blade just pierced, pierced, pierced, pierced, pierced, pierced. I'm going to say fearsome, but dumb and cumbersome. >> Yeah, and it also-- >> Unwieldy. >> You run the risk of this popping back and hurting you, just as much as you do hurting someone else with it. >> Which, if you're in the middle of an intergalactic prison riot, you probably don't have a lot to lose. >> Yeah. >> Because you're a gambler on the run. >> You're going to want to go for something, maybe kyber crystal powered or something like that. >> [laughs] Yeah. Okay, we're going to say dumb, but scary. >> Yeah, I think that's fair. >> Bad weapon. >> All right, people keep making fun of my pants. >> They are not making fun of your pants, they love your pants. They love that you be your wacky, wild, self expressive self. You do wear some wild pants though. >> Man, maybe this is the way to meliorate my shame. >> Well don't steer into it, that's the thing about Bombfell. You get an actual stylist, who listens to what you like. You look at them, and you say, \"I'm Jason Murphy, and I wear wacky pants.\" And then they're going to start sending you wackier pants. >> They're going to send me wacky pants? >> Keep sending you pictures of pants, and you're like, \"Wackier!\" >> \"Wackier!\" You can preview everything they're going to send you and say, \"No, no, yes, more.\" >> Of course, free shipping, you're able to do returns. You're not obligated to keep anything you want. But the more stuff that you do keep, the bigger the discount that you get. >> Oh, that looks nice. >> Yes! >> JASON: You got pants? >> I got pants! >> JASON: Are they wacky? >> I'm going to, I'll be right back. >> Are you going to put the shorts over the pants? >> No, I'm going to [mumbles]. Try it, maybe that's what they intended. That's a nice fit. >> Holy cow dude, classy AF.

        "video_title": "DEMO: MAC Pro Longwear Foundation on Oily Skin - maricarljanah",
        "video_sub_title": "hey guys I'm back with a new video today I will be doing a demo video of the Mac Pro Longwear foundation it retails for 31 dollars and it comes in this 230 fluid No 1 fluid ounce bottle so that's 30ml just the standard amount of foundation and since it does retail for 31 dollars which isn't cheap let's test how it works on oily skin and how it lasts throughout the day I have used this for about 2 weeks and I have my thoughts about it but let's talk about that at the end of the video will not be priming my face I will not be setting it and I will not be saying with a setting spray so let's go ahead and do this so for this foundation it comes into some kind of automatic lock cover pump think I don't know how to call it but it's really great because it controls the amount of product that you get and you can just lock it so it doesn't spill so I usually just use one pump because I don't want heavy coverage especially during the summer the summer so just about that amount and it's quite liquidy umm it's like a liquid creamy consistency but it's not too heavy and I'm just going to use my expert face brush by Real Techniques and dab that in there I just start with my chin and then work my way up I usually focus the coverage on the center of my face because I do have a lot of redness there and my dark circles as well it's just a really great way to even out my skin tone so on normal days I just use that amount of foundation because I go over it with my pro longwear concealer which all have a different demo on and then my under-eye concealer because I don't want too much layer on my face but for demonstration purposes I'm going to do my entire face using this foundation so I'm just going to get another pump of the product and apply it on the outsides of my face so just a tip during summer it's really better to just keep the face product at a minimum only cover the areas that need to be covered and if you do have certain blemishes on specific areas of your face just go over it with a concealer that would last like the pro longwear concealer or the elf HD no not HD but like the coverall concealer I think it's called because those are the two concealers I've been using lately and they work really well from this video you can tell that it has a natural coverage and then you can build it up to medium and then you can build it up even more to a full coverage and what I like about this foundation is it doesn't have a smell to it and then it sinks really fast onto your skin and it dries quick but not too quick that you won't be able to blend it any more and um I really really like that and it just kind of it settles on the skin and makes it feel like your own skin it doesn't feel heavy at all I heard that this formula is waterproof I'm not too sure about about that so I don't even know how to test if it's waterproof um should I cry or something I don't know I think that's enough product I'm not going to build it up too much I do have certain areas of my face that I still need to cover but I will be back I'll just finish this whole look and then we'll see how it lasts on the face I did promise that I would be back right after I did my makeup but something came up and I am back now it has been I think three four hours let me just show you the time I know for a fact that I finished my entire makeup around 1:00 um so I applied the foundation around 12:00 to 1:00 and now it is 4:42 in the afternoon so that's approximately three to four hours and this is how my face looks like J you can tell that I have a lot of shiny spots I'm not solely on the sides of my face but this one's just the main character here and yeah that's kind of a bugger because that's more than half of my face you know and it's the right smack in the middle and um it's been about 3-4 hours and this is how it looks like but if I were outside this would have probably happened in just after like two hours or so we will check I will check back in a few hours so you can see how it looks like in about six eight more hours and then I will talk to you about what I think about the foundation but I'm pretty sure you can tell by now you have an idea of how it is I'm back and it had been about four five like six hours in total I believe because it's some 641 right now that's a message um is 641 right now and it's been two hours since but my last clip and this is how I look like definitely the makeup on my nose since it wasn't set it so on it's like you could tell like hello if my eyes are a little bit more smudgy that's because I cried I was like watching this really emotional TV TV so you know not TV series but movie on Netflix and I cry so guess what I was able to test if it's waterproof and it's pretty much water fruit because I still have my foundation on so good job um what kind of liquid liner is waterproof like what brand can you recommend like on the comments below alright so I think that'll be it for my sort of how long last on my face that's another text message um anyway I'll get back to you I can't think um yes for my general overview of this foundation I'm actually a little bit disappointed at how it performed on me just because I had high expectations it's pro longwear it's um from MEC it's 31 dollars I would assume that it would stay put almost a lot better than it did and you can see how it performed on my face because I can't really say that it's because I didn't wear primer and setting spray and all that stuff because even if I do wear primer it still gets really oily and around two or three hours if I'm outside and I've been trying to figure out what to do to kind of control that I'm trying to check if it's my skincare if it's just the whether it's my primer or if it's just this foundation because when I use my covergirl three-in-one foundation I don't really get as oily so yeah that's one of the main things I really wanted to mention about this foundation I don't regret buying it I really don't but I don't think it performed as well as I it would I don't forget to check out my previous videos I will leave it in the description back description facts description involved and yeah I hope you enjoyed this video thumbs up if you liked it and don't hesitate to share it to everyone if you think they would be interested in it and yeah",

        "video_sub_title": "hello, my name is Dr. Siddharth Vashishtha and I am an ENT surgeon at Pristyn Care, Gurgaon In this video, we'll discuss tonsils. so, what are tonsils? tonsils is a lymphoid tissue that is present behind our tongue on both the sides of our throat tonsils dissolve all the bacterias, viruses, food particles Whatever can get stuck in your throat and do not let the infection spread in the bottom region. we do not  have just one lymphoid tissue rather we have several numbers of lymphoid tissues all these lymphoid tissues prevent infection and it is natural tissue. some people ask that are the tonsils and adenoids are the same? no, tonsils and adenoids are quite similar but they both have differences. tonsils are present in the throat  and tonsils are encapsulated whereas adenoids are not capsulated and are fully diffused. adenoids are present just behind the nose region when you are younger your immune system is being developed, during this tonsils and adenoids performs their function and dissolves all the bacterias  and protect us but some people ask why we should get them removed? tonsils are present in every human being but we don't need to get them removed  it can be cured by normal treatment and medicines. there are some special indications and in such cases, we need to remove the tonsils. how we get an infection in the tonsils? one is acute tonsillitis, like  just a few days before  if you feel any pain and the tonsils get infected   the other is chronic tonsillitis which means tonsils which is present for a long duration of time almost, 2 months, 3 months, one year, or 3 years or more symptoms of acute tonsillitis are sore throat, difficulty in swallowing food, fever, stiff neck, white patches on tonsils whereas chronic tonsils are mainly found in adults. its symptoms are bad breath, stone formation, white spots. the symptoms of acute and chronic tonsillitis are similar in both young and adults what is the treatment of acute tonsillitis? you can simply take warm water and add some as,t to it and then do gargles  or avoid spicy and oily food you can have tea,  green tea with adding some amount of honey to it or any other normal home remedy if the problem gets severe then you can consult a doctor. you can have an appointment with an ENT doctor he'll provide you with a course which can help you treat the problem if you get frequent infections in your tonsils let us say 4-5 times in 2 years or 7 episodes in a year in this case, we can say that yes the problem is getting worse and you have to get it removed as I already told in my previous video the lymphoid is not the only tissue, as you get older your body is able to fight such infections itself if they cause a lot of problems or in the case of children if they face obstructive symptoms because of which they snore or breath while mouth opened can cause a change in facial expressions such as teeth comes out, the habit of breathing while mouth opened because they breathe for a long time with the mouth opened. we are naturally nose breathers. it' treatment is very simple. it's a very simple surgery which is called as tonsillectomy. which used to be a painful surgery earlier. but nowadays, due to advancements in technology, they are painless. you just have to be in hospital only for 24 hours after that, you have to follow some diet restrictions too because after any surgery related to your throat you are prescribed not to eat some of the foods for 3-4 days and then you can go back to your normal diet, and follow some precautions and also you will be given some antibiotics  this is a very safe and simple surgery, some people say that there is a change in the voice of the person who goes through the surgery  which is absolutely wrong. there is nothing related which relates to change in voice and the surgery  voice is produced through your voice box which is present below the throat and tonsils are presented here  so there is no correlation between them. The next question is that is there any cut that is made while doing the surgery? so, the whole surgery is done inside the patient's mouth and there is no external cuts and scarring takes place The next question is what is the minimum age for getting a tonsillectomy done? tonsillectomy can even be done in children with the age of  3-4 years but its indications are different as I told you earlier that children breathe with an opened mouth which is causing infections in the tonsils and they are not able to lead their normal life. indications in adults and children are similar but the children go a little towards obstructive ones next question, can tonsils occur again after the tonsillectomy? no, as I told you earlier that tonsils are encapsulated but adenoids are not encapsulated  so, tonsils cannot occur again if you get the tonsils removed once. nowadays, the most advanced technology used in tonsillectomy at Pristyn care is coblation technology it does not cause scars and pain and you can leave the hospital the next day  if you have any queries and fear that these problems or infections take place frequently  in you then you should consult an ENT doctor near you because for such a simple procedure if we consume antibiotics again and again our body slowly develops an antibiotic resistance  so, it is better to consult a specialist rather than following your own medications and if needed then it's just a simple surgery  if you want to ask anything related to advanced technology then you can call on the no. given below If you loved the video please subscribe to our youtube channel and like our videos.",

        "video_sub_title": "we're going to have a look at how infectious diseases are transmitted and a few different ways to control their spread first let's have a look at how people can get infected with these diseases in general there are three main components that need to interact with each other for an infectious disease to occur this model of infectious disease is causation is called an epidemiological triad the first component is the agent this is the organism that causes the disease it can be bacteria viruses parasites or fungi second is the host who is the target of the disease the third component is the environment this refers to the surroundings and conditions that are external to the host that allows the disease to be transmitted in addition to these three components transmission pathways between each of these allow the spread of infection these transmission pathways can be direct or indirect in direct transmission the organism is transmitted directly to the person this could be through touching sexual intercourse coughing or sneezing on the other hand in indirect transmission the organism is transmitted via an intermediate there are several ways that this can occur it can be through contaminated objects such as toys soiled clothes or even through food or water it can also be through an intermediate vectors such as a mosquito or a tick now that we know how infectious diseases are transmitted let's have a look at how to control them changing behavior can reduce or eliminate the risk of exposure to an infectious agent and prevent their spread there are many different and sometimes simple health behaviors that can be adopted including using condoms to eliminate or reduce the risk of sexually transmitted disease regular hand-washing having a healthy diet or using insect repellents behavior change is an important target of Health Promotion programs vaccines are one of the biggest successes of Public Health and have led to reductions and in some instances eradication of infectious diseases routine immunization of children has led to a dramatic decline in diseases like measles diphtheria and pertussis saving countless lives vaccines not only protect the individuals but by increasing the level of immunity in the community also protect others this is called herd immunity medication has been one of the mainstays of managing infectious diseases antimicrobial medication worked by either killing the microorganisms or inhibiting the replication they're not only used in treating diseases but in some situations can also be used to prevent infections before or after being exposed to a disease pre and post exposure prophylaxis a significant issue in the fight against microorganisms is antimicrobial resistance this can happen when microorganisms develop resistance to drugs that were once effective against them antimicrobial resistance has been accelerated by the inappropriate or excessive use of antimicrobial drugs and has become a significant issue in the fight against microbes surveillance is a tool that is used to control infectious diseases it is used to monitor diseases and their trends characterize patterns of disease and detect outbreaks surveillance can also guide the prioritization development and evaluation of disease control programs in most countries there are a number of diseases or conditions that are required to be notified by law these are called notifiable diseases laboratories and doctors routinely send information to health departments who monitor them and act accordingly modifying the environment is another way to control infectious diseases this includes activities like vector control which is the eradication or control of vectors that can transmit diseases like malaria and dengue ensuring that there is safe water supply which leads to a reduction in waterborne diseases like cholera Christo's / idiom and hepatitis E and improving sanitation facilities in hygiene which can reduce the spread of diseases like Shigella hepatitis A and salmonella other environmental measures include improving housing and working conditions ensuring food safety and enhancing air quality infection control and health care facilities is important because infections can spread quite rapidly in these facilities if proper precautions are not taken ways to prevent the spread of infection include proper sterilization of equipment wearing appropriate personal protective equipment isolating infectious patients strict hand-washing practices regular cleaning and having a good hospital surveillance system so that these infections are recognized and managed early there are various other factors that contribute to the control of infectious diseases these include broader measures like improving the social determinants of health such as education and employment having strong healthcare systems and having an effective health workforce finally the one health concept recognizes that human health is closely connected to the health of animals and the environment therefore successful control of infectious diseases requires the cooperation and collaboration of many specialties including veterinary and environmental sciences so that's a quick overview of controlling infectious diseases we've taken a quick look at how infectious diseases are transmitted and a number of ways to control their spread [Music]",

        "video_sub_title": "hey guys welcome back to the chi channel I'm peatling off at chili head and this is review 14 this source is going to be the first in a double bill of mustard based sources I thought I'd go for a little theme just for once and just do a little run of shows about certain kind of sources and this one that i'm doing today was very generously donated to me by the lovely people at hopheads calm so Stuart and all the team there thank you very much guys you rock my world go and check out their site hotheads calm it's awesome they've got loads of sources loads of chili products they're all great in the delivery super fast as well so what more could you want right this one today is one that I've tried another one in this very range it wasn't too impressed with it but you know I've heard good things about the rest of the range so I'm really wanting to give this one a go this is pain is good batch 164 honey kyon hot mustard sauce bit of a mouthful so it's pain is good batch 164 her knee kyon hot pepper sauce I've had the garlic style panies good source and like I said I wasn't that impressed with it a bit too vinegary for me and for my personal taste not enough garlic I know most of you out there will probably disagree with me on that one but you know if I biota garlic sauce I want it to be really really strong and because I love my guy but for me was just slightly laughing to be honest I had a good burn it wasn't unpleasant at all but I have been expecting better I have seen a lot of reviews at the rest of this of the pain is good range and everyone that tries the rest of them says that they are pretty damn good so I'm expecting nice things from this and it does sound gorgeous penny cayenne mustard I mean how cool is that so this is one of these full of the diva kind of range i'm not sure why but it does say milder at the top and the peppers in here of course our clients i'm not expecting it to be ridiculously hot but of course it is a pain is good sauce so what we know I'm sure it's not going to be a complete walk in the park so ingredients we have honey mustard hot sauce olive oil cider vinegar orange juice corn syrup garlic xanthan gum which is a thickener and spices and it also says on this on the side here the mustard seed has meant many things to time the humble state has been presented as a lover's gift and found its way to the healing arts so rich and full is its history a three thousand year history is yours with the coming together of spice and sweet and heat spicy mustard seed a touch of honey and a fire of cayenne with batch 164 this is made in the USA distributed by one specialty foods zinc and you can find them at original Hwang com that's Ju am but of course as I said you can also get us from Hot Heads and all the rest of the pages good range too so yeah I mean the ingredients sound fantastic it's odd to see hot sauce in the middle of this because you know hot sauce is what this is I'm surprised that that's an ingredient on its own but i'm presuming that the the Cayenne is within that hot sauce it does say that there's a pepper match with in there doesn't say cayenne but I'm guessing that that's what it is um as we can see looks like it flows pretty well and we can see it's got that kind of off yellow kind of mustardy tinge to it lots of seeds and the flats of things floating around in there and I'm just going to use my scissors for this one because it does look like it's going to be hard to open normally I don't like to use is as I prefer to use my hands but this time for the sake of speed i'm just going to use my scissors so let's see you can see that it is flowing nicely there hopefully and you can see lots of lots of flex of things going on i'm sorry that the lighting doesn't appear to be too good today I've got the light coming in from the side here and it's walk over here so sorry the Lighting's not so good but hey we'll make do well we right so let's open this up and see what we have got okay 12 lovely i think i can get a bit of the orange coming through actually he certainly get mustard but it's not overpowering I mean for instance of one of the sources that I've had in the past was the crazy Jerry's mustard gas that was pure vinegar and extract and images watery there is nothing else going on in there and all you got was the extract and the mustard but this is more complex there's certainly lots of herbs and spices going on in there yeah probably some garlic as well but generally just if I mean it just feels like a felling mild but spicy sort of mixture of spices really and of course the mustard there is a sweetness there as well and you know now I think about it I are getting the honey mmm yum yum yum let's go without further ado nothing's going to give it one more shake just quickly just to make sure it hasn't settled too much okay mmm I think I'm going to like this so it's quite it's runny but it's got thickness to it there's stuff going on in there and touch that okay here we go pain is good hmm Wow I was not expecting that that flavor it's awesome mmm straight back for some more straight back for some more so much better than the peg is good guy you're so much better if miles apart this is really much more balanced and bit more complex you get bags of mustard but it's not unpleasant mustard you know how much you can go right up your nose and mingo you know like that doesn't do that it's purely in the mouth it doesn't go up your sinuses at all and mm just coat the mouth in mustard goodness there's honey in there as well definitely brings a lovely sweetness to it and then you've got this lovely spice mix and lots of herbs and spices just bring your nice little warmth to the mouth it's not hot at all it is mild like it says on the bottle but the flavors gorgeous it's very very nice and I think I can detect the orange juice as well just in the background just adding a slight fruitiness and a slight hint of sweetness you know adding to the honey mm-hmm let me just have a quick look it's not particularly vinegary there is distilled vinegar in there and cider vinegar but it's not strong at all it's not one of those sources where the vinegar overrides everything what else have we got olive oil I can't really pick up the olive oil maybe slightly in the aftertaste but not much it's more hidden really certainly the mustard and the honey really come through or and that's a very very nice sauce flavor-wise 8.5 9 out of 10 probably nine out of ten to be honest it's very well nicely balanced heat wise very low probably don't know two or three out them I'm having a lot of these sources at the moment which seemed to be quite lower down the heat scale but believe me I do have some super cops coming up so keep you know keep watching stay tuned for those but this one in terms of flavor fantastic i have to go visit for a second boot straight away i can't recommend that enough really really like it that's fantastic go and check this out pain is good match 164 hot mustard honey cayenne sauce yum yum yum I think I might have to get me some more of these famous good sauces they're really good like I said not so keen on their garlic one but this one is much much better awesome stuff okay station guys I have more reviews coming up very very soon look forward to seeing you all then bye bye",

        "video_sub_title": "hi everyone welcome back to my channel I wanted to make this video dedicated to something that I had been struggling with for the past five months for the past five months I had been struggling with ITP and for those of you that don't know what ITP is it is the short version for thrombocytopenia I think that's how you say it and I just gotta say I am NOT a specialist in this or any of that I am just speaking from my experience and from what I know what the doctors told me what I researched the ITP is when your blood platelet counts are really low her blood platelets are what is in your blood that helps your blood to clot with so basically in my blood there was a dangerously low amount of platelets a normal platelet count ranges anywhere from 150,000 to 450,000 I'm looking at this paper because it's my lab result all of my blood platelet work my little platelets started back in September of 2018 I had 28,000 platelets in my blood which is dangerously low I had gone to the doctor in September and they were doing blood work it came back that my blood platelets were very very low if I were to start bleeding him internally there would be no way for my blood to clot because I didn't have enough platelets in my body in September they told me my blood platelets were at 28,000 and I went to go see a blood specialist at that point because I was just seeing my general doctor and he suggested that I go to see a blood specialist when my blood platelets were really low that was the fifth of September I'm 2018 and my blood platelets were at 96 thousand so they had gone up a little bit but still you know it's still under 100 thousand which can still be dangerous if they keep dropping they put me on steroids and I got on the steroids they told me that the steroids way to make me hungry and that they would possibly make me gain weight and make me have more energy so I wouldn't really sleep a lot so while I was on my medication I felt fine and you know I kept taking them it was a very strong dose of steroids says over a course of four days ten pills a day which is crazy strong steroids are super terrible for your body they're not they don't do anything good for your body in the long runs and after those four days I went to go see the doctor and after I got when I got off of the steroids that's when I got really really sick because the steroids just caused a very negative effect on my body I gained so much weight from the steroids I I did have a really really strong appetite so that's probably why I gained so much weight is because the steroids wouldn't make me so hungry also the steroids caused me to have a lot of acne and I had never really struggled with acne like severe acne until I started taking the steroids and once I got off of them it was so hard for me to get my skin back under control so I got off the steroids I couldn't get back to my normal sleeping schedule for a while and that sucked so much once I got off of the steroids September 10th 2018 my blood platelet count was at 247 thousand which is where I should be so that was good I was happy about that um but again I was feeling very crappy I wasn't feeling like myself after I took the steroids I just felt awful I actually ended up in the hospital after that I got very and I went to the hospital because my blusher had dropped very very low and the doctors couldn't get it back up I was feeling super dizzy and nauseous all the time when I first went into my general doctor I had noticed a lot of bruising on my body which is why they did all of the blood work on me is because I had noticed a lot of bruising and there was these little red dots on my neck is that I had never seen before so that started to really worry me and I so I went to my general doctor and they suggested that we do blood work on me to see what was going on internally in my body after I was on the steroids and they saw that my blood platelets were back to normal and I got out of the hospital and everything I remember it was around December and I started noticing the red dots again all on my neck hose no bruising this time but I did notice that there was the red dots again and I was starting to get really worried again for myself so I went to go see the blood specialist again in December December 7 2018 did blood work and my blood platelets had dropped again to 21,000 so at this point I saw a different blood specialist that day and he said that we needed to get on the steroid again and I asked for different options because I didn't like the steroids at all and I told them that that the steroids didn't make me feel like myself and my body just took a toll after I did all of that so he said that he option would be to cut the dose in half that he gave me last time so I was like okay let's just do it this time it was five pills a day for four days again but the side effects were still there I got even more acne after that and I started gaining a lot a lot of weight after I think my second dose of steroids I was probably at my heaviest that I had ever been after the steroids I felt drained like I didn't want to do anything I just wanted to lay in bed my energy was very low didn't have motivation to do anything and that is not like me and the second time I was on the steroid did bump it up again to 238,000 and platelets and that was on the 13th of December 2018 the doctor said I want to see you in a week again just to make sure that your blood platelets are not dropping even more because it could get very dangerous if they are dropping really low really fast I went back the 26th of December 2018 and my blood platelets were at 151,000 so they were dropping once again 151,000 is not dangerously low yet so they were like okay we're just gonna keep an eye on it hopefully they don't drop any more at this point I was like doing everything I could all over the home remedy is that you find on the internet for ITP I was doing them I was doing smoothies I was changing I changed my whole diet just to to ensure that my blood platelets would not drop again I did not want them to drop again I did not want to take the steroids or anything like that went back January 21st 2019 and I had been doing all of these movies and changing my diet and all of that and I was like okay they could not have dropped any more they've gotta be you know at a healthy rate so they tested my blood and it came back about my blood platelets we're at 103 thousands they were dropping still and I was so sad at this point I I didn't know what to do I lost hope for anything and for everything it was like my blood platelets are never gonna be healthy and they're just always gonna be low and like I'm always gonna feel crappy and I'm always going to be feeling like this and I just lost all hope I remember after my appointment I went home and cried so much 103,000 wasn't at the range where they had to put me on steroids if I didn't like want to so I told them I didn't want the steroids that I would just be back and see what my blood platelets were at again about nine days later I went back to the doctor and my blood platelets were at eighty one thousand and yes they kept dropping at this point the doctor was talking to me about possibly getting my spleen removed and getting surgery when I was at eighty one thousand on the 30th of January 2019 the doctor said okay you need to go home have a conversation with your parents let them know that I need your spleen removed that's the best option I have for you because your blood platelets are just always gonna keep dropping and that's that's the solution at this point they told me that what had caused my platelets to go down was an auto immune thing my immune system was trying to fight off different infections and it was fighting off my platelets my immune system was working my platelets as defective and it was kind of cleaning them out of my body that is what they thought was causing my low platelet deficiency so once I got home I um you know was very sad and everything I looked online and I was like there's got to be some natural remedy out there for people with low platelets so I did so much research while I was doing all of my research I came across an article that said that papaya leaf extract was actually really great natural remedy for low platelets and I thought where the heck am I going to get a PI leaf extract like how am I going to get that into my body I started a lot of research into leaf extract I came across a website called herbal papaya calm came across these little guys and this is papaya leaf extract and they are capsules it's about $60 per bottle you get one month's worth in here this is what they look like so they are pretty big easy basically take them one at night and one in the morning they had such amazing reviews for from people who had a little plateless that were taking these and they were talking about how they were so grateful for this product because their blood platelets had gone up significantly since taking these capsules when I saw this I was like you know what do I got to lose I've tried everything so I'm just gonna do it you know I bought a bottle it did take a while for the bottle to get to my house I think it took about two weeks and a half so when he's arrived to my house I'm super excited for them mainly because of the reviews that it had so I started taking them for about two weeks I went back to the blood specialist February 25th 2019 and my blood platelets went up to 116 thousand which was super awesome I remember I went into the doctor's thinking I was just going to get out of there with super bad news and they were gonna tell me that my blood platelets were again not like 21,000 or whatever after like all of my struggle and everything going in there and hearing now my blood platelets were going up was like one of the best things that could have ever happened to me it was all thanks to these guys because I was just taking these and they really did help and it wasn't a matter of two weeks so of course I kept taking them doctor was even surprised after looking at my history of low platelets and this is actually my third bottle now I'll probably always take these because I don't have any side-effects with them which is great that's the best part when I went in to see him I was about halfway through one bottle which was which I was at one hundred and sixteen thousand platelets and he said I want to see you again once you finish one bottle just to make sure that your blood platelets are healthy and that are not causing any damage to any other parts of your body so I went back April 4th 2019 and my blood platelets were at a hundred and sixty-four thousand which was incredible because they had gone to what they needed to be and as little as a month in some days so I was super happy I really got to think it all through this product it saved me from getting surgery that saved me from having to take those awful steroids again so this product is so so great I would HIGHLY highly recommend it to anybody definitely check them out share this video with your friends family you never know what somebody could be struggling with and we can help each other out so that is it for this video I hope you guys enjoyed if you are new to my channel I would hope that you

        "video_sub_title": "hi you guys thank you for joining me today this is doctor to hear from family pediatrics in Kenosha Wisconsin and I have been seeing tons and tons of kids coming in with flu today and also past couple days and they're getting very high fevers sometimes up to 103 degrees so today I thought it would be a perfect time to talk to you guys about using tylenol and motrin and how to use them appropriately so I'll talk to you about that okay well first of all the couple names you'll need to know the first name you'll need to know is called a cinnamon fm long name acetaminophen we know this as Tylenol so whenever you see tell now that's what that medicine is in there acetaminophen tylenol we use pretty commonly if a child is under three month old zero to three month old make sure you ask your doctor before you use Tylenol or any medication over three month old we can use Tylenol every four hours so remember Tylenol every four hours all right ibuprofen is also a common medication that's the second most or one of the most common medications and that we all know as motrin and also as Advil so when you see motrin or Advil at the store it contains ibuprofen okay 4:02 six month old don't use it because the kids just aren't ready for it seven month and older you can use it every six hours remember motrin every six hours okay Tylenol every four hours motrin every six hours now we use tylenol and motrin to control fever and also for pain such as headaches for example the port they both work really well motrin though is in a way a little bit stronger so if a fever is really high or there's lots of pain I recommend trying out motrin first motrin also lasts longer and also helps if there's injury and swelling involved so Tylenol helps with pain of the injury but motrin helps with a swelling part too so motrin is better for injury and swelling type things now it looks like motrin has a lot of advantages but it really doesn't because it has a big disadvantage motrin causes stomach upset so even though it works better it works longer I often tell parents to try Tylenol first because motrin can cause stomach upset if it's used too much okay so be careful of that now towel dollars every four hours motions every six hours but if your child has a temperature that doesn't go down or they're still uncomfortable you can actually alternate those medications so you can alternate Tylenol and motrin every three hours all right Tylenol wait three hours and give motrin wait three hours and give Tylenol wait three hours give motrin and so on so this is every three hours you're alternating this way all the medication is spaced out just right so your child has least side effects while I hope this helps you learn how to use towel now and motrin especially on how to alternate them when one or the other isn't working long enough so when I wish you good luck from dr. Tahir thank you for joining me today and I'll see you guys later",

        "video_title": "5 Hip Osteoarthritis Pain Relief Exercises, Seated",
        "video_sub_title": "hey everybody it's doctor jo and sleepy\u00a0 bear, and today i'm going to show you five\u00a0\u00a0 hip osteoarthritis exercises you\u00a0 can do seated. so let's get started.\u00a0\u00a0 so before we get started, if you haven't already\u00a0 make sure and click on the subscribe button down\u00a0\u00a0 there because it helps my channel grow.\u00a0 so these exercises can all be done seated\u00a0\u00a0 for your hip osteoarthritis the first one is\u00a0 just going to be a simple seated hip flexion.\u00a0\u00a0 it's just kind of how it sounds, but you want\u00a0 to make sure and keep your back upright and not\u00a0\u00a0 lean back into it. so if you need a chair with\u00a0 a back to help support your back, that's fine.\u00a0\u00a0 all you're going to do is just bring your knee\u00a0 up towards the ceiling getting that hip flexion.\u00a0\u00a0 you can alternate sides if you want to going back\u00a0 and forth, or you can just work one side and then\u00a0\u00a0 stop and work the other side. but again so you're\u00a0 not leaning back to bring that knee up, you're\u00a0\u00a0 really just going straight up trying to keep\u00a0 your back as as straight as you comfortably can. after you go into that, we're going to\u00a0 do a long arc quad or a knee extension.\u00a0\u00a0 and even though it's technically for the\u00a0 knee, the muscles that are getting work\u00a0\u00a0 go up into your hip as well so you really\u00a0 want to work these um as well. so with a\u00a0\u00a0 long arc quad or that knee extension is kind of\u00a0 again just how it sounds, you're kicking back,\u00a0\u00a0 or kicking up, excuse me, and straightening out\u00a0 your knee and then slowly coming back down. so\u00a0\u00a0 this looks easy, but again if you're doing it\u00a0 correctly if you're not leaning back into it,\u00a0\u00a0 if you need that chair make sure and use your\u00a0 chair, but when you come up pull your toes and\u00a0\u00a0 give that extra squeeze to activate that quad,\u00a0 and then slowly come back down. so it's not this.\u00a0\u00a0 if you do this it's going to be easy you can\u00a0 do them all day. you really want to go slow and\u00a0\u00a0 controlled. get that squeeze at the end and then\u00a0 nice and slow come down. you might have even seen\u00a0\u00a0 my leg shake just a little bit, so it doesn't take\u00a0 a lot. you don't have to use a whole lot of weight\u00a0\u00a0 you just have to control the motion. same thing if\u00a0 you want to alternate back and forth you can, or\u00a0\u00a0 if you want to do all of them that you're going to\u00a0 do on one side and then switch and do all of them\u00a0\u00a0 on the other side, you can do that as well. so the\u00a0 next one is going to work your inner muscles those\u00a0\u00a0 adductor muscles. you can use a ball, you can\u00a0 use a pillow, you can fold up a pillow, if you\u00a0\u00a0 don't have a ball. you can use a yoga block. those\u00a0 work really well, but you want it to be something\u00a0\u00a0 that's gonna keep your hips about hip or your\u00a0 knees about hip width apart. so you don't want to\u00a0\u00a0 be or something really small. you don't want to be\u00a0 something really big. you want it to be so you're\u00a0\u00a0 kind of almost in that neutral position. and then\u00a0 all you're going to do is squeeze in to the ball.\u00a0\u00a0 and you should feel that on the inside of your\u00a0 thighs and hold that for about three to five\u00a0\u00a0 seconds and then relax. so again you might have to\u00a0 shift it around a little bit so that ball doesn't\u00a0\u00a0 slide out. or you can just hold it and then\u00a0 squeeze in. when you're first doing these,\u00a0\u00a0 this is kind of what we would call an isometric\u00a0 exercise where you're activating the muscle but\u00a0\u00a0 not really moving it. so just start off\u00a0 with a little bit maybe even only 50%\u00a0\u00a0 of what you can do because you don't want to go\u00a0 all out and then end up getting yourself sore.\u00a0\u00a0 so i always tell people to start with a little bit\u00a0 and then progress their way up. so again holding\u00a0\u00a0 that for about three to five seconds and then\u00a0 relaxing. so the next one is going to be a hip\u00a0\u00a0 roll out. so you're using the muscles on the\u00a0 outside of those abductors. now you can use a\u00a0\u00a0 band if you want to to get more resistance, but\u00a0 i would say starting off you probably don't use\u00a0\u00a0 a band, but i'll i'll show you at the end the way\u00a0 you can do it with the band if doing a roll out is\u00a0\u00a0 um too easy for you. so keeping your knees\u00a0 about hip-width apart to start off with,\u00a0\u00a0 so you can come all the way in is a good way so\u00a0 you'll get that extra movement, but you're just\u00a0\u00a0 going to roll out keeping this one in one spot and\u00a0 then rolling back in. so you can either stop here,\u00a0\u00a0 or if you want that little bit more movement then\u00a0 you can roll all the way in. so rolling out and\u00a0\u00a0 then coming in. you can roll your foot out too,\u00a0 sometimes people ask me do you keep your foot down\u00a0\u00a0 the whole time. sometimes i do, but if i want that\u00a0 extra motion, if i'm feeling good in that hip you\u00a0\u00a0 can you can lift up your foot to roll it all the\u00a0 way out and i'll feel that extra stretch in there,\u00a0\u00a0 and then rolling it back in. again go slow and\u00a0 controlled. that's where you're going to feel the\u00a0\u00a0 exercise. if you're going fast, you're not really\u00a0 going to feel it if you want more resistance and\u00a0\u00a0 this will make it a lot tougher because you not\u00a0 only have to roll here but you're stabilizing\u00a0\u00a0 here. so same movement, but this time you try\u00a0 and keep this leg here and then you're rolling\u00a0\u00a0 out. so this time you're actually working both\u00a0 legs. so you're working them in different ways.\u00a0\u00a0 i'm rolling out this way, but i'm stabilizing\u00a0 the one that's not moving. and so again this\u00a0\u00a0 looks easy while i'm doing it, but it's a lot\u00a0 tougher than it actually is, so make sure you're\u00a0\u00a0 going slow. if you use a band, start off with the\u00a0 lightest one. so then the last one is going to be\u00a0\u00a0 where you're putting it around your feet. so now\u00a0 you're going to get that internal rotation of your\u00a0\u00a0 hip, and so when you're doing the internal\u00a0 rotation, you're actually bringing your foot\u00a0\u00a0 out. but you're not bringing your whole leg out,\u00a0 you're keeping your knee in about the same spot\u00a0\u00a0 and you're just turning it out here. so i can\u00a0 feel that a lot in my hip area. so again this\u00a0\u00a0 is one that if you're not quite ready to use\u00a0 the band, that's fine, you can do it without\u00a0\u00a0 the band and just kind of turn your foot out\u00a0 and come back in for that hip internal rotation.\u00a0\u00a0 but when you're ready you can put that band in\u00a0 there and then come out and back in. if this is\u00a0\u00a0 a little bit tough, you can put your foot down\u00a0 and then come back in, but eventually you want\u00a0\u00a0 to keep that foot up the whole time so you're\u00a0 getting that resistance the whole time. so there\u00a0\u00a0 you have it. those were five hip osteoarthritis\u00a0 exercises you can do seated. if you'd like to\u00a0\u00a0 help support my channel, make sure and

        "video_sub_title": "[Music] six although Megan cherry turns 20 this year she is still in many ways a typical teenager at least she was until about four years ago I felt dizzy but I didn't know what was the last thought I was just dehydrated so I got up to find my mom and to get a glass of water and that's the last thing I remembered at the age of 15 Megan had her first seizure before long she was having them every day as a parent it was very difficult to see your child go through seizures and everything else that went along with it because you want to fix it and you can't in all Megan tried nine medicines in various combinations to stop her seizures not only did they not work but their side effects were dramatic then her medical team at Cincinnati Children's made a suggestion we could see that her seizures were coming from the left side dr. francesca mangano is director of neurosurgery at Cincinnati Children's where a multidisciplinary team uses the most advanced technology to enable in many cases less invasive surgical removal of diseased brain tissue after a five-day evaluation the team discovered that Megan's seizure stemmed from the left side of her brain but if Megan was to become seizure free further testing was needed to pinpoint the exact location responsible for her seizures we could place a very small depth electrodes to very specific locations that would then give us further information when she started to have seizures dr. Mangano used stereo EEG robotic technology to help them implant the electrodes because of this particular technology he needed to make only a few small holes in her skull once those seizures occurred the electrodes that were implanted picked up that information and we were able to see the sacked location over seizures the focus of Megan seizures was deep in her brain but they were localized to two contacts on one electrode using the same robotic technology that helped pinpoint the seizures dr. Mangano re-entered an existing small hole and replaced the key electrode with a laser ablation catheter once we place the catheter in the exact position we can then heat the tip of that catheter and that he essentially kills the tissue that is causing the seizures after the surgery she's back to my old Megan and full of life and doing normal teenage things Megan is now seizure free she can drive a car and stay out late with friends all those things she hadn't been able to do in years it's awesome it's the best feeling because it's been such a long road it's crazy I'm so blessed you",

        "video_title": "Oxytocin-How to Increase Oxytocin, the LOVE Hormone, in 13 Natural Ways",
        "video_sub_title": "what if i told you it has been proven by increasing this hormone in your body you can have more love more confidence less fear more friends less stress and ultimately more happiness that hormone is right here it's oxytocin your friend Michael Unks here and you may find this hard to believe because I look like I'm 19 but I'm a pharmacist maybe you think i'm gonna tell you what drugs and supplements you need to take to increase oxytocin nope this video discusses 13 natural ways to have more love confidence and happiness by way of raising your oxytocin levels before we discuss the ways to raise oxytocin remember oxytocin help bring you into this world it's oxytocin that starts the labor process and if this doesn't happen naturally they actually give synthetic oxytocin to get the birthing process started and as long as your mom's biochemistry is normal oxytocin will be flowing after she gives birth and there will be a connection there that is indescribable she will love you no matter what but let's get back on track and discuss the first way to raise your oxytocin the first thing you could do is play soothing music it's possible you already do this let's take trying to be intimate with someone for example maybe earlier on in the evening you have a romantic dinner with candles wine and other stuff but later on you'll probably play soothing music likely from Marvin Gaye and that guy has a lot of hits so if someone's not in the mood they don't feel like connecting with you simply playing soothing music can help raise the oxytocin and build a connection pretty quickly that's why in future videos i plan on playing soothing music because i want to connect with you number two is sincere listening and when I say since you're listening I mean actually care what the person has to say not playing around on your phone not looking in the other direction not waiting for them to shut up so you can give your response if you actually listen and care about what they have to say both you and the other person will raise oxytocin you build a connection and your bond more number three is meditating there's one form of meditation that's been shown to raise oxytocin more than others it's called metta when you're meditating this is when you focus on loving others this has been shown to build a stronger connection than the standard mindfulness meditation there are many types of meditation but one that seems to work pretty well as where you hold your breath for eight seconds and then slowly release for 8 seconds repeat that for 10 minutes a day and if you do that first thing in the morning it can really call you down relax you and raise your oxytocin make you feel better give it a try sometime number four is using social media it's likely you do this anyway but just know that studies show that people who use social media have higher levels of oxytocin just remember to see your facebook friends and person to number five do something adventurous with another person and the more people the better whether it be skydiving watching a scary movie or jumping off a cliff it doesn't matter what adventurous activity you do you'll connect with the other person and actually in these moments it can help reduce your fear it's been proven that your amygdala has a major role in controlling fear and anxiety it's involved in detecting threat and linking them to defensive behaviour studies show that when you raise your oxytocin you temporarily decrease the response from the amygdala which will make you less fearful it was this one way that really sold me on that idea of doing whatever I could to raise my oxytocin because if you can take more risk in life you can have more success if you're interested in reducing your fear i can make future videos on that but back on track number six laughs more if you really want to laugh you should watch me try anything that relates to athletics it bums me out that I'm no good but at least it raises your oxytocin it makes you feel better and that's what I'm all about but an even better way is to watch a comedian these are my two favorites right here who are yours comment below number 7 eat these three foods bananas eggs and pepper there's not a ton of evidence to show that it raises oxytocin but it does seem to raise it someone so if you like these foods go for it because it can raise your oxytocin number 8 use the l word start saying I love you more oxytocin has also been referred to as the love molecule it's part of our biology to love others you've got to put it out there to get it back do it with friends maybe even at work and from personal experience sometimes you'll get this response if you don't know the person very well but just remind them that you're not in love with them you just love them as a friend number nine get a massage now that I think of it somewhere like this probably is a little shady maybe try some place like this instead but it doesn't matter where you go or what type of massage you get if you know what type of massage this is please comment below but getting massages relaxing it raises oxytocin and makes you feel better so treat yourself and get a massage number ten giving gifts studies showed that receiving gifts raise oxytocin but the best way to receive gifts is to give in the first place so just make it a regular practice even if it's for no reason in even if they get this small this can help you raise your oxytocin number 11 have a dog you know what he's not even snoop dogg anymore he's snoop lion but heading a real dog can raise your oxytocin this doesn't work unless the dog belongs to you but if you say that you're a dog person any dog can raise your oxytocin the dog will like it too once your oxytocin is up you'll connect better with humans around you as well number 12 hug more hugging not only raises your oxytocin but also reduces your cardiovascular stress and can even improve your immune system just tell people that you hug rather than shake hands and see what happens Dr. Paul Zak who did an incredible TED talk on the subject oxytocin by the way recommends eight hugs a day maybe think eight hugs a day is tough and maybe you think hugging in general is for hippies because they're all lovey dovey but I'm starting to think that there lovey dovey because they hug first hugging seems to be the best way in terms of physical contact and raising oxytocin and increasing connection with another person but all physical types of contact work as well a fist bump is a great example the thirteenth and final way to raise your oxytocin is to become more trustworthy this is probably the most challenging one because you can't force someone to trust you and I do want to be clear that trusting someone else doesn't raise your oxytocin it's being trusted by someone else from here to help you i'm gonna share a secret with you and i hope you keep the secret to yourself I trust you here it is gilmore girls is one of my favorite shows maybe people tease me about it but my sister recommend i check it out and it's a great show you have to check it out as well i just gave you an opportunity for me to trust you but now I want you to trust me I promise if you start applying these thirteen ways of raising your oxytocin discussed in this video you'll have more love confidence you'll take more risks you have more friends you have less stress and you'll have more incredibly fulfilling life if you like this video please like and comment below but I want you to trust me here I'm your friend I want you to succeed please subscribe to my channel by hitting a little circle above my fist and i will inspire you to be do and live better each video will be better than the next and i'm here to serve you this

        "video_sub_title": "hi I'm Brian Halvorsen and I'm a dentist I've been in practice for over 35 years and I have written a book about my principles on holistic dentistry the book is called great teeth for life in this video I talk about infected wisdom teeth and what you can do first thing I'd like to say the wisdom teeth are at the very very back of the mouth and literally start to grow into the mouth at normally about 1718 years old they're a throwback to Stone Age man when the rest of the teeth used to wear down and was enough room for them to grow in most modern jaws there's actually not enough room with me to grow and so what often happens is they grow half way through and then the gum gets inflamed and unfortunately infection this could be extremely painful followed with that phases and I thought she normally occurs especially with them students and possibly students at University now the name wisdom tooth actually is not because it's a particularly wise tooth it's because you know when the name was first thought about it actually occurred at a time when it was regarded at being at our wisest possibly at seventeen eighteen which is I think by today standard a little bit debatable now an infected wisdom tooth can be very very serious and the first line of treatment if the gun feels sore it isn't actually the tooth that's actually the thing that gets infected it's the gum around the tooth and the jaw bone underneath the wisdom tooth the tooth itself is often perfectly sound and there isn't any decay there is simply the gums got infected it is such a difficult area to clean but if you can if you have wisdom teeth coming through or you know of somebody who has a problem the first thing is as they're coming through even if they're not giving any trouble make sure that you brush the gum in and around and on top of the wisdom tooth this helps to remove any bacterial plaque if this doesn't work the next thing to do is to brush but also to actually use a good old fashioned remedy and that is to make up some very concentrated warm salty water now it is important to make it as concentrated as possible how you do this is possibly by taking an egg egg cup or say a whiskey tumbler a small container and actually fill it with hot water pour in the salt doesn't matter what sort of salt sea salt table salt doesn't matter it's the sodium chloride and just keep stirring it until you literally cannot get any more salt to dissolve why a small container well you don't really want a mouthful of salt over the whole lot so say for example it's this wisdom tooth here that's quit giving trouble pour it in lean over that way and then just sort of blow your cheek so your irritate ear agait ting the actual area that you want to do this for about a minute now the reason why it's important is the fact it allows the salt to act both as a local disinfectant but more importantly the there's a process called osmosis where in fact the concentrated salt draws out the fluid which is actually causing frankly the discomfort it's often not just infection it can just be just inflammation in in the gum tissue this hopefully will remedy most cases of infected wisdom teeth if it doesn't I'm afraid it's the next step or stop is actually visit the dentist and often he will assess the situation you may need a systemic antibiotic to get rid of the the pain and the swelling and then there's a decision made if in fact the wisdom teeth should remain in your mouth or actually be removed and this is something that you've often need to have a discussion with your dentist about I'm hoping that these tips will help you thank you",

        "video_title": "CPR and AED Use for Schools- Part 1- Hands Only CPR",
        "video_sub_title": "it's a scene that happens all too frequently in this country by our West Leonard collapsed on the court just moments after making the game-winning basket it will be at least a week before we know exactly what caused the sudden death of Hank Gathers this time it was 60 year old Robert Garza it happens roughly 75 times a year in the United States alone a student collapses and dies on the court or field when a tragedy like this happens people often think there's nothing they can do but there is immediate treatment before paramedics arrive with cardiopulmonary resuscitation or CPR and an automated external defibrillator or AED gives the victim the best chance at life sudden cardiac arrests can strike anyone at any age at any time playing basketball in the gym and I just collapsed I had no idea that I was at any risk and suffered a cardiac arrest luckily thankfully CPR was started right away and I'm here today because uh and I ran out here and Tory was on the ground and I just called 911 immediately Kerry Conger helped save Tory's life by starting CPR it took me a long time to come to terms with what I did I still have it completely it's still a complete shock that this happened toys such an amazing person and not someone I would ever pegye someone who would have cardiac arrest and not someone I would ever you know I wouldn't see her walking down the street and go she's gonna have cardiac arrest I never thought that CPR would have to be used on me and it saved my life I mean I'm so grateful for for that Tory was one of the lucky ones it is estimated that more than 95% of sudden cardiac arrest victims died before reaching a hospital resulting in approximately 250,000 deaths each year in the u.s. only one in four patients in cardiac arrest receives bystander CPR if CPR is performed you can double or triple a person's chance of survival based upon the overwhelming support for early bystander and community involvement the American Heart Association has revised their CPR guidelines to include hands-only CPR as the preferred method of resuscitation for the untrained bystander in addition there is an emphasis in the community to increase a IDI availability to ensure the likelihood of early defibrillation if you look at the curves that have been established for people survival in this setting what you find is only about 10% of the people will survive if they get shocked at eight minutes but if good chest compressions are started right away when the person goes down you can alter that that death curve if you will significantly such that people will respond to electricity for quite a bit longer and in fact at eight minutes if CPR started immediately at eight minutes we have more like a forty to fifty percent chance of saving someone's life over the next two periods we will train you to become effective responders in the case of sudden cardiac arrest you will be able to identify when to start chest compressions and how to perform them to ensure that they are high quality you will be trained to use an AED and where to find the AED in your school finally we will practice both CPR and AED use to ensure that any victims have the best chances for survival simply stated cardiac arrest is when the heart is no longer pumping blood through the body the victim is unconscious not breathing and has no pulse if not immediately treated the victim will most probably die cardiac arrest and heart attack are not the same thing a heart attack can cause a cardiac arrest but there are other causes what you need to remember is regardless of what caused the cardiac arrest good skills and rapid treatment are the keys to survival remember that every second counts for victims of cardiac arrest and at ten minutes after collapse they have a minimal chance of surviving so do whatever you can do as fast as you can do it the American Heart Association has simplified this urgency into the chain of survival one early access call 911 [Music] start chest compressions three early defibrillation use an AED for early advanced care paramedics in most cases paramedics can't respond and arrive at the patient's side quickly enough for the patient's sake now that AEDs are available to non-medical trained people you can become a vital link in this chain of survival new guidelines from the American Heart Association recommend hands-only or compression only CPR for non medically trained individuals fortunately these recommendations make CPR much easier to perform and dramatically increase the likelihood of a response from bystanders it has significant benefits in a lot of ways first of all it's a much easier way to do CPR so it's not that difficult to learn how to do it you don't have to try to coordinate breaths and chest compressions etc the other thing is that large studies have been done that show that what causes people to be reticent about doing a resuscitation on a neighbor loved one or someone who just goes down in the public is that folks are afraid of communicable diseases they don't want to have to do mouth-to-mouth resuscitation this new guideline is recommended only for adults in cardiac arrest it is not intended as the primary response for children or victims of drowning when adding breaths to chest compressions is still recommended although it is accepted that any effort is better than no effort everybody okay if you witness someone collapse immediately call 911 else to activate the emergency response system by calling 911 or rub their chest hard to get a response if you do not get a response start CPR immediately do not wait to check for a pulse position the patient with their back on the floor or ground place the heel of one hand over the center of their chest over the breastbone and placed your second hand with fingers interlocked over the first with your elbows locked apply a downward force by falling into the patient so that the motion is directed from your torso and not your arms high quality CPR consists of four critical variables depth of two inches rate of 100 full recoil of the chest minimal interruption most individuals can only perform high-quality CPR for two minutes before fatigue sets in to ensure that your victim receives only high-quality CPR you should switch providers every two minutes remember to coordinate the switch so that there is minimal interruption or no pause at all the reason why these criteria are important is to ensure the forward progression of blood flow to the brain by pressing two inches deep we ensure that the heart pumps blood effectively full recoil ensures that the heart fills completely for the next effective compression studies show that a rate of 100 compressions per minute is ideal to ensure forward flow of blood to the brain it's difficult for some people to remember 100 per minute to figure out what that is pretty unless they have a metronome so what I usually say is sing the song by the Bee Gees you know duh duh duh duh stay in Our Lives you sing it that they at the rate that they sang it then that pretty much will pay she at one hundred it takes several compressions to get forward progress of blood to the brain so any pause effectively becomes a loss of momentum and therefore make subsequent compressions less effective remember you can only help someone by performing CPR do not worry about breaking ribs or harming the victim of cardiac arrest studies confirm that minimal harm is incurred by individuals that require chest compressions and the benefits of CPR are life-saving and worth the risk but at the very worst you might break a rib or two but on the other hand if you save their life they're going to be grateful for a broken rib the goal of high-quality CPR is to improve the patient's response to defibrillation or electric shock and maintain blood supply to the brain CPR does not restart but we'll improve the likelihood of the heart responding to an electrical shock which will help the heart start beating again remember that high quality CPR directly improves an individual's potential response to a shock if that shock is provided within 10 minutes of collapse and high quality CPR is started immediately the individuals potential survival rate is dramatically increased without both of these interventions the death rate is nearly 100% so act quickly and activate the 911 systems immediately remember the four components of high quality CPR depth to inches rate of 100 compressions per minute full recoil and minimal interruptions",

The fingers and the thumb. Because, quite often when you have painful hands, you start to avoid using them as much as possible. And then they get weak, and then they get even more painful. - Compound in situation we need to stop it and reverse it possibly with some movement we're gonna show you. - So these are pretty easy exercises that won't be that hard on you. By the way, if you're new to our channel, please take a second to subscribe to us. We provide videos how to stay healthy, fit pain-free and we upload every day. Also go to bobandbrad.com go to the giveaway section. Right now we're giving away a Bob and Brad FitGLIDE. - Absolutely. Bob, - it's a pretty cool device but it's gonna show it in just a second. You'll find the contest also pinned at the top of the page at Facebook, go to Instagram, Twitter, or TikTOK if you want a 62nd version of our program. You got the FIC library? - Absolutely Bob. Here it is right in front of my eyes. Here let's show it at the profile. We set it down on the floor and you'll get some... This is arthritic knees will be all perfect. - And arthritic ankles. And you get a little bit of hip movement too. - You do. So the hamstring the quads are working and bonus. You can put it up on the stilt and it changes that makes a little more difficult. And not only that, Bob would get a little more tricky where the hamstring emphasis. - And let me say this right now. This thing will actually... It's fairly quiet. There's a little bit of swish, but it's very light. this is why you can lift it. You can lift it with one finger around five pounds. - But I would recommend this for the... - Arthritic can. - Yeah, arthritic can but you know... - Let's go to work, Brad. - That's right. - All right. So you are gonna need a little bit of dumbbell or something with a little bit of weight to start off with. I don't know if you could use a hammer. - Maybe if you've got that in your history, if you were a carpenter, very good thing. - So what you're gonna do exercise number one, your off the edge of a table while am on a stool here. - You think you could go off... - You can go off your knee absolutely. - Especially if you got an idea. - And you're gonna roll the weight down to the end of the fingers, and then you can lift it up and squeeze for three seconds one, two, three. Down, up squeeze for three seconds. Now you're gonna do 10 of these. Now I'm not gonna probably do all 10 in the interest of people's time and interest. But that's how many you do. You do this only three times a week. This whole set of exercises. And it's better to space them out like Monday, Wednesday Friday. - Be careful the first few times you do it, especially if your fingers are weak, cause we don't want it dropping it will land on your toe. - Now we're assuming that your hands are gonna be a bit weak and also because they're painful these are not real taxing exercises. I mean they're ones that you should be able to do. All right, next one. You have the same weight, and this time you're gonna grab it with all five fingers. (stool light bang) I usually support the arm like this Brad. And then lift it up like this. And all you're gonna do is hold it for three seconds. One, two, three. - So on a tabletop would probably be a nice place to do that. - One, two, three. - It's one of those exercises that looks very simple but it's real fun. I think it's one of those functional exercises giving you some strength, so you can do things like your writing you know, cooking. - And you know, of course we don't know your situation but you'd be surprised a lot of people might have trouble doing this sprout even. I mean, I can feel it. I mean, it's not nothing. That's for sure. - And you got these exercises from a book. - This was a book and it was researched. And they, they didn't just come up with these Willy-nilly. - Yeah. There is no Willy-nilly here. (laughs) - All right. Next one. This could be a little aggressive for some of you too. I mean, you might just start off by going like that without any resistance but you take a rubber band, just a regular old rubber band. And you just gonna spread your fingers apart like this. I'm making the some out to the side a little more. - Sometimes a little band if you'll go too wide it pops down your hand, but that's all right. Just don't go that far. - This one's going to be feeling a lot of people. - Now this is working these muscles on the back of the extensors which is important for opening that hand and grab things. - So 10 times on each one of these, by the way. I know I mentioned it once but I'll mention it again. So now we've got one for the thumb itself. So now you can... Look, what if we lie that (laughs) you place the thumb down onto a table like this. - That would be actually super nation position for the wrist. - And you're gonna bring the sum straight up in line with the first finger. I'll show it this way. So I'm bringing it straight up like this straight away from the first finger. We're trying to work a specific muscle on the thumb. And that's a very important muscle for stabilizing that joint. A lot of people have trouble with this joint right here on the thumb. It's a very active joint. It rolls a lot of different ways. So I want you to start off just doing 10 times with no weight. - So if the hand was like this, and you went out this way that would not be right... Away from that first finger. I have to think about that a little bit. - And now advanced, you actually would put the rubber band on it and just work the thumb going straight out like that. My thumb curls up when I do that one. I think it's almost too much for it. - That joint of mine, I mentioned to you before the video that I think I could benefit from this because it is a little uncomfortable and sometimes depending on what I do, I can get some sharp pain in there. I think it is a early onset of arthritis. - Well, I know that, you know again, this may seem very... They are simple and they may seem like they are not very difficult. But for some of you they will be. They'll be plenty enough and that way we can keep that arthritis in line. We'll be showing an exercise video to where we're doing range of motion for this finger. You've done them before too, bro. - This is why we were saying its probably for a more senior crowd you know, people 60 and above, but not always. - All right. Remember that I can fix just about anything. - Except for... - A broken heart. - There you go. But we will continue to endeavor the perseverance of the heart. - What does that mean? - Well, I don't know. I couldn't think of anything else to say, Bob. (laughs) - Thanks for watching.

        "video_title": "How to Boost Thyroid Function Naturally",
        "video_sub_title": "greetings everyone this is dr nicholas hedberg and in this video i'll be talking about how to boost thyroid function naturally so we're just going to talk about a few compounds that have been shown to work quite well in improving thyroid function so let's go ahead and jump right in uh the first one is ashwagandha ashwagandha is an adrenal adaptogen meaning that it helps to improve how your body adapts to stress it's also known as withonya somnifera aka indian ginseng so it is sort of in that family and it contains glycothianolide and this has been shown to reduce excessive cortisol levels and so if you have a thyroid problem too much cortisol is not your friend too much cortisol has a number of negative effects on thyroid function it has a negative effect on the brain and how your brain communicates with the thyroid it has a negative effect on the conversion of t4 into t3 so remember t3 is about four to five times more active than t4 and then cortisol can also affect the thyroid receptors in the cell and that can be problematic and then the last thing that it can do is it can increase reverse t3 levels and reverse t3 is very problematic in hypothyroidism because reverse t3 will bind to t3 receptors so it's basically blocking t3 and that can create the symptoms of hypothyroidism so there are a lot of people out there that have normal thyroid tests like their tsh looks normal they're t4 they're t3 but they have all the symptoms of hypothyroidism and one of the reasons that's happening is because no one bothered to check their reverse t3 and the reverse d3 might be very high and that's due to a tremendous amount of stress and cortisol in the body so ashwagandha it has been shown to increase t4 and t3 levels so in one study mice were given ashwagandha for 20 days and there was an 18 increase in t3 and 111 percent increase in t4 and they were given the root extract of ashwagandha and then a human study ashwagandha was given 500 milligrams for two months and that lowered the tsh which is a sign of improvement and then there was a 24 increase in t4 so as i mentioned stress increases reverse t3 and since ashwagandha can help to control your stress hormones like cortisol it can potentially help with those high reverse t3 levels so supplementation 500 milligrams is what they use in the study on humans and so that is a healthy dose there are higher doses that some people use but that's what the studies are showing at this time [Music] so our second compound is known as google extract comes from the uh it's known as combiforamuco and it's an extract from a sap from the indian mercury and so google has been shown to enhance the conversion of t4 into t3 through a compound found in the google uh known as ketosteroid so remember like i said earlier t3 is about four to five times more active than t4 so if we're enhancing our t3 levels then we're enhancing thyroid function now it has been shown to increase iodine uptake into the thyroid gland as well as enzymes in the thyroid now that may not be a good thing if you have hashimoto's disease and there's a lot of inflammation and your thyroid antibodies are very high it may not be a good idea to push extra iodine into the gland that could actually create more inflammation more problems and possibly an increase in your thyroid antibody levels so if that's happened to you this is one of the reasons the other thing is that google increases the activity of this enzyme it's called 5-prime deiodinase this is the enzyme that's involved in the conversion of t4 into t3 so that's a key enzyme in activating thyroid hormone and as i mentioned earlier actually too much cortisol can inhibit the this deiodonase enzyme and so it can have a negative effect on the conversion and then the last compound is korean ginseng also known as panax ginseng so it is an adrenal adaptogen just like ashwagandha so it is going to help with stress physiology and balancing your cortisol levels so it contains uh ginsenosides and these have been shown to support thyroid function so in one study we saw an increase in t4 and t3 and lowered reverse t3 levels now this was on patients with congestive heart failure and they were injecting a fermented form of korean ginseng and then in another study 500 milligrams was given to 80 females for eight weeks who suffered from cold hands and feet due to hypothyroidism and they had a significant increase in their skin temperatures so the cold hands and feet significantly improved on the ginseng and then the ginseng has also been shown to improve fatigue and low libido which are common symptoms of hypothyroidism so korean ginseng panax ginseng these are excellent adrenal adaptogens just like ashwagandha that can help to improve thyroid function again don't take these without dr supervision and remember what i said about the iodine uptake if you have hashimoto's regarding the google extract as a potential issue you can go to drhedberg.com and check out my thyroid e-course there where you'll get a lot more detailed uh helpful information that you can use to improve your thyroid function this is dr hedberg take care i'll see you at the next video",

have long hair or you know somebody who has long hair and they're wondering what's the best kind of brush or what's the best kind of comb hopefully this video will help you guys out so if you're interested in that please stick around okay so first I just want to give you sort of a little overview of the brushes and combs that I have so I guess we'll start from the left and they'll just go left to right so starting with this brush this is just a paddle brush and it is plastic and actually I brought it to show you guys kind of what not to get I don't like paddle brushes that are plastic because they tend to heat up the hair and break it and that causes more damage to the hair but I do find that this is nice every once in a while to use I just don't use it on a regular basis because it does break the hair but a paddle brush is actually pretty nice so the paddle brush that I do use and do recommend is a wooden paddle brush this is a wooden brush from bass and I will put a link in the description below for my Amazon affiliate link this brush is awesome this is a paddle brush and these are actual these bristles are actually made out of wood and so what happens is it does not heat up and therefore does not heat up and break the hair the wood actually will absorb some of your hairs natural oils and help to bring the oils from the top from your scalp down to the ends of your hair so I highly recommend this type of a paddle brush and a wooden paddle brush and that is this brush the green brush bypass so anyway that I will link in the description box this brush here is another wooden brush but the bristles instead are horse hair and I wish I remembered the name of this brush there on the company but I don't I bought this so long ago look it's like the finish is completely wearing off but this is a really nice brush for smoothing the hair and making it shiny and just a finishing brush if you will so I would look for a wooden brush that is either horse hair or boar bristle that will give you a nice brush that will be really good for smoothing and making your hair shiny and it also doesn't hurt so if you have kids and they like to brush your hair this is a really awesome brush for them to play with your hair with when when my kids want to brush my hair I say go get the good hair brush because that way even if I have tangles they can't they don't really hurt my head I'll say whack me with it which um has happened okay so next we're on two combs now my most favorite combs to use on my hair are these combs really wide tooth combs and this is called a cricket comb and when I bought this I bought this a long time ago when I was in beauty school but I just recently bought another one and so I have another one of these and the second one that I bought came with this fun little small one that you can put in your purse or you can clip it on to a carabiner and put it on your keychain which I thought was so cool but they have a nice little handle grip like a little can you see that it's like curved so that you can hold it really nicely and it is so awesome the wide tooth comb really goes through your hair very easily and it does not cause breakage then my next brush that my next comb that I like to use is this one which is a combination of a wide tooth and then a closer you know small tooth comb I like to use this one the wide tooth is really great for getting out tangles and then when I'm trying to straighten or smooth something down like a ponytail that is really nice the small small tooth section so this is a really great one plus I like to have this one in the shower and then I just can use it for whatever and and then I like to keep this one in my bedroom and this one in my purse so it gives me options the next comb that I like to use is just a basic small tooth comb you can see actually this one is whiter on the left and smaller on the right so it's just a smaller version of that and it's nice for smoothing down the hair and getting out smaller tangles and whatnot and then this one is really nice for braiding or for when you're doing a hairstyle and you need to section out your hair so you can use this tail to make parts and sections or whatever and then you can use the fine toothed to smooth it out and make it look really nice and lay flat if you want so those are that's an overview of the brushes that I recommend for long hair and the combs that I recommend so that's it guys those are the brushes that I use and the combs that I love if you have a brush or a comb that you love that works really well for your long hair or whatnot please leave it in the comments below I'd love to hear about it also if you have tried a wooden hairbrush before I'd love to hear about that too because I don't know very many people who have tried a wooden hairbrush I actually found out about wooden hair brushes from holistic puppets who is here on YouTube so I will put a link to her channel in the description box as well go ahead and go over there and check her out she's super awesome alright thanks so much for stopping by and you guys have a great day",

        "video_title": "How to Reduce Bloating Quickly - Causes of Bloating and Tips to Debloat Fast!!",
        "video_sub_title": "- Hey guys, Cassey here. Today, we're going to talk about bloating. I talk about the subject a lot on my TikTok because after I've had an incredible dessert full of added sugars, dairy, refined carbs, lots of gluten, my belly will turn into a food baby. And sometimes it's the cute and I'll turn to the side and put my hand underneath my low belly and pretend I am with child. And sometimes, well, most of the time, it's really uncomfortable. It makes me sluggish, lethargic, I just feel really weighed down and my clothes fit terribly. And I just feel not myself. And it is the worst when the bloat stays for a day or two, when I've really just overdone it. Now, of course, when I'm eating that dessert, I am making a conscious decision to eat it, knowing that the consequences will be a bloated belly and the sluggishness that comes along with it. So in today's video, we're gonna talk about what bloat is, how it's different than belly fat, what causes bloat, and what you can do to get rid of bloat. So if you're ready to dive in, let's do it. (upbeat music) Let's talk about where you feel bloated. So when you guys are eating a big meal and you tend to feel super full, that's when our stomach, which is right underneath our chest is getting filled up with food. Then when it moves down a little bit more into your small intestines and then for large intestines, eventually that's where we tend to feel bloated. And that's where we feel that food baby. And then kind of feel like we are with child. So why do we get bloated in the intestines? Well, you guys, when your food is being broken down and digested in your intestines, there is gas being produced while it's being broken down. And then the food also needs extra water to be in the intestine area to help push it through. So in with that mixture of gas and extra liquid, that is what creates bloat. So what that means is that as long as you're eating, you're going to feel a little bit bloated and that's totally normal. Everyone is going to feel that. But if you get the kind of bloat that makes you feel really uncomfortable and lethargic and sluggish, and really just not your best, then that's the kind of blow that I'm talking about here, because that's a kind of a little bit I get when I'm feeding my bodies with the foods that do not nourish it in the right way. Now that you know that excess water and air is giving you that bloated feeling, let's go over some common things that you could be doing to add in that extra air and water into your intestines. Swallowing air through chewing gum or drinking through a straw, eating too fast, eating too much, eating fatty foods, eating foods that create gas, constipation, also some medical conditions like lactose intolerance, Crohn's disease, celiac disease, and irritable bowel syndrome can make it harder to digest food. But what if you're not doing those things and you're still getting bloated? Isn't that the worst? Well you guys, sometimes there are healthy foods that make us bloated too. And as you know, every body is so different and reacts to food differently, but here are some common healthy foods that might make you bloated. Raw cruciferous veggies like cauliflower, kale, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, onions. Unfortunately, these things, as much as I love them, sometimes too much of them can make me really bloated, especially a lot of cabbage. Some fruits like apricots, apples, pears, peaches, and prunes, beans, and lentils, and whole grains. And then some of your more obvious bloat foods like greasy fatty foods, foods with artificial sweeteners, look for sorbitol on the label, carbonated beverages, the air bubbles and salty foods and processed foods that tend to be really high in sodium. So things that are canned and a lot of times, lots of frozen food. So back to the healthy foods list, why in the world world would a healthy food make you bloat? Well it's because it has a lot of fiber, which is awesome. But what that means is that it is a little bit harder to digest than other foods, which means there might be a little bit more gas production when the body is trying to break down the food and these foods tend to draw in more water. So there you go again with the extra air and the extra water you get that bloated feeling. So how can you tell the difference between bloat and belly fat? So you guys, have you ever had a super indulgent meal and then you decide to weigh yourself afterwards. Not the best idea, but I've done it before. And I've gained up to like seven pounds after one crazy meal, but so fun, because no one can ever believe that I can eat that much, but I actually can't eat that much. Anyway, different story for another time. You guys, if you have just one indulgent meal, it's not actual fat that you're gaining, that extra weight on the scale is excess water, the literal weight of the food that you just ingested, and you guys it's excessive calories over time that is going to make you gain body fat, not one indulgent meal. So if you are thinking that you gained a ton of fat from one meal, that's not true, that is most likely bloat and you kind of just need to go to the bathroom and you'll be back to normal. Maybe your face might be a little puffy from the excessive sodium and stuff, but drink a lot of water with lemon and you're going to be fine. So when it belly fat? Well, if you are not being active regularly, if you are sleep deprived, if you are stressed out, if you're eating an excessive amount of calories and you just feel like you're not at your best, well, that's probably the belly fat that is coming into play. It happens over time and does not happen over night. Here's some common questions to ask yourself if you're not sure if it's bloat or belly fat. Let's go through this quickly. Is my belly suddenly bigger than it was a day or two ago? Probably bloat. Does my tummy slim back down the next morning? Probably bloat. However you guys, when I eat a crazy dessert at night, my bloat doesn't go away the next morning at all. It stays all day the next day and then goes away the following day. So it actually takes my body two days to recover from an intense indulgent meal. When did I last go to the bathroom? If it's been a day or two, it's probably bloat. Are you on your period? Probably bloat. Are you dehydrated? Probably bloat. Basically, it's probably bloat unless you've noticed changes all over your body. And again, gaining belly fat is going to take time and also is a reflection of your current lifestyle, not just one indulgent meal. Now that you know what causes bloat, how do you get rid of it? You guys, you know I am a huge fan of journaling. And through my 90-day journey, I was able to figure out exactly the things that bloat me. So if you're not sure how to do that, basically you can start journaling in any notebook, you can get the 90-day journal or can do it on a piece of paper or a spiral notebook, whatever works for you. Write down what meals you're eating throughout the day, and then write down how you feel after each meal and how you feel the next day. Because I did that and was so precise with what I ate. I noticed that anytime I had dairy, I would break out with pimples. Any time I had gluten or refined grains, I would bloat really intensely and feel super sluggish. And anytime when I feel like I wasn't eating enough, I'd be super hangry. So literally write down what you're eating and how you feel, because this is how you are going to figure out what foods work for your body and what foods do not. And again, it's going to be different for every body. This is your individual journey, and this is something you need to discover for yourself. That is obviously something that's going to take extra time and effort, but if there are some things you want to implement right now, the first thing you can try doing is try to eat more slowly so that you're swallowing less air as you're eating your food. You could also try deep breathing to stimulate the digestive track and also to relieve the pain and discomfort. You can also sip on a warm beverage or drink some prune juice if you're feeling constipated, I just really want you to stay away from laxatives as well as stimulant teas, like those skinny teas and fit teas because you can be really dependent on that. And if you do rely on that to go to the bathroom, it's going to make it harder to go naturally in the future. So please, please try to be really natural about this. You can also give yourself a colonic massage to move that food waste in your intestines along. It might just need a little bit extra physical stimulation. You can also strengthen your core, and if you're dealing with more intense bloating issues, it might be a good time to contact your doctor and walk through some other options that might be good for your body. Now you understand what bloat is, but if you are still dealing with belly fat or combination of belly fat and bloat, well, let me tell you how you can get rid of belly fat. So, first thing to understand is that you cannot spot reduce fat. You definitely can spot tone and work on a certain muscle group, but when it comes to fat, you guys are going to be losing fat all over your body at once, okay? Maybe at different rates in different places. Like for example, for me, I lose fat easily in my arms, but my low belly is really hard. And you know what, when you lose fat, you can't choose. You're gonna lose fat from your face, but also from your boobs and your butt. You know, guys, it all comes all together, melting all at once. But how do you do it? It's a combination of your workouts, your nutrition, your sleep levels and your stress levels. Working all together. And basically you guys, what you need to do is make sure that you are active at least a few times a week. I like to work out pretty much every day because it makes me feel good, because when I feel good, my body is moving, my mind is sharp and it makes me just more motivated in life, okay? So that is the workout part. Make sure that you are enjoying it and that it is something that is making you stronger mentally and physically, because that is really important, okay? And look, it doesn't even have to be my workout videos. It could be any workout video out there that makes you happy and that makes you feel like you want to wake up and just do it because that is going to be the most important thing, consistency. All right, let's talk about that nutrition. So I just released the 90-day meal plan guide. And if that is something that you need a little bit extra help on, I wrote it with my RD. So you can follow that: there's four different types of meal plans. You can choose what works for you and your dietary preferences. But in there you will learn how to calculate your caloric needs for your goals, for your activity level, for your height and age and gender and all that kind of stuff, because it is going to be different for every person. But the main thing to understand here is that even if you are eating healthy, but you are eating excessive calories, you are going to find that it's going to be hard to lose weight. And that is something that I dealt with, because I just like to eat a lot and yeah maybe eat a lot of kale chips or eat a lot of cauliflower rice. But when you eat a lot, it's still becomes excessive energy in your body, which then makes your body hold onto extra fat. Now, totally, it depends on what your goals are. If you're totally happy with where you are, then good. But if you feel like you have extra belly fat or extra fat to lose, then you are really going to want to dial it in and figure out what is it that is making you hold onto that stubborn fat. And you know what you guys, it's not really a simple calories in calories out situation, it has a lot to do with your hormones too, and that's why the sleep and the stress comes into play. Because when I was really on my game when it came to and food, and I just couldn't change my body, it was because I wasn't sleeping enough. And I was super stressed out due to not sleeping enough and working too much. And my body was just out of whack and it just wasn't like an equation anymore. So make sure you are really paying attention to how you're working out, making sure that it makes you happy, how you are eating, eating for your goals, but also making sure that your food makes you happy, 'cause if you're not happy, you're gonna be stressed, and if you're stressed, you can't change your body. So you know, it all plays together. Okay you guys? So pretty much that is the whole story on bloat and belly fat. I hope this video helped you understand better what the difference is and what you can do about it. And lastly, I just want to say that if you're feeling bloated, it's okay. It's normal, just like I said, but if it's making you feel uncomfortable, there are things that you can do about it. And at the end of the day, I just want you to look in the mirror and love yourself. Whether it's with a cute food baby or without it love every inch of your body, because our body is fluid. It reacts to food. Food is more than just energy. It's cultural, it's delicious, it's joy. So allow that beautiful relationship and interaction with food to happen. And yeah, I dunno. Sometimes when I have an amazing meal, I do like to look down at my belly and be like, yeah, you did a really good job. And you know, and just give a nice little pat. I don't know, you guys. Just enjoy what you're eating and enjoy your fitness journey and just know that you're amazing, I love you so much. And if you want to check out some more videos, go ahead and click right here and keep watching and I'll see you in our next workout. Okay, you guys? I'll see you later, bye.",

Shawn Hashmi with Kaiser Permanente I'm a practicing oncologist in Woodland Hills California so today I thought I'd talk to you guys about painful bladder and how do you relieve bladder pain specifically so here's the thing about bladder pain in order to answer a question that's so complicated we have to start off with the anatomy a little bit so let's start off from the outside and work our way backwards a little bit so first question is what are the sources of bladder pain to begin with so the most common sources can start from the outside so you can have problems with the urethra which is the opening point not so there can be strictures there they can be irritation there you can have urinary tract infections occurring in that area including the bladder or even extending all the way up to the kidney so these are some common sources other things can include things such as cancers so you have to look for those things kidney stones and last but not least a syndrome that's more of an exclusion syndrome which is called painful bladder syndrome so when we talk about treatment we have to address each one of these so if you're talking about kidney stones going on common treatments include making sure you're getting adequate hydration going on making sure that we are checking to see what the stone composition is so we can treat it appropriately if you're talking about a urinary tract infection oftentimes your doctors may give you things like antibiotics they may prescribe things like cranberry juice which is over-the-counter drinking a little bit every day can help prevent some of that bacteria from sticking to the walls but if we can't find a source for it and if you find that every single time your bladder starts to fill up you're starting to have pain then that can be a sign of info bladder syndrome like I said this is more of a diagnosis of exclusion so what does that really mean or painful bladder syndrome it's very tough to diagnose it's also very tough to treat there's a lot of triggers that can be associated with it a common thing is certain foods in some people coffee your caffeine can be associated alcohol can do it foods such as high in potassium foods like strawberries can certainly do it so avoiding these types of foods can actually help relieve that some people find and voiding more frequently so having to go to the bathroom a lot can actually help out there symptoms too often times us because as the bladder fills up that is what causes pain so common ways to alleviate pain is hydrate yourself this will prevent infections another easy thing to do is avoid foods that you find trigger your abdominal pain that can help too if you have a history of kidney stones see your doctor so we can check for that and help you out with that sometimes your doctor may prescribe medicines such as a tricyclic antidepressant to help in situation where they think this is painful bladder syndrome sometimes they may even refer you to physical therapy to help with strengthening muscles in that area which can also help in terms of bladder pain once again this is dr. Shawn Hashmi with Kaiser Permanente and thank you very much today's topic was how to relieve bladder pain",

        "video_sub_title": "with all this talk on diastasis recti the next obvious question would be is diastasis recti preventable and the answer is yes it is definitely preventable during pregnancy [Music] most of the conversation around diastasis recti as well as pelvic organ prolapse and other pelvic floor issues during pregnancy are about women healing or managing these issues after baby and this is wonderful however we are doing a disservice by not telling women that all of these issues are actually preventable during pregnancy so in this video I'm going to run through five ways that I help my clients prevent diastasis recti as well as other pelvic floor issues during pregnancy so the first step is learning how to breathe diaphragmatic ly diaphragmatic breathing is the way we were designed to breathe 24/7 so learning how to breathe with the entire inner core unit the diaphragm the TVA as well as the pelvic floor is going to help you gain the awareness of these muscles and also use the inner core unit in a functional way the second step is learning how to recruit the inner core unit during activities of daily life so you're only exercising maybe 30 to 40 minutes three or four times a week but it's the activities of daily living that have the most impact on the inner core unit in the pelvic floor so learning how to recruit these deep muscles during certain activities like bending over to pick up something heavy having a bowel movement when you cough or sneeze that's going to be essential and kind of reprogramming the way that you manage your pressure so in a properly functioning core the inner core unit would remain reflexive meaning it will happen or the inner core unit will contract prior to a certain movement however for many women they just don't have this awareness of the connection so being really mindful and recruiting the muscles during these types of movements our activities is going to help kind of reprogram everything it's going to retrain the core to work in a more supportive way the third step is going to be protecting the integrity of the Lyne album so avoid any exercises that put a ton of pressure through the midline of the Linea Alba or cause any type of doming now this is going to be different for every single body there's no safe or unsafe list that I can give you and I'll talk about that more in another video but being mindful and aware of the certain exercises and just checking in with the core and looking at your body seeing how your body is responding to a certain exercise is essential and maintaining that facial integrity of the core the fourth step is learning how to regulate the intra-abdominal pressure during exercise so we talked about how during pregnancy the weight of the baby is going to increase the intra-abdominal pressure so it's essential that we learn how to regulate or maintain this pressure in a safe way during exercise or when the body is under load the fifth step is tension to task this is a concept that was created by Anthony Lowe a physical therapist and the idea is that you only recruit the pelvic floor and the inner core unit with as much tension that you need to complete the task at hand so for example a body weighted squat would require less core tension than a barbell squat so learning how to recruit the inner core in different intensities is important whenever you're training during exercise because you don't want to over recruit or over tighten the pelvic floor the core all the time so I hope this list was helpful for you guys if you have any questions or comments please leave them below and be sure to subscribe for more videos like this",

Wahby how are you doing Ellis Mars today I'm hoping to help the Harper family but to identify if they have an underlying mold related issues all right so we're gonna get you set up for the allergy testing and the breathing test and I'll take a look at it and as soon as I analyze and review it I'll give you a call we'll go over to the doc all right thank you thank you really deep in and then blast it out about ten more seconds little bit bathroom three two one exhale out good job did it hurt it hurt less than the bird underwater hi dr.

        "video_title": "How to reduce your hunger hormone [ghrelin] and PREVENT WEIGHT REGAIN!",
        "video_sub_title": "Losing weight is hard but keeping it off can be even harder. I\u2019ve heard time and time again from women who have lost the same 20 or 30 pounds multiple times in their lives. Why is it so hard to keep the weight off? Why on earth does it seem to take forever to lose weight, but then it can come back on so fast? There are several reasons for weight regain, and today I\u2019m focusing on a major player...a little hormone called ghrelin. Also known as your hunger hormone. Have you ever lost weight and struggled with your appetite? Like you were constantly hungry, or your hunger increased after losing weight, making you feel like you\u2019re swimming against the current to stick to your plan? Have you ever tried intermittent fasting but felt like you had uncontrollable hunger and weren\u2019t able to fast for as long as you would have liked? Knowing how ghrelin works, and using the 3 tips I\u2019m going to share with you today, will help with your fasting efforts, and arm you with vital information to keep the weight off. Ghrelin\u2019s primary role is to stimulate your appetite, slow your metabolism, and increase your fat storage. Not surprisingly, ghrelin levels will rise after a period of dieting, specifically with chronic calorie restriction. Said differently, your hunger hormone goes up after you lose weight to stimulate your appetite and try to make you regain your weight. It\u2019s not fair is it? Ghrelin is just one of the many reasons why eat less, exercise more doesn\u2019t work for lasting weight loss. In this episode, you\u2019ll learn three tips to lose weight in a way that helps reduce ghrelin levels so you\u2019re less hungry, less likely to regain the weight you worked so hard to lose, and can increase your fasting window. Be sure to watch all the way until the end for a couple bonus pieces of information you won\u2019t want to miss. I\u2019m Dr. Morgan Nolte, founder of the Weight Loss for Health Online Course, Community, and Coaching program. I help women in perimenopause and postmenopause reverse insulin resistance to lose weight and prevent disease. If you haven\u2019t already, please take a moment and subscribe to my channel, like this video, and leave a comment. I would greatly appreciate it because that engagement helps this video get seen by more people, so thank you in advance for helping me spread the word. Ghrelin is a hormone produced in your stomach. Ghrelin acts at the hypothalamus, an area of the brain that controls appetite, and on reward processing centers of the brain. Think of ghrelin as your appetite stimulating, weight gaining hormone. When your ghrelin levels go up, you\u2019ll sense more hunger and want to eat more food. Plus, ghrelin slows your metabolism down and causes more of the food you eat to be stored as fat. Ghrelin is more than just your \u201chunger hormone\u201d and has effects on muscle, bone, heart and even cancer. But for the purpose of this episode, I\u2019m just reviewing its role in weight management. While there are at least 14 hormones that regulate appetite and satiety, ghrelin is a major player and worth understanding on a deeper level. Ghrelin is released in a pulsatile pattern, meaning that it rises and then it falls again. Some literature states that ghrelin rises before a meal and falls after you eat. However, new research is challenging that assumption and suggesting that ghrelin, like many other hormones, has its own circadian rhythm, often corresponding to a person\u2019s normal meal times. Chronic calorie restriction diets and sleep deprivation also lead to more ghrelin and an increased appetite. You may think that not eating for a while - like through intermittent fasting - would stimulate your appetite as well, but research is showing otherwise. My first tip for you to reduce your ghrelin is to use intermittent fasting, also known as time-restricted feeding. Take a look at this graph from a study that measured fasting ghrelin levels every 20 minutes for 24 hours. There are a couple of important things to note here. First, ghrelin levels are usually lowest around 9 in the morning. Recall that this is also generally the longest period of the day where you haven\u2019t eaten. This reinforces the fact that hunger is not directly related to how long you go without food. At 9 AM, you have not eaten for about 14 hours, yet you are the least hungry. Eating does not necessarily make you less hungry. When I\u2019m intermittently fasting, I\u2019ll notice very little hunger for the 16 to 18 hours of fasting, but once I start eating for the day I\u2019m hungrier the rest of the day. Often I\u2019ll tell women to skip breakfast to extend their fast and they say, \u201cWait a minute, I thought breakfast was the most important meal of the day to boost my metabolism!?\u201d I won\u2019t get into specifics here, but I tell them that\u2019s just good marketing by food companies. Very often they\u2019re relieved and tell me they were never hungry for breakfast in the first place, but felt like they should eat it because that\u2019s what everyone else does and that\u2019s what other weight loss programs taught them to do. Now you see from the research, hunger is indeed lowest in the morning after the initial peak before our normal breakfast time, which is possibly why breakfast is the easiest meal of the day to skip if you want to start intermittent fasting. If you can just ignore the hunger first thing in the morning, chances are you\u2019ll easily make it closer to lunch before you\u2019ll notice hunger again. Next, notice how there are three distinct peaks that correspond to our normal meal times. This indicates that there is a learned pattern to ghrelin\u2019s release. If you\u2019re used to eating at 8:00, 12:00, and 6:00, you\u2019ll get hungry about those times. This can help you mentally prepare for hunger around your normal meal times when you\u2019re fasting, and expect the hunger to pass relatively quickly. Another study showed that over 3 days of fasting, ghrelin gradually decreased. This means that patients were far less hungry despite not having eaten for the past three days. This study also showed a clear circadian rhythm to ghrelin and highlights the fact that hunger \u201ccomes in waves\u201d Notice in this graph, men are the white bar and women are the black bar. Research has shown that women have a higher amount of ghrelin, which may be why we tend to feel stronger food cravings compared to men...rarely do I hear my husband say, \u201cI just need some chocolate.\u201d Both men and women had a significant decline in ghrelin, but the women showed a greater overall decline than men after this three day fast. I often hear from women that they thought fasting would be so hard, but in fact it\u2019s easier than they anticipated, especially if they follow my recommendations of priming with protein the day before a fast, staying distracted, and being well hydrated. I\u2019ve been doing a 24-hour fast once a week for the last couple months and hope to make this a regular part of my lifestyle. I was most surprised that my hunger didn\u2019t compound. I thought each hunger wave would get bigger and bigger until I couldn\u2019t take it anymore and just succumbed to the food. And these graphs reflect what I felt and what many of my clients feel, the ghrelin and hunger level gradually decreased over the day. A few other notes about the hormonal changes of fasting. Notice that cortisol does go up during fasting. That\u2019s because fasting is a hormonal stressor on your body. I never do my 24-hour fast unless I\u2019m well rested. It\u2019s going to be harder due to increased ghrelin and cortisol levels. If you\u2019re not sleeping well, don\u2019t beat yourself up if fasting seems hard for you. There are plenty of strategies to make it easier, but first and foremost focus on improving your sleep. Insulin also goes down, which is great because it allows your body to tap into stored energy for fuel and helps reduce insulin resistance. One study showed that people who fast for 24 hours once a month are about half as likely to be insulin resistant and develop diabetes as those who don\u2019t. Growth hormone goes up during fasting to help preserve your muscle when you\u2019re fasted. This is why intermittent fasting is one of the best weight loss strategies, and when you pair it with proper nutrition, you\u2019re well on your way to losing weight, reducing belly fat, and lowering inflammation. My second tip for you to keep ghrelin low is to mind your macros. Different types of macronutrients will affect ghrelin differently. The food you put into your mouth impacts your hunger and satiety after that meal. There are three types of macronutrients - carbohydrates made up of fibers, starches, and sugars, proteins, and fats. If you want a specific foods list I recommend, go to www.weightlossforhealth.com/ultimatefoodguide and download it for free. This study found glucose (a type of carbohydrate), consistently caused a decrease in ghrelin levels. Protein had no effect on ghrelin, and fat caused a significant decrease in ghrelin levels but only in women. Wait just a second because this is not a green-light to go eat a bunch of carbs and expect to have less hunger. Cholecystokinin (CCK) and peptide YY are two hormones involved in short\u2010term regulation of food intake and are also impacted by the type of food you eat. CCK and peptide YY are triggered by protein and dietary fat, but not starches and sugars. I like to say this is why we always have room for dessert even after a huge meal - because those simple carbs don\u2019t trigger our satiety hormones. To eat in a way that will significantly reduce ghrelin (or hunger) and increase your satiety (or fullness), it\u2019s important to include protein and healthy fat in your meal. If you just have a meal or snack that\u2019s primarily carbohydrates, like cereal, oatmeal, a granola bar, or even just fruit, you\u2019re not going to be triggering your satiety hormones, and further, you\u2019re going to cause a blood sugar spike, which inevitably leads to a drop, and that drop in blood sugar will make you want to eat again. Normally, after we eat, ghrelin levels go down so we aren\u2019t hungry anymore. But research has shown that in people who are obese with insulin resistance, their ghrelin doesn\u2019t go down as much as someone with a healthy BMI and better insulin sensitivity. Certainly not all people with obesity eat an excess of food, that\u2019s not the only cause of weight gain, but many of them do report they struggle with appetite control, and this suppressed reduction in ghrelin following a meal may be one of the reasons why. Interestingly, the study found that this phenomenon of a suppressed reduction in ghrelin only occurred after a glucose load. In contrast, the presence of obesity did not alter ghrelin response to the lipid or protein loads. Remember there that ghrelin (or hunger) was significantly reduced after eating fat, and was not affected after eating protein. I cannot emphasize enough the fact that all calories are not created equally. In previous episodes I\u2019ve talked about how different types of calories affect insulin differently, and this episode proves that they also affect your hunger and satiety differently. And it\u2019s common sense really. Think about how full you feel after eating 500 calories of chicken versus 500 calories of cake. It\u2019s so important to eat real, whole foods and reduce your consumption of processed sugars and starches to reduce your insulin resistance. My third tip for you to reduce ghrelin is to get some sleep! Sleep deprivation will result in higher levels of ghrelin. As you can see from this study, short sleep duration not only led to increased ghrelin, or hunger hormone, but also contributed to reduce leptin, or satiety hormone. When it comes to weight gain, sleep deprivation is at least a triple whammy. Sleep recharges your willpower battery. Not only will you have higher levels of ghrelin making you more hungry, and reduced levels of leptin making you feel less full, you\u2019ll also have reduced self-control and willpower, making it more likely you\u2019ll overeat. Remember how I said if you hung around till the end I\u2019d share some bonus pieces of information with you? Well we\u2019ve made it to the bonus round! If you know me, you know I\u2019m always asking the questions \u201cwhy?\u201d and \u201chow?\u201d I like to know the physiology behind what I teach so I want to briefly explain how ghrelin causes a rise in blood sugar and fat storage, ultimately contributing to insulin resistance. There are three types of adipose, or fat, tissue: white, beige, and brown. Brown adipose tissue is brown because it has more mitochondria in the cells. Mitochondria are the energy producing parts of the cell. Brown adipose tissue actually burns energy. Compared to adults, babies have a higher amount of brown adipose tissue...one of the reasons my little Leah whose 9 months old is always so snuggly and warm. White adipose tissue is the storage type of fat. Beige fat falls in the middle and acts more like brown fat to burn energy. Ghrelin will reduce the metabolic activity of brown fat, essentially slowing your metabolism. Ghrelin has a two-pronged effect on white fat. Ghrelin will cause your body to make more white fat, a process known as adipogenesis, and reduce it\u2019s breakdown, or lipolysis. More fat than your body needs leads to inflammation and insulin resistance. Ghrelin\u2019s effect on the pancreas serves to raise blood sugars. To do this, ghrelin reduces insulin secretion. I know this sounds counterproductive because increased insulin leads to weight gain, but remember this short-term reduction in insulin allows for increased blood glucose. Insulin\u2019s job is to allow blood glucose to move from the bloodstream into the cell, but ghrelin wants to increase blood sugars, at least in the short term, so it inhibits insulin. At the same time, ghrelin will cause an increase in glucagon from the pancreas. Glucagon is the opposite of insulin. While insulin wants to lower blood glucose, glucagon wants to raise it. Glucagon signals the liver to create more glucose. What happens is that your blood sugars go up, and then your insulin will be released to bring them back down. Anything that stimulates an increase in blood glucose will ultimately increase blood insulin, leading to an increased risk for insulin resistance and a higher body set weight. I covered a lot in this episode and wanted to be sure you were clear with takeaways so let\u2019s recap the main points. First, ghrelin is also known as your hunger hormone. It increases after a typical chronic calorie restricted diet, or when sleep deprived, and makes you want to regain the weight. Ghrelin is pulsatile in nature and seems to be released in conjunction with your normal meal times. Intermittent fasting helps lower ghrelin levels. Knowing that your hunger will increase around normal meal times, you can be proactive and ensure that you\u2019re properly hydrated and distracted around those times to ride the hunger wave until it passes. Remember that intermittent fasting isn\u2019t about eating less, it\u2019s about eating less often. Food absolutely still matters. Eating a diet high in healthy fat significantly helps lower ghrelin. Including plenty of protein in your diet will also help stipulate other satiety hormones including CCK and peptide YY. For obese individuals with insulin resistance, your ghrelin supresssion is going be blunted after eating refined starches and sugars, meaning you can anticipate hunger again quickly after eating those kinds of foods. Set yourself up for success by avoiding or reducing these processed carbs. Sleep is crucial for weight loss and maintenance success. Getting enough sleep can help reduce your ghrelin levels and make intermittent fasting a lot easier. You can\u2019t out diet and exercise the negative hormonal effects of chronic stress or sleep deprivation. I hope you enjoyed today\u2019s episode. If you have any other questions about ghrelin, put them in the comments below. Thanks for watching and I\u2019ll see you soon in the next video!",

        "video_sub_title": "[MUSIC] One day I just had this uncontrolled pain in my stomach that brought me to my knees, and from there on is history. I went to my doctor, and one test led to another, led to another, but just my gut feeling told me something was wrong, and me trying to self diagnose, and treat myself just wasn't good enough any more. [MUSIC] I was diagnosed with stage 3C adenocarcinoma of the stomach, which is not, outcomes are not good. Prognosis is very poor. And the thing that I appreciated was that my surgeon, Dr. Duncan, he verbalized all this to me. He was very up front, this is how serious the situation is, however, you don't fit that mold, so you're gonna read all this stuff on the Internet. You're gonna see all these articles coming out, but just remember you don't fit that mold. Within my surgery, my entire stomach was removed. And he did this [INAUDIBLE] procedure so he was actually able to make like a little pouch, I call it my pseudo tummy, out of my intestine. So the first couple of years, like I'd say the first year and a half, was very difficult because I was still very much in my old habits where I could eat anything and everything. I could eat as much as I wanted. And it was very hard habit to break. [MUSIC] So I met my fiance, it was after I was finally done with my chemotherapy, and we went out for a football game. I was meeting up with mutual friends of ours and he happened to have been there, and I was there, wigged up and all, and we just hit it off. [MUSIC] At the time when I was diagnosed, I was getting ready to apply to PT school, to do physical therapy. And of course having to put all of that on hold, and then to be kinda thrown into this new life and this new journey, and coming across all of these wonderful men and women that just had such a positive impact on my life. I just knew that I could do something more, that I knew I was gonna come out of this and I needed to give it back. So I am now an oncology nurse at the local hospital that I did my chemo treatments at. I was very inspired throughout my journey by all of the medical staff that was a part of it, especially the nurses. [MUSIC] Eric and I will be getting married October 3, 2015. And I wanted to wait. We've been engaged already for a year. But I wanted to wait in particular because I will be at my five year, hallelujah, it's over mark next October. So we have all these plans to go ahead and I'll have my PET scan done and then that, I can close the book to that chapter and move forward. And that will be my whew, it's okay to move on. That will be my moment, and so celebrating in five years by getting married and having all my closest friends and family there. Dr. Duncan's gonna be there even, so, I mean what better way to celebrate than a celebration of our love, and then just a celebration of life. Because I can now breathe a lot easier, so [LAUGH], it's pretty significant to us. [MUSIC]",

        "video_title": "Pancreatic Exocrine Insufficiency | Gastrointestinal Society",
        "video_sub_title": "When the pancreas is healthy it produces enzymes to help break down food and secretes them into the small intestine. There are different enzymes to digest carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. If you have pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, then your pancreas doesn\u2019t make enough enzymes to break down all the food you eat into absorbable components. Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency is a condition that occurs as a complication of pancreatic damage. The most common causes of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency are chronic pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, pancreatic cancer, type 1 diabetes, genetic disorders such as cystic fibrosis, inflammation from digestive diseases such as Crohn\u2019s disease or celiac disease, and complications from some surgeries in the digestive tract. Most pancreatic exocrine insufficiency symptoms result from not absorbing enough nutrition from food. Too much unabsorbed fat in the intestine causes stools that are oily, large, pale, very foul-smelling, and tend to float in toilet water and stay in the toilet bowl, even after flushing. This is known as steatorrhea. Fatty stools can also lead to fecal incontinence or oily leakage, intestinal gas, and bloating. Nutritional deficiencies are common, especially of the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency can also cause weight loss. In children, these factors can result in a failure to thrive. Some symptoms of nutrient malabsorption include fatigue from not enough calories or various nutritional deficiencies, anemia from vitamin B-12 or iron deficiency, bone disease from vitamin D deficiency, and bleeding disorders from vitamin K deficiency. When it comes to treating pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, the first and most important step is to identify and manage the underlying cause. These treatments will vary. However, there are options available to treat the symptoms of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency itself. Eat multiple, small meals rather than one or two large meals. Fatty foods can worsen steatorrhea, but it is still important to consume some fats because you need them to absorb certain vitamins. Just stick to healthy sources, such as nuts, seeds, olives, or fatty fish, rather than processed foods or red meat. And while fibre is good for gut health, many individuals with pancreatic exocrine insufficiency find low fibre intake makes digestion easier. You might also need certain vitamin or mineral supplements, and it\u2019s a good idea to discuss any nutrition concerns with a registered dietitian. The most effective treatment for pancreatic exocrine insufficiency is pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, which involves taking a medication called pancrelipase, sold under various brand names, which provide the body with enzymes. You take pancrelipase with each meal or snack that contains fat and/or protein. You will need to work with your health care team to establish dosage for pancrelipase, as this will vary from person-to-person and meal-to-meal, with large, fatty meals requiring more enzymes than small, low-fat meals. With pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy and some dietary adjustments, you can manage symptoms of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. However, you still need to work with your health care team to treat the underlying cause of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency as best you can.

        "video_sub_title": "hi everyone my name is dr. Tom Renault from the natural medicine clinic in Palm Beach Gardens Florida and this is my lovely wife Dawn hi everybody special guest with us today and today we're gonna talk about how to shrink thyroid nodules even if you're a sugar addict that's right so we had an experience with this earlier this year when don't and went dawn she wanted to share a little story with you and then and then I can add in how we were able to turn that around so some of you may know that six months ago in June yeah in June like my close friends I told this story to them on our patients also I woke up one morning and I was stretching and I was massaging my neck and I felt this huge module on my throat and it really freaked me out I've been under tremendous stress I lost my first doggie my my first baby and I've been going through some other family issues and just under a lot of stress not going to bed on time and just staying a blade and just burning the candle at both ends and I knew it was a recipe for a disaster so when that nodule popped up I was definitely concerned and had Tom take a look at it and feel it and he's like oh yeah you definitely need to get that taken you know looked at so um isn't I ordered an ultrasound and that came back with a finding of a nodule that was let's see the size was over two centimeters oh you have a picture of it to where you could actually see yeah yet how it was so big it was almost as if it came up overnight I I can't believe that I hadn't noticed it if it had been there for a little while because I'm very conscientious but um yeah yeah I'm not um the picture ever right here but the icon where I was able to share the screen disappeared somehow you can share it in comas after yeah yeah that's a good idea so um it was two point one centimeters by 1.3 mil 1.37 so 21 by 13 millimeters on in the right side that and that's this one that was shown there's another one on the left that was 1 centimeter by 1 centimeter there was a few other little ones down below - yeah in each one over there were 2 or 3 but that big one that thumb was seeing was the one that was over T centimeters and typically over 1 centimeter they'd like to do a needle biopsy so I sent I sent on referral to a local medical doctor and then what happened well I asked her if she would allow me to have some time before we did a needle biopsy because the thought of sticking a needle in my neck was definitely something I didn't want to do and I mean the whole time because there were a number of modules to the Neal order gone in multiple times in one area and in other areas you know and I know what we do here in our practice in our clinic and I see patients shrinking cysts and tumors and all kinds of things all the time so I knew exactly what I needed to do so I asked the doctor can I just do another ultrasound a couple weeks after I implements it a couple of things that my trusty husband and doctor was going to help me met so what'd you think she said this is crazy I've seen so many women these days with nodules and she actually made it very important you know she mentioned that it could be from phones and electronics and she just thinks something is going on that's so many women and actually meant you are getting these growths now not only did she you know palpate that nodule here that I needed see it yeah and you could see it but I also had a pretty large cyst in my breast that she felt - so I knew my body was screaming at me and so when you wanna yeah so they know so she she said okay instead of dawn came you know done came in and said an appointment and it's some lab work went over those findings and then the diet and one of the biggest things were dawn she was majorly addicted to sugar so this wasn't gonna be easy however just seeing what was happening to her body in I had a better reason now I I think I even did a Facebook live a couple years ago confessing that I was a sugar addict and that um you know it wasn't an easy thing but the fact that I had a reason now and I knew that I needed to completely cut out the sugar even though mind you it wasn't like corn syrup and refined sugar products it was coconut sugar and you know other foods that um had sugar in it so anyway I knew what I needed to do I don't think you believed I could do it but he really was suggesting that I do and the needle biopsy and I just had so much reason not to because I knew that diet and some other things that you suggested we truly helped so yeah so we um so when we got the lab work back - there were some I mean I thought fibroid actually was okay um it was more Thyra more adrenal stress adrenal fatigue adrenal stress dysfunction issues so we did some supplements awesome natural medicine or natural medicine form of the line of supplements for that and also measured iodine levels yes in Dawn's iodine levels it's actually a 24 hour urine iodine test and that showed um low levels of iodine which can be came and ultimately caused iron on Jules and cystic and cystic breast right so um and then the dye so the diet that um that dawn am I already on is they call it the free diet it's a proprietary dye that I came up with because it's free the most it's free of those foods that are most commonly responsible for inflammation fatigue digestive and other chronic health issues so the free diet on committed to dealing and so it's basically free of gluten grains sugar yeast dairy silly legumes GMOs I mean all those foods they're responsible inflammation and like you said chronic health and digestive issues it's a little different than paleo or the whole thirty that's pretty popular out there it has a couple of different tweet us and that I really make a difference it's a combination or a number are different diets including an elimination diet and on and on but anyway I'm there's matter of fact there's I'll put a link in here um for any of you listening if you like a copy complimentary of the free diet phase one it goes to a multiple thing you know three phases but phase one is where you get the most results typically four weeks and that's what don't committed to know I was having a lot of different symptoms that your patients come in with some some of your patients have like a list of 50 and I probably had maybe more I was just really burnt out I mean I was foggy bringing I couldn't think straight my memory I was my emotions are all over the place I don't know what other symptoms that I have well unable to really get going in the morning yes yes I wasn't motivated I wasn't I just look at my puppy self and I was really really struggling some food issues irritability yeah short short fuse all those symptoms of adrenal stress and fatigue like brain fog and omneya you know nervousness you know things like I would drop like I would just panic if something dropped behind me really loud and I would jump out on my skin it was like that firing adrenalin that was constant constant go so um oh and how many how many oh so anyway within two weeks within two weeks the I could not feel it anymore I couldn't see no diet I was sad because I didn't actually get the iodine in my system until the tests came back diet and initial supplements and then um when we got the INA results back went on a certain dosage of iodine and iodine is controversial because when you go online you'll see um you know half the half of the sources honey iodine is terrible you have any thyroid issues you should never take it and actually you should avoid it at all cost if the thyroid nodules are autoimmune I mean it's just rampant and endocrinologists are typically on the same page with that most all in your colleges will tell you to avoid it like the plague if you have thyroid issues however it is a considerable source and cause of nodules and goiter and should you take it well you should if you test low if you're deficient for it if you're not deficient if you're not low and you take iodine then that's that's really bad so yeah before you go taking high doses of iodine you should definitely test and make sure that you really need it I know by the years you've had so many women that have you know we're low in it and they had cystic breast and we're having to go and get ultrasounds and biopsies and many of them didn't even have to because when I went back the ultrasound shows that it was gone and when I went back to the radiologist boy they really gave me a hard time why I didn't want to do the mammogram why I didn't want to do that's a longer topic well I didn't want to do the needle biopsy and I said well you know can you just do the ultrasound and see what you see and they were completely surprised the doctor was like and what exactly did you do and so I told him because I've heard of iodine and how that can help but I don't know much about it and but the fact that he acknowledged that was I was really that was great yeah yeah so um we did the second ultrasound about seven seven and half weeks later that actually showed the nodule shrunk from over two centimeters to one centimeter so it shrunk by over fifty percent on the other side it shrunk um it was also my 50% all of those were under one senator and in the left side so yeah so they shrunk by over 50% and then that suspicious danger zone of over 1 centimeter what they like to do biopsies that was not an issue anymore because like is it a shrunk by over 50% and then um and they said I wanted to tell you um they said that I didn't really need to come back you know in a couple years if I wanted to check it again but because I know that that is not normal I'm still pressing forward and I know that if the body created it the body can heal it so I'm committed to completely eliminating that you know inflammation because I I know it's not supposed to be there so anyway we'll probably get I'll probably get retested again and then you need to check my iodine soon right right yeah so that's the thing with them really any of these chronic any of these chronic health conditions that that they say you need medication for in this case the typical treatment for thyroid nodules all it certain size they want to do surgery which is another concern yeah so my mom many years ago and she actually was diagnosed with thyroid cancer well it it was so they just classified it as that and so to be safe back of n this was probably 25 years when I we weren't married yet and they took out half of her her thyroid which you know now we know it's unnecessary but you know that was a concern I definitely even though I was in this field I thought to myself wow you know that's pretty big all of a sudden and you know your mind plays tricks on you but when you know the other side of the coin and the information and then you have that knowledge you know you you really can understand that even if it was cancer the body can when it's given the right environment we've seen it that happen with other people so right and um you just bait the body it doesn't incredible ability to heal itself so once you find out what's going on with the underlying root cause of the condition is and then adjust that to diet supplement lifestyle changes you know most anything you can you can heal and get better yeah definitely well and also um they did the ultrasound on my breasts as well and the the tech would not speak a word she's typing away I'm thinking oh lord please tell me that there's nothing there anymore and I knew in my heart I did everything I was supposed to do I knew it was gone but she wouldn't mom a word she didn't say anything to me she just held it there and was typing away and then the doctor came in and said oh so you didn't see anything there did you so that sis was completely gone too so it's amazing how our bodies can heal that's right so thanks for joining us today and again if you want um copies one of the free diet um just click below and you have any questions comments feel free to Silom do that below also and look forward to seeing you next time hold on one second before you go I just want to give it really a heartfelt thank you to my husband because that was a really stressful time in my life and so I'm super grateful that you're in my life and that I was able to heal that with the knowledge that you shared with me so thank you",

Symptoms of an anaphylactic reaction is typically a rash, swelling of the throat, difficulty swallowing, hives, low heart rate, low blood pressure even a feeling of fainting. As soon as you recognize symptoms of an anaphylactic reaction get your EpiPen and begin treatment as soon as possible. To use your EpiPen get your 2-pack. Open the lid and take out your EpiPen. Be sure to grasp it firmly on the barrel of the EpiPen. Don't put your hand over the top or over the bottom. Also remember blue to the sky orange to the thigh. Once you have a good grip on the barrel of your EpiPen remove the blue safety lid. Extend your arm and in one motion inject into your thigh. Hold for three seconds and count slowly. One...two...three. Pull your arm back to remove the needle. After using your first dose of epinephrine and you feel that your symptoms are resolving still go to the emergency room. You never know when or if that reaction might return again.",

        "video_title": "Hospital Acquired Infections & How To Prevent Them | Curos",
        "video_sub_title": "Have you, a loved one, or a friend gotten more sick by being in a hospital? We know it happens. One out of 25 hospitalized patients contract an infection from exposure to bugs in the facility. We call these nosocomial or healthcare-acquired infections. In the US, 1.7 million healthcare-associated infections are connected to about 100,000 deaths per year. So, what are the greatest infection risks in hospitals? Ironically, four of the most common types of hospital-acquired infections are caused by the devices and procedures employed to care for patients. Urinary tract infections contracted from catheters are the most common type of infection. Surgical site infections are the second most common and are generally caused by touch contamination. A lung infection known as ventilator-associated pneumonia with the use of a ventilator holds the highest mortality rate. And finally, bloodstream infections are a persistent danger. Those that stem specifically from vascular catheter use are especially deadly and the costliest of all hospital-acquired infections. So, what are hospitals doing to keep you safe? Well, even small precautions can have big effects. Handwashing, for example, is highly effective for reducing the risk of touch contamination from caregiver to patient. Likewise, a simple checklist of best practices used while inserting and maintaining venous access catheters has been shown to greatly reduce avoidable and costly bloodstream infections. The checklist includes steps like using a full sterile barrier including mask, cap and gown during insertion, ensuring that the access port is disinfected prior to each medication administration or blood draw by scrubbing or using disinfecting port protectors and being sure to remove any catheter as soon as it is no longer needed. Sadly, the success of hospitals in reducing infection rates differs significantly from one hospital to the next and even across units within the same hospital. At the heart of top performing hospitals is a strong executive commitment to a culture of safety and a focus on patient satisfaction. Do your homework. There are resources you can use to see how your local hospitals rank in their quality of care. But what about the infection risk for patients of outpatient surgery, home infusion, TPN and other conditions treated outside the hospital? More than 60 percent of surgical procedures occur in ambulatory centers that discharge patients to home based care on the same day. Approximately 40,000 people in the United States are receiving TPN at home and hundreds of thousands of dialysis, cancer and immuno-compromised patients leave the hospital with central lines in place. This means that more and more patients and their caregivers take responsibility for preventing infections while managing their own wound care, medication regimens, and catheter maintenance. If receiving care at home, ask your physician for detailed guidance on proper disinfection techniques and tools that work in the home. For example, a Curos disinfecting port protector can be easily used to disinfect IV connectors with alcohol and keep ports protected between uses for patient and caregiver peace of mind. The important thing to know is that infections that come from healthcare are preventable, not inevitable. There are organizations, health systems and individuals all across the U.S. making great improvements to honor their commitments to first do no harm. With concerted efforts by healthcare providers, payers and patients, we can achieve zero healthcare-acquired infections and that uneasy feeling of entering a hospital will be replaced with confidence in receiving quality care. Does your hospital follow safe disinfection practices? Be aware. Be safe.",

        "video_sub_title": "I bought this bonded fleece a few months ago to make some no so scarves I'd never seen bonded fleece before but I really like it it has two pieces of brother lightweight fleece so since I didn't get those done I've decided to make myself a skirt from one of my favorite skirts of all time I wear this all the time it's warm it's really simple and it is a French terry so it's easy fit easy so and it's warm in the winter time and in order to be able to make it a reversible skirt I'm going to come up I have come up with a rather neat seam process that I'll be showing you on camera when I get this cut out I'm going to allow an extra inch or so on top to make the waistband I'm going to put elastic rather than the tie I'm also going to allow an extra inch or so besides the seam to turn back and create an accent on both sides the black side the rectangle is cut out for my skirt have a pin at the top to indicate where the waistband is going to be and the NAP is running down on the fabric I prefer that rather than running up and that's just personal preference I will seam with the black side out pink sides are facing each other and when the seam is done this will be turned out and I will do a decorative stitch and that will be make a two-tone skirt I'm making side seams because I didn't want it pink stripe running up my back and looked like I had a like a skunk with a pink stripe running up my back I'll be leaving open slit for walkin purposes and this won't take very long to sew together and I think it's going to be a beautiful skirt I cut it with a rotary cutter to get a nice smooth cut because I want this really straight and I'm afraid a scissor would have been made a choppy cut now that I've got the skirt cut out I'm ready to so I have a new cameraman I have my grandson and it's going to help me out with on the camera so I'm excited to have him tell me this is going to be the waistband and it'll get turned back and elastic put in I am I have a large wide seam allowance but this is because I'm going to be turning this back so that I can have a reversible skirt so right now just going to stitch straight down I even have a new pink sweater that's going to match the pink of this on the way in I've never had any help with camera before and so this is going to be really good to have Ian helping me out here I'm going to leave a portion not sewn for a side slip so that I can walk around a little bit and I don't have that mark yet because we're gonna have to mark as far as the length after I get the waistband sewn on so now I'm going to stop here and go back to the top of the skirt and so that seemed okay Ian and I are ready to start from the top again and so from the top down it's still snowing outside you yeah part of that was earlier wonder how much we're supposed to get do you know what time do you play basketball tomorrow 11 or 12 what'd you just steal I just cut the thread no to make it slower I pushed the Fix button hmm and that set the stitch this is ready for the waistband to be turned under to cut away some of the bulk cuz we don't need extra bulk around the waistband right right how would you know your skinny thing Paul saw you make stuff before so I'm gonna cut away so I can turn this down see how far I'm going to turn it down this is about an inch you can see how scientific this is I have actually never made a reversible skirt like this before but I've never worked with this bonded fleece before but you're going to get the idea here this does not Ravel so it does not need to be turned under the stitch will the band will be sewn with just a straight stitch around an elastic put inside but now with this wide seam allowance this is where I'm going to trim this up and make sure this is perfectly straight and stitch both sides down and that will be a pink trim on both sides on my black skirt so as soon as I get that then then again we'll turn the camera back on and show you that so the waistband is almost done and you may ask why I'm using safety pins because my sewing room is still not put together since we moved I cannot find anything so I'm back to square one I'm sewing in my bedroom on a table this is how I started I only I started on the kitchen table so I'm just kind of sort of making do aren't we in yes like I showed you before this is not even turned under actually this will never even be seen because I always wear sweaters out over waistband and I'm gonna stop there because I'm gonna slip the lastik through they're fixing the seam but next Sunday you're going to have your arm fixed right yes I hope so well leaf by next month next end again okay all of the seam allowances are turned back and a decorative stitch put down both sides and these are the slit to be on each side of the skirt and on the corners I have them flipped back into a diagonal fold back and this is the last of the hem to do you so here's this and then this is the flip side and have that nice decorative arching stitches on there that will be on the other side barely visible on the black side but that's okay the pink stripe is very visible so now all I have to do is put elastic in the waistband and skirt rated wear so let's finish up scarf to match",

        "video_title": "Black Scout Tutorials - How to Start/Build a Fire",
        "video_sub_title": "what's up guys black Scout survival and today we're going to be talking about how to start a fire and basically we're going to go over the basics of fire making and kind of like some tips and tricks that I use when starting a fire and when you're starting a fire you need three things that's oxygen heat and fuel okay your fuel is going to natural materials that you find the heat will be a you know lighter match ferrocerium rod whatever you can find in oxygen obviously you know and and like a primitive fire oxygen is going to be crucial as far as blowing that Umbra into a flame but you know using a spark based fire like we're going to do you're not going to need to do that whenever you get put in a survival situation and you know you're moving about the first thing you want to be doing is looking for dry material tender material if you don't have any man-made on you so you're going to be trying to find that and I carried on you because if it is wet you can dry it out while you're you know going to your set up your camp or trying to affect the self-rescue so you'll put in your pockets and dry it out now in most situations whenever I go camping or in the field or whatever I don't use man-made fire starters I use whatever I find in the field and base ashes practice and you know I feel like you know that's what you need to do man-made fire starting stuff is you know like you know petroleum jelly covered cotton balls and you know tinder quick tabs and all that kind of stuff and that's the last ditch fire Sarma tour for me if it's real wet and I can't find something dry you know and I need this to start a fire that's what I use it for but most time like I said I use what I find out there the other three components you need is tinder kindling smaller stuff and fuel okay guys so the you know tinder needs to be dry combustible material right here I have some inner bark from a tulip poplar tree and I'm going to make this into a bird's nest in a few minutes then you have you know especially in the south we have fat wood great you know material that you can find pretty readily in the south as I said your kindling needs to vary from you know pencil led or matchstick sized dry sticks and you need to you know get to hear that pop from it and then beyond that your next line of kindling should be you know pinky size or pencil size then after that your fuel should be wrist up to forearm size and that's just an easy way to remember it and you need all this stuff to be dry but like you know right here I got some inner bark of a tulip poplar tree and basically you're just going to strip this stuff up and whatever you're creating you know any you know getting your materials to start a fire first off you want to make sure that you get everything in place going to get all your fuel all your tender and everything gathered up prior to actually starting that fire because if you don't you're going to be trying to run around and trying to get that fire started whenever you could just have it all there and it could go out on you and then you have to start the whole process over again and you don't want to do that so base I'm just going to strip this up another good key it's like let's say you're in an Arctic environment you're you know about to get hypothermic hypothermic or hypothermic I'm sorry hypothermia you're going to need to get ten times like once you gather your material you need to get ten times the amount of material that you think you'll need that way you don't run out so basically we're just going to fluff this stuff up like I said you need dry combustible material so you want to strip this stuff up real good and make a good bird nest now we have our bird nests made and what I like to use is a brace you know a lot of people use teepee styles or log cabin styles I just like to use a brace I find it the most effective and I'll kind of go over why in just a second but you want go ahead and set your bird nest up against the brace one it will help block win you know protect your bird nest with this fat wood out the way and see it takes a light quite quickly so then we're just going to throw our pencil size kindling up here let it take a flame and the good thing about the braces that you can kind of lift it up to give it fuel or I'm sorry oxygen to light all that stuff once you got that you just want to go to your next kindling and while your brace is you know heating up it'll light as well and you can just pick that up just to add more oxygen and you can see you know that was quick gather all my stuff up instead of waiting and just grabbing one thing at a time I gather it all up and draw a combustible material oxygen my kindling you know matchstick pencil led sighs on to pinkie sighs and then you know we can start adding you know fuel and the other good thing about the brakes you can kind of add stuff to the outside and what that will do is is allow you to heat up any wood and draw it in wood that may be wet you can kind of like set stuff to the side there and just let let it heat up and it'll light up the other thing is I forgot to mention you wanna make sure you clear out your area so you're not starting forest fire you know I've already did that prior to starting the video but you can see fire very quick preparation oxygen fuel and heat and you know you can use a pharisee and rough spark bass like I did or you can use them match or flame based but that's how to start a fire guys real quick and easy you know using natural materials whenever you can you know I know it's easy for us to use cotton balls and and all these other types of tinder out there but use the stuff you can find out in the wilderness it'll prepare it better prepare you for a true survival

know here's the neck the first seven bones if that's that's forward like this I know if you can see this bump here it's really bring it in the bump is really going to stick out and that's what you're seeing with neck huh there's always that one pump that that's prominent okay and I wouldn't even get more prominent with this problem right so by the way let's take care of your business by the way if

Brad have a Syria does it need disease spread about we like to be like that's what it's really like to be like but also today you have need to go over Facebook cuz we aren't giving away do we have it now okay fine I'll go get it we're giving away a wax well paraffin bath this thing's beautiful we did a whole video on it you don't have to want to miss out on this in just couple days what brand almost ripped with that alright so that's it yeah oh this is show on Facebook two-minute the faces I won't hurt season like season we got it so it's fine before midnight tonight it's full of paraffin and it'll warm up your hand give moisture to it we did a whole video on you're gonna like it so all right what am I going to get started here let's let's start off the first thing you're gonna do is we've got to start correcting I'm going to show you some exercise you can do throughout the day and then I'll show you some exercises you maybe do once a day so the first three exercises are ones you can do as you're watching right now and even throughout today the first one you're probably sick of us doing this one is chin tucks right so because you know you just simply the big problem is the head forward so you're gonna work on tucking your chin in and bring in your neck back you're not dipping down like this you're not dipping up like this you're just going straight back and you'll notice everything down here straightens up as well along with it so it's not just doing the neck but it's getting the upper back as well grab once you bring the 2x4 on up this little vial inside the hot pot stir fry okay so here we got the rounded here the head forward chest is depressed and aligned so now I'm going to the chin tuck I'm tucking my chin in and I'm bringing my I'm backing up my my ears and you can see I'm correcting I'm getting back straining okay I'm thinking if we tape this 2x4 to you you walk girl like that for a day you won't have yeah I would be a teacher like that all right next one grab very simple one to do just go bring your hands forward and then you'll bring your hand and squeeze your shoulder blades together right so this is not working on that thing you know where you tend to be rounded out the back by bringing this back just see how I straighten everything out and I'm strengthening the muscles that are going to help me stay in that right position right so we did the chin tuck we do these and now we can do it hit the road jack well you go back like this thumbs up and go like this I like that Bob yeah some elbows back thumbs up hit the road jack and you get that external rotation that's good for those muscles as well so we're getting two for the price of one it's a great great exercise combination now these first three are once like I said you can do throughout the day now you know maybe people will look at you a little bit strange but you know we're used to that you aren't but we are yeah you will get used to it all right next one Brad now we're going to go ahead and do some exercise that you can do on your own probably at home probably on the floor be the best carpeted floor yeah so we're going to start off with can you take a roll sheet or towel I mean you can certainly make it bigger than this to you could take even two towels like it I can see have white I'm white here so yeah if you got enough here there you go yeah this shows that we've done oh yeah this one is not that thick I probably would have it even thicker you're gonna pull something else I would have that but that would be too thick but it could work for something I think I like the tape idea though Brad if you're going to use it all the time but we try to save all of you money all the time so it where the scope let me show on the on you Brad where we're going to put this usually like right below the shoulder blades or right the mid thoracic area mid-back and it's going to help correct that rounding out by making it go the opposite direction and this is nice because gravity does the work you relax and let gravity open that chest up and it's you know typically quite comfortable and you can feel it open up that chest and yeah I'll get the shoulders back where you want things are already starting to stretch so now I can and this is a good time to work on your breathing we've done some videos on that already to it but now you just move it bring your arms up pulse and just let them relax to the side while you're taking breathing in through the nose out through the mouth up and out now Bob I do want to bring up a point there are going to be people who already have contracted necks and they're not going to be able to get go ahead now it's going to be painful now get your head down so you're gonna have to put something probably too much that that would be too much alright just another little telegram yeah yeah if you can't get your head down or your like this or you know you're gonna want to have just a slight towel and over time hopefully you'll be able to work your way down great so you don't need that extra support and then you know your posture is going to be so dry down now you know after doing ten of those I'm going to go into the Y position why Brad why why exactly why okay and then finally you're going to finish up with the Superman or superwoman well of course yeah right they got a good movie out now wow I'm surprised you know that you don't use you know pop culture Brad I know well I heard about it well and they didn't tell you where he was I heard okay all right next one Brad where are we at let's see oh now we're gonna go ahead and do some standing ones Brad let's let's uh go ahead and stand or sit you can do this one all right you're gonna let's let Stan I'll show from this direction okay gonna link your hip your thumbs together you're gonna pull the and you're pulling them apart while you're doing it in this endeavor so not really hard but we're trying to activate some of these muscles back here I make sense we bring it up like this and then you're going to lower it down so I linked the thumbs up magically incorporate some breathing in with this and then lower it down palms are going up relax yep breathing with this is exactly right Brendan breathe then as they go up exhale as you go down how many times bop Oh again we can do you can do 20 of these if right I would probably do five to ten myself because I'm not a patient person but a little bit of something better a lot of nothing all right well let me take the strap Brad subscribe and you want you got something you can use to alright you can use this is the stretch on strap you could use a dog leash you could use a long belt or a towel or air like that you don't need to go on buy something for this but you're just going to go ahead and get again you're gonna go I'm gonna sit because I can see the camera here is not going to pick me up right so you bring it up over here like this and then you can lower it down like this now if you can't make it if I go this part I can't go back see there so you may have to go wider then and then you can bring it back and this just really opens up the chest Brad and I think that's a benefit of using if you've got an elastic band or tubing the tubing I get up to here and I can't do but the tubing compensates for it and allows me to write the right and you don't you get a little bit strengthing yeah but you know you could tubing or bad yep actually do some of this in there now you can also stretch it a little bit going the other way going this way and stretching up this way it's just stretching some different fibers of them the chest muscle but well I'm really starting to feel relaxed Brad doing this I mean yeah it really is starting to open up everything you know my next back chibs back you know I'm starting to get everything really moving quite well by the way Brad we didn't mention normally how we do this we try to get through all the stretches and then we try to take some questions at the end can I keep moving on here alright now we're going to lay on the bed we're gonna remove the towel and Brad's gonna show what I'm doing sarcoid this plant like this product and we're gonna go ahead and keeping here this is going to keep contact with the arms the hand and the elbow on the bed or on the floor and you're going to move up one at a time can you be seen I'm out of there about so I'm doing the same thing except for amusing the walls yeah the post this can be difficult to do some people and I have trouble on this side this is how far I get and I'm starting to creep up so this shows me that I have more difficulty on one side than the other my left side straighter to it yeah this is a family show you're all right all right and the next one you can do is you do a little bit isometric strength and you got the elbows at a right angle here you just push into the bed so you're going to step down now you could do this one two three four five six seven eight nine ten you can even go lower one two three four five six seven eight nine ten the old joke would be one two or three gold alarm one two or three four five six seven okay then you go up higher all right if you want to show it I'll show you some of the traditional ones Bonnie you want to throw me a couple pillows Rome pyres I think we just woke Lonnie up she looked like she was in a daze yeah so you put a couple of pillows underneath yo and we're gonna go Y cross reverse wide so if you're looking down at Baba's here yeah I'm going palms down these aren't good workout you're gonna have to talk about people probably can't hear me Wow okay I'm trying to show my show from your show yeah can you hear me out there people and then we're going down but yeah we're working these muscles the upper upper middle and lower traps as well as there's other muscles too that all postural muscles to get those shoulders back to get you looking like a fly another antique breathe well your shoulders are going to work well mechanically everything works better with good posture now eventually you can actually take cans sure and do those with cans if you want to really is going to work and if you happen to have one dumbbell weights you could do that too but we don't like to get too fancy but won't you look and see if anybody's going to question you and with fullest exercise that last one you can also you do it palms down but you can also do a thumbs up when you're doing that one so did you have a question he looks like you have a question well what about how we can sleep if you can if you can't on your back how can you sleep if you can't sleep on your back yeah is that the question we have a couple of videos on this I'm going to show you just one thing one hint for sleeping like on your side because one thing we don't like you sleeping on you're on the point of your shoulder I need one more pillow a lot I suppose oh we do all right okay when you sleep on you is on your side this is just a little hint you're gonna have the double pillow here because you don't want your head to go this way or this way you want to right in the middle so if I only had one pillow I would go like this and so we use double pillows when you're on your side but then you put you leave you leave a little gap here for your shoulder now you can do this with a throw pillow or just a regular pillow and you put your shoulder right in there and now there's no stress on the shoulder or very little the neck is lined up the way it is you can put another pillow between your legs if you want for your back I know it's it's like pillow crazy but it works out really well and I believe it out that's how I sleep Brad I got a throw pillow right here and I sleep on my side that way I just did last night no I think you don't believe me I don't care and you didn't really care alright that was a way that sleep correctly by the way how many repetitions all right the one like the chin tops and this one and hit the road jack you can do those you know every hour a couple of them sure the other ones I would go once a day I would do good you can do it you said five to ten maybe to start off with there but you can work your way these are posture muscles you do high reps you can do 20 reps if you want to work up to that a moment good question by the way we don't know what are we like about our the people that subscribe to us and then like us they're very smart did you notice that Brad I know we are higher intelligence than normal exactly well our our viewing audience is up above average there's no doubt about it lion-o's exercise is good for car Falls carpal tunnel are they good for comfort on yes they are let me explain to you why a lot of times with carpal tunnel there's a thing called a double crunch syndrome so you got the nerves coming out of your neck and they come down they travel into the arm and into the wrist and into the Hat sometimes they're getting pinched up in here Brad right with bad posture it's getting pinched here so it's already the nervous sensitive and by the time it gets down to the carpal tunnel area and got that band going across there it's it's already sensitive so now it's doubly sensitive it's already compromised so I'm a meter by limiting so when we stretch all this out we're leaving more room for the nerves to have to travel and there's less pressure this is one of the first things we do when we treat carpal tunnel is we make sure they rolling her eyes so any more questions on facebook laughing might ohh laughing my butt off is what they're saying so I I think when we're maybe wrapping it up red or anything quick right here oh god yeah we got someone from Kennesaw was asked about knee pain but we're not going to get into knee pain we'd love to do it but we'll have well I got lots of videos on knee pain just you know there is their little search thing on our site you know just take a look on that because we've got a lot of videos on you have just put a knee pain fat and our videos for that specifically but right now we don't have the time for that how we do about we got I think we're good yeah we got patience like for Zoey Moses : okay focus Lonnie this is a question kyphosis this is good for kyphosis right you know again you're gonna do what your body allows you to do but this is wonderful for kyphosis and you really want to avoid doing flexion activities as expenses sometimes kyphosis is caused by a compression fracture for those who don't know okay also says it means the big bad found it out like tennis from here to here this section of the back is rounded for that's not as kyprolis every step that little that's thoracic kyphosis I'm assuming a little squeeze thing go remember presenting a vertebrae and we could squeeze it down to show how the compression fracture looks like no okay nevermind alright for watching and please catch us again next week take care",

        "video_sub_title": "hi it's sandy here with another video that could save someone's life and on this video I'm going to show you how to perform CPR on an adult we have to perform CPR when someone has a cardiac arrest and there are around 250 arrests every day in the UK so be prepared before we get stuck in we need to assess a situation by using the mnemonic doctor a b c or d are a b c firstly D stands for danger where you're checking if it's safe for you and the victim we check danger every day of our lives but in a situation like this your Adrenaline's pumpin and you tend to forget our stance or a response can we get a response from them by shouting at them and pinching their air if they're unresponsive then they're unconscious so shout for help a stands for airway and you need to open it and get that tongue out of the way do this by placing your hands on the forehead moving the head back and opening their mouth with your fingertips lifting the chin B stands for breathing which you need to check that they are doing get your ear near enough to their mouth to listen watch their chest to see if it rises and see if you can feel breath on your cheek check breathing for ten seconds if they are not breathing normally or at all then you have to start CPR and when I say not breathing normally in 40% of cardiac arrest cases in the first few minutes of arrest some victims have what's called agonal gasps this looks like they're moving their mouths and gasping for air that's not normal breathing and it shouldn't be confused with normal breathing and CPR should commence straightaway also of course make sure an ambulance is coming and also shout for a defibrillator in a public place C stands for a CPR so let's crack on place the heel of your hand in the center of our chest and interlock your other hands on top lock your arms and get yourself in a position so that your nose is pointing straight down at your hands press down on the chest around five to six centimeters and release the pressure still keeping your hands on the chest do this thirty times a speed of 120 beats per minute or the Bee Gees classic stayin alive once you've done this through a chest compressions open up the airway again as before and this time pinch the nose make a good seal between your life and theirs and blow steadily to make the chest rise that you can see making sure not to blow too hard do this again once you've given two rescue breaths repeat the whole procedure of 30 chest compressions and then two rescue breaths repeat this 32 to on and on and there's only three occasions that you stopped firstly when the ambulance crew arrives and they take over secondly you become exhausted and thirdly they show signs of regaining consciousness such as coughing or moving or breathing normally so that's adult CPR I really hope that's taught you something and hopefully you'll remember it if needed but of course you can't be learning it for real and practicing on dummies so why don't you book a course with me and I'll teach you loads more life-saving skills good bye for now God buddy finish don't get it you",

        "video_sub_title": "heythe Caroline today I want to take you through an easy lower back health massage video all you'll need are two yoga tune-up balls or tennis balls and eight malach if you don't have a block at home you can use a big book potentially something that's just about this height and width so get creative when you're ready to get started you'll need both balls and you're gonna place the balls against your lower back and come to your forearms so open your chest and let the balls compress the muscle get your lower back take a nice deep breath and let it out good from there I just want you to lift your hips slightly and chug the balls down the lower spine and back up so we're just easier way into the lower back and this Do It Yourself massage technique can be really helpful if you suffer suffer from lower back pain hip pain or just run around a lot you have a stressful busy full life taking that little bit of time to do this well ease your stress and sore tired muscles good from there I want you to take the ball back to the lower spine and low lower all the way down on the map so from here I just want you to let the balls push up against your lower back and you can adjust them or move them as needed to fit your body okay so now I'd like you to sway the hips side to side letting the balls compress against the lower back remember to take nice deep breaths move the ball slightly up and continue with that motion rocking the hips side to side relax your face take an inhale and an exhale from here all you'll do is remove one of the balls and let the other ball fall on the lower back on one side take your knees and let the knees fall to the side that the ball is on you can leave one knee up toward the ceiling then from here you're just going to chug your body down and up letting the ball roll up and down on the lower dock intense especially intense if you are very active or you spend a lot of time at a computer or both so let the ball compress against an area that you feel needs a little bit of extra love let your palms face up close your eyes and take a deep breath inhale and exhale good open your eyes slowly return both of the feet back to Center remove the ball from that side and take it to the other side so you find a nice spot on your lower back that feel like it needs a little bit of attention and massage and let the knees fall over to that side from here again you'll chuck the upper body or bath or the body up and down letting the ball massage the lower back gently now if you're working with you with tuna balls they have a perfect density tennis balls can be a little soft so I highly recommend purchasing the yoga to nut balls if you have not done so already there are about $11 on yoga to not calm hold the lower back lower ball against the lower back let your body rest against than that and take a deep breath and exhale it up good return the feet to center remove the ball and find your block so this next technique that we're doing is really intense so if it's too much return to the technique that we just did without the block so what you'll do you only need one ball you'll lift the hips and take the block until it rests underneath your sacrum or lowered back to you the ball you're going to let the ball rest against the lower back in between the block and the dock so you can kind of see I sandwich the ball between the block and my sign from here I'm going to find the spot that needs some love and let my knees fall over to that side the extra height of the block really adds a deeper pressure and some intensity to this massage technique so all you're gonna do is hold or you can gently sway side to side breathing thinking positive relaxing bring it back to center with this ball against the block I want you to guide the knee in towards your chest and that should add even more pressure to that sticky spot on your lower back with the knee in towards your chest inhale deeply exhale completely let the foot come back to the floor lift the hips and remove the ball from that side of the lower back let's do the other side so take the ball against the lower back let the ball sandwich between the block and back then with the knees fall to the side with the ball resting against the lower spine closed eyes take a deep breath and let it out and again you can go side to side gently if that feels nice to you or just hold and let the ball play pressure against the muffle come back to Center gently guide the knee in towards the chest good with the knee in towards the chest breathe in deep exhale about it now slowly from here let the foot come back to the floor remove the ball remove the block and rest the back on the mat so now laying down on the floor you can notice the length that you've gained from your lower back the real relaxation you've gained not only in your muscles but in your mind as well bring your both knees in towards your chest give yourself a nice big hug thanks again for joining me for this quick lower back massage video I hope your muscles feel amazing check out caroline jordan fitness calm for more health and happiness tips and I can't wait to see you again soon

        "video_sub_title": "A walking stick is designed to aid your stability when walking, but it's not designed to be lent on. There are a variety of handles and feet designs to suit the needs of different users. In this short tutorial, we'll show you how to use this piece of equipment. Firstly, the walking stick needs to be at the correct height. Stand with your arm by your side, and then bend your elbow to a 45 degree angle. Measure from the wrist to the floor. Take this measurement as the height of the handgrip. Follow the supplier's instructions for adjusting and maintaining. Once the height is set, walk normally with the stick at you side. Check your stick regularly, especially for wear on the rubber foot - known as the ferrule - and replace this as necessary. If available, always check any instructions provided by your supplier and always seek assistance if you have any difficulty.",

        "video_sub_title": "you might be looking for some tips to help improve your exercise program and things you can eat in your diet to avoid that lactic acid buildup i'm charlotte lawson a registered and licensed dietitian here in tampa bay florida now lactic acid happens when our body has exerted all of its energy and stored energy in the form of glycogen and is looking for an alternative process and typically lactic acid only happens when we're doing our anaerobic exercise anaerobic meaning the body is metabolizing and accessing our energy when there's no oxygen present so anaerobic exercises are your short sprints or your weight lifting any sort of flight or fight and flight type energy exertion very quick versus our aerobic exercises where you're having a longer slower metabolism and utilization of energy now there aren't really any particular foods to eat that can avoid that lactic acid buildup but my best suggestion would just be to make sure you have enough glycogen stores now it's probably going to be really you know it's hard to say until you can avoid it all together but by containing enough glycogen stores your body might not have to turn to that alternative form of energy this is kind of like your carb loading for instance the night before a big event or a basketball game or a race now don't go overboard with the carbs because again lactic acid buildup is almost kind of you can't you can't prevent it i guess essentially because it really does depend on the type of exercise you do also keep in mind as your body starts getting used to the type of exercises you're doing you're less likely to have that muscle tearing and that lactic acid buildup so hopefully those are a couple tips really it tends to be with your exercise program so maybe you want to switch it up a little bit and add some more aerobic exercise i'm charlotte and eat happy",

        "video_sub_title": "here's another handy thing that you can do at home to help with like minor aches and pains it involves the turmeric and it's very good for like joint pain it's good for a lot of different things as I mentioned we go through I'm going to use you can use different liquids what I'll use is DMSO and I'll use just a little bit of water to dilute the DMSO but what we're going to do is make a paste and and I'll show you how it's done here it's very easy I've got a little bit of DMSO when you buy DMSO I always recommend getting a 99.5 99.9 percent DMS so I've got roughly a teaspoon of DMSO in here now and then I'm going to put like a third a teaspoon which I'm not going to measure it's just it's fairly close third teaspoon of water and it gets a little DMSO like an oil so you'll see it kind of swirl around and DMSO will also heat up that's normal when you mix the water with it so if that happens that's normal that's why the little come back down and so I've got that in the jar and then what I would do since I've got a roughly a teaspoon what a romantic would you do you double the amount of turmeric and so I'm going to use like two teaspoons and it may take a little more but it's not again it's not critical just until you get a good paste and when you're using this as a paste keep in mind that it it will stain your skin and so it's kind of messy I'm gonna need just a little bit more and I can add a little water but you can its the paste it'll it'll pigment the skin and the issue with that is it doesn't just wash off I mean it actually goes into the skin especially when you're using the DMS so like this and when that happens it's going to have to wear off so I mean once I put this on our elbow it may be a week before you know all the coloring comes out but it works real well the other thing you can use it for is on warts and I like to use it a lot when you I'm going to do a larger area because she's got an elbow problem but what we'll do is use this paste and you can see it's it's thick and it's about the right consistency it's almost like mustard that's about what you're looking for is the paste and then I'm just going to take a little bit I'm trying to get on my hands cuz I don't want it all over me but I don't mind it being on her and she said that that's about where her pain was when we talked about it earlier I'm gonna put just a little bit more and again we could have used like I said bandage but when you're putting it on thicker like this it's almost good to do the paste and then to keep the heat in it's thick enough it's going to stay I just take a little bit of plastic wrap and we're going to wrap that out that'll keep it off her clothes it'll also keep keep the heat in there and it'll keep it exactly where we want it I want to bend your elbow this little bit this way I just put one to hold it on there and I'm gonna we're gonna wrap it a couple times not tight or anything just enough that it will stay on see that not the neatest job in the world but if this was something you were going to do at home then you would just go sit and you sit in front of TV yoga resting from the bed and that would hold that in there and it would not be messy but it'll hold that heat on it'll stick and then what I would recommend is well if it's if it's a hurting pain we'll take a heating pad and she can just wrap that heating pad on plug it on plug it in and he's had that heating pad on and help drive that bin there but it works real well they use it a lot all over the world like I say you can use C if you don't have DMSO you can use coconut oil you can use lime juice or you can use water it all works effectively that way as well you",

        "video_sub_title": "diabetes is a condition that develops because of elevated levels of glucose or blood sugar in the bloodstream many people with diabetes take insulin every day to help keep their blood sugar at a normal healthy level there are many ways to take insulin such as with a syringe pen or pump this video will review how to draw up and give an injection of insulin using a syringe there are many types of insulin many people take two types of insulin one is long-acting the other is rapid acting your doctor will tell you what kind of insulin to take how much to take and when to take it most people with diabetes take insulin with meals and at bedtime insulin will spoil if it gets too hot or too cold you need to store it properly in order for it to keep working keep insulin at a temperature between 36 degrees Fahrenheit to 86 degrees Fahrenheit in most cases that means you can leave open bottles at room temperature most insulin lasts 28 days after opening put a date on the bottle to remind you when to throw it away keep unopened bottles in the refrigerator and the insulin will stay good through the expiration date on the label learning to draw up insulin from the bottle takes practice your nurse at a diabetes educator will help you learn to draw up insulin use a clean flat surface to place your insulin syringe and other supplies wash your hands with soap and water check the label to make sure the insulin has not spoiled expired or been open longer than 28 days wipe the top of the insulin bottle with alcohol swab remove the cap from the needle pull back the syringes plunger to the number of units of insulin you'll be taking this will pull air into the syringe push the needle through the rubber top of the insulin bottle while it is on the flat surface push the plunger all the way down to push the air in the syringe into the bottle this makes it easier to draw out the insulin keep the needle in the bottle and turn the bottle upside down draw up the dose of insulin you need you may see air bubbles in the syringe to remove air bubbles push all the insulin back into the bottle and draw up the dose again you can also tap the top of the syringe to make the bubbles rise to the top push the bubbles back into the bottle if needed pull back on the plunger again until you have the correct amount of insulin in the syringe having bubbles in the syringe will not harm you however bubbles take the place of insulin so you will not be getting the full amount you need once the bubbles are removed take the needle out of the bottle when you have the correct dose of insulin once you have the right amount of insulin in the syringe have another person check that you drew up the right dosage give the shot in a place where you have at least half an inch of fat under the skin the best areas are the stomach buttocks outer thigh and back of the upper arm be sure to rotate to different areas each time you inject if you do not you can cause injury and scarring to the tissue and the insulin may not be absorbed inject insulin at least 2 inches away from the belly button do not give shots near moles or scars choose two different places for each shot when taking two shots at one time once you have chosen an injection site clean your skin with an alcohol swab and let it dry before giving the shot pick up the syringe like you would hold a pencil and take off the needle cap using your other hand gently pinch the cleaned area into a three inch fold do not squeeze the skin hard or you might squeeze out the insulin insert the needle into your skin at a ninety degree angle if you are using a short needle insert the needle into your skin at a forty-five degree angle if you are using a long needle this makes sure you are injecting the insulin into fat instead of muscle push the plunger down until all of the insulin is gone from the syringe wait 10 seconds then pull out the needle do not take more insulin if any of it leaks out just make a note in your insulin and blood sugar log do not rub the injection site this can cause the insulin to be absorbed too fast for safety be sure to throw away the syringe after one use put it into a container that is either a medical sharps container or one made of extra thick plastic like one that holds liquid laundry soap never reuse or share used syringes with another person injecting

Wesley's chairside assistants and today i'm going to show you how to fit how to floss your fixed retainer I have fixed retainers on my upper and lower arch put there by dr. Wesley so I make the perfect candidate to show you how to do this to floss what you will need is a floss cutter and any type of floss you like to use at home you want to take your floss better take the floss thread it through the loop pull your small end through I usually like to hold my small end in my pinky or my fingers so I don't lose it the next thing you're going to have to do I'm going to explain it and then show you is you're going to take your floss starter find the V point in your gum and kind of wiggle the threader through until will feed all the way through to the other edge alright once you've got your floss threaded through both sides of your retainer you want to take the floss and do a C curve to each side making sure to wash each tooth efficiently then as you saw you want to delicately hold your finger in place and slide the floss out to make sure you're not pulling up against the retainer which can damage it once you're done with that one you usually have with our bure fixed retainers their canine to canine so you want to go inside your canine teeth all the way across the other inside of your canine tooth now as you saw the angulation on the lower is kind of on an upward direction for the upper retainer it is a little bit different so I'm also going to floss my upper retainer for you same thing just take floss wetter but your floss straight through hold that in and then again I'm going to do the same thing without explaining it to you but just showing you how to do it on the top all right again top one you have to do k9 all the way over to other k9 where your fixed retainers placed and now if it is in a different place sometimes we only do it for the front four teeth because fixed retainers can take a lot of bite force on the canines biggest thing um try to flosses at least four times a week it's going to keep it healthy it's going to keep it clean it's going to ensure that when you go in for your regular six-month cleanings that the hygienist isn't telling you this is a bad retainer choice for you dr.

        "video_title": "10 Best Rotator Cuff Pain Stretches - Ask Doctor Jo",
        "video_sub_title": "hey everybody it's doctor Jo and Bear, and today we're going to show you the top ten stretches for the rotator cuff. so let's get started. so these top ten stretches are my favorite top ten. there's no research behind it it's just what I found has worked best for me and for my patients. so by the term rotator cuff, that usually means four main muscles. so supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor and subscapularis, but when you really think about the rotator cuff, the rotator cuff has a lot to do with the scapula and the shoulder blade, and there's like 20 muscles that attach to the scapula, so when we're doing stretches, we're not just stretching those rotator cuff muscles, we're stretching all the muscles around that scapula and shoulder blade because if one of those are out of balance, it's going to make everything else out of balance and cause a lot of problems with the rotator cuff. and just a reminder for the stretches when you're doing a stretch, you want to hold it for at least 30 seconds and do it three times, so that really lets those muscle fibers go, help stretch them out that Golgi tendon organ, or the GTO, you really need that 30-second hold for it to relax and let go, so 30 seconds three times. so the first stretch that we're gonna do is pendulums. pendulums are one of my favorites for the shoulder. what it does is it really just helps open up that joint, loosen up those muscles, really kind of get them warmed up for you to stretch. so let's take a look at that. for shoulder pendulums, you're just gonna dangle your arm down towards the floor, you're not actively gonna move your arm, but you're going to use your body to move your arm making circles and then reverse it the other way. for shoulder arm swings front to back, just let your arm dangle down, you're not actually moving the arm but you're moving your body to make your arm move. for shoulder arm swings from side to side, just dangle your arm down. keep it nice and relaxed, you're not actually moving your arm but you're moving your body side to side. the next stretch is just going to be a scaption stretch, so scaption is basically not flexion out in front of you, not abduction out to the side, but it's kind of right in the middle, and just doing some scaption stretches going straight up and down is a really great way just to kind of again stretch out that shoulder, but not holding the stretch just kind of getting those muscles warmed up and moving, so let's check those out. for shoulder scaption active range of motion, put your thumb in an upward position and keep your arms straight, it's not completely out to the front and it's not out to the side, it's about in the middle at a 45 degree angle, and just bring it up to about 90 degrees. number three. so stretching with a stick or a PVC pipe, you can use you a cane if you have a cane, is a great way to really get that extra stretch especially maybe you're not able to quite get that movement yet, so we're going to do a flexion stretch with a stick, so let's check that out. for shoulder flexion passive range of motion with a stick, you can use a cane, or a broomstick, or PVC pipe if you have some. your arm is just going to go along for the ride, so the other arm is going to do all the movement it's just going up and down, and then the other ones just sitting on top. number four, now we're going to go into an abduction stretch with a stick, so again I really like using the stick it kind of helps get into that stretch if you're still in a passive stage, or an active assistive stage where you can't really move it on your own yet, like you're not supposed to because of a precaution or just because you can't because it still hurts a lot. using the stick really helps move that shoulder and that arm for you without you having to actively doing it. so let's check out. for abduction for shoulder abduction passive range of motion with the stick, you can use a cane, a broomstick, or PVC pipe if you have some. your arm is just going to go along for the ride and the other one's doing all the movement. so it's pushing the arm up, just set your hand on top of the cane or the PVC pipe with your thumb pointed upwards, and then just push your arm up as comfortably as you can. number five is going to be external rotation stretch with the stick. so the same concept you're using that stick to push through that motion to really get that stretch and a lot of times again it's too painful to do or maybe you're not supposed to actively use those muscles yet if you've had a surgery or something, so this is a great way to get that stretch and that passive or that active assisted range of motion. so let's take a look at that. for shoulder external rotation passive range of motion with a stick, you can use a cane, a broomstick, or PVC pipe if you have some. the arm is just going to go along for the ride, and the other one's going to do all the movement. bend your elbow and put it by your side, keep it there the whole time, try not and let it come out, then hold on to the pipe with your thumb up and then push outwards and come back in. so remember make sure that elbow is not coming away from your side. number six wall slides. I really love wall slides because again you're using something to kind of help support your arm, so it's just like it sounds, you're sliding up the wall, but it's great because instead of actively doing it all by yourself, you have the wall to kind of help support your arm, and you also have that wall to kind of lean against and push up against to get that extra stretch, so it's a great way to get that stretch. let's check it out. for a shoulder wall slide, place your hand on the wall with your thumb facing outwards, slide your hand up the wall as far as you comfortably can. number seven internal rotation stretch with the towel. this one's kind of tough. it's a little bit uncomfortable, but it's going to be the one that helps get that arm up behind your back, that internal rotation motion. it's not always comfortable sometimes a little bit painful if you've had that rotator cuff injury, this is usually the hardest one to get back, but using a towel really helps stretch and get that movement back. so let's take a look at that. for an internal rotation towel stretch, roll up a towel and with the hand that you're not going to stretch with, put it up and behind you. then the one you want to stretch it's going to go down behind you and then you're going to pull upwards. so I'm gonna turn around so you can see it. number eight. another great way to get that internal rotation, but not maybe going back behind you but just getting that internal rotation stretch is what we call a sleeper stretch. this one's really great too, and you can use your other arm to kind of help push through it which is nice again it's a little uncomfortable, but you know you don't want to be in pain while you're doing it, you just want to feel a lot of tension while you're doing it. so let's check it out. for shoulder internal rotation sleeper stretch, the arm that you're going to stretch is on the ground. put your shoulder and elbow at about a ninety degree angle, and then take your other hand and push it downwards towards the floor until you feel a stretch. number nine a corner stretch. this is really just to help open up those chest muscles .it's a great way again to get that stretch using the wall to kind of help push through that stretch and all these muscles in here. again some of them might not specifically be those rotator cuff muscles, but they're muscles that are really important to keep stretched and loose and help that whole rotator cuff in general, so let's check out the corner stretch. for a corner chest stretch, place a hand on each side of the corner and one foot in the corner then push in and hold the stretch. number ten a prayer stretch, or in yoga sometimes they call it the Child's Pose. this is another one of my favorites because if you can get comfortably in this position you can just relax your whole body and let your shoulders get that stretch. you can go a little bit side to side or you can just go straight down for that shoulder flexion. I really really like this one so let's check it out. for the prayer stretch, start off sitting on your feet and then you're going to push your arms straight out in front of you on the ground holding the stretch. so there you have, it those were the top ten stretches for the rotator cuff. if you'd like to help support my channel, make sure you click on the link up here to find out how, and don't forget to subscribe by clicking down here, and remember be safe, have fun, and I hope you feel better soon.",

        "video_title": "5 Best Cervical Stenosis Exercises & Stretches - Ask Doctor Jo",
        "video_sub_title": "hey everybody it's Doctor Jo and unicorn Remy, and today I'm gonna show you my top 5 ways to relieve cervical stenosis so let's get started. so for cervical stenosis, which is stenosis in your neck, and stenosis is just narrowing of the canals where the nerves go out. and so when those canals get smaller, then it presses on the nerve and that's what causes a lot of the pain. so going back into extension a lot of times will aggravate that pain because it'll make those canals even smaller. so what I want to start off with is an active range of motion movement combined with isometric exercises. and so isometric exercises are basically you're contracting the muscle, but you're not moving. so it makes it less painful. and then you say \"active range of motion isometrics not moving, how do I do that?\" well you're gonna start off with the isometric exercise. so you're gonna push into something, usually your hand, to get that activation of the muscle and then relax and then you're going to do that a couple times. and then do the active range of motion because a lot of times if you're limited in the motion and you do those isometrics, then you'll have more motion. so we're just going to start off with the cervical side bending. so if you're going this way, and let's say you just try it once or twice and it's pretty tight, I'm just gonna place my hand on the side of my head, and I'm gonna push into my hand, and going that direction, but I'm not gonna go anywhere because I'm just pushing into the hand. so just push for about three to five seconds. I'm really just not pushing it a hundred percent, maybe just starting off with about 50 percent of your push, but push into it, relax, do that maybe twice in one spot, and then try going over again and see if you get a little bit further than you did before. if you do then go over a little bit just to the point where you're maybe starting to feel some pain, and then do that isometric exercise again. so pushing into it, relax, pushing into it, and then lots of times you can then go even more into that range of motion after you do that. so do that on both sides pushing in, going a little bit further, pushing in, but when you're activating the muscle you're just staying in one spot. so you can do that with side bending, you can also do that with cervical rotation. so this time I'm doing this motion, but now I'm just pushing into my hand again, but the motion that I'm doing is this. so if I get to here and it's tight, then I push, push, relax, and then usually I can turn just a little bit more. so that's the way to kind of combine them together and usually it's really good because it just helps kind of loosen everything up, but you're strengthening at the same time. so then the next one is going to be a chin tuck. so with chin tucks, you if you've seen some of my other videos, it's really one of my favorites because it's not only a stretch, but again it's an exercise as well. so with the chin tuck you're not tucking down, but you're taking that chin and tucking it back. you want to keep your chin at a at a level kind of neutral position. so you're not pushing in like this, you're not pushing up like this, but just straight ahead and taking that chin and pushing back. so it's almost like if there was a wall here, you're trying to push your head into that wall, and then it's going to give you like a lot of little Chin's right there. so just holding it for about three to five seconds in that position. so you're pulling in, holding it, and then a lot of times you'll see once you let go, you're not going back as far because it's kind of resetting all those muscles. these these muscles get really really tight and a lot of times when those muscles get tight again is pulling on those vertebrae and really shortening making those canals a little bit smaller. so if you have those nice and loose, it helps relax that area and then doesn't put as much pain or pressure on those nerves. so you can do those five times holding each one three to five seconds. so then the next one is just going to be a full stretch. so you're going into getting those 30 second holds doing three times. so we're gonna do an upper trap stretch. those upper traps all the way up here in the back of the neck, so again when those are really tight that causes a lot of pain and it puts pressure on that cervical stenosis. so having those looser we'll take that pressure off of that area. so the side that you want to stretch take your hand and just kind of sit on it. if you if it's too uncomfortable to sit on it, if you're sitting in a chair, you can just kind of take your hand and push it, but by sitting on it it keeps that shoulder down to give you a better stretch. if I'm stretching my right side then I'm going to take my left hand and I'm just pulling my head over like I'm trying to get my ear to my shoulder. so I'm just giving a gentle pull, and I should feel a stretch right kind of in the back along the side of the neck through here. and again so you're holding it for 30 seconds. and with the stenosis I would definitely do both sides, so then after the 30 seconds then switch hand underneath pulling over to the side. it should be a comfortable stretch, kind of tension and pressure but not painful. so three times on each side. I usually alternate back and forth. if you want to do them all on one side, you can, but you don't have to. so the next stretch is going to be a levator scapulae stretch. that muscle is the one that's back here it connects to your shoulder blade or your scapula and then it pulls it up like this, but it comes all the way up into the neck and that cervical spine, so when it's tight it puts a lot of pressure on that spine. and again and also stress when you hold it up there causes a lot of pain too. so it's really good to stretch out. so this time the side you want to stretch you're just gonna take your hand and kind of put it back here where you almost want to take that elbow and point it towards the ceiling. if you can't do that or that's uncomfortable that's okay, you don't have to. that's just again pulling that or pushing that shoulder blade down to hold it in place. some people just hold their arm up, that's fine to do - I just like it a little bit better like this. then you're gonna take the other hand and put it behind your head. and you're gonna not come down straight forward, not out to the side, but kind of at an angle. so take your nose and go down towards your opposite knee. that's the angle you want to go to. and then you're just gonna stretch through this way and you should feel that stretch right back through here. so again it should only be tension, a little bit of pressure, it shouldn't be pain, and holding it for 30 seconds, doing three on each side. so the last one is going to be an anterior scalene stretch. and again these muscles in here have a lot to do with that whole cervical region, so when they're tight they're just pulling and putting a lot of pressure in that area. and so getting those loosened up is really going to help that stenosis. so this time what you want to do, I'm stretching this side, I'm going to take my opposite hand and just kind of place it on my collarbone or that clavicle right there. then I'm gonna turn my head away and then lift up my ear like I'm I'm taking that year towards the ceiling. and I should feel that nice stretch through right here. and just kind of holding that collarbone down there just helps enhance the stretch a little bit. so you don't have to, you can just kind of turn and look up, but I always get a little bit of a better stretch if I pull down that way. so again this is another one where you're doing it for 30 seconds, doing three on each side. so those are my top five ways to relieve cervical stenosis. if you'd like to help support my channel, make sure you click on the link up there. and don't forget to subscribe by clicking down there. and remember be safe, have fun, and I hope you feel better soon.",

        "video_sub_title": "hello I'm dr. Jeanne Galloway and I'm a naturopathic physician that works in central Family Practice in Austin Texas and I wanted to talk to you today about the use of tea tree oil which is an essential oil and toenail fungus boy-toy toenail fungus is something that is very prevalent in the world one of the reasons that is is because the lower parts of the body have a much poorer circulation than the upper parts do it's that much further away from the heart so the pressure of getting the blood flow there is a little bit more challenging so that means that fungal and infestation and like healing is a lot slower in that part of the body so some of the times you know I would say almost everybody developed some sort of toenail fungus as they get older and older and as the circulation changes what you can do with essential oils to help improve your outcome and to reduce the amount of damage that it's doing to your toenail is to actually a couple of things you can take tea tree oil put it on a cotton ball or a couple of cotton balls and just stick that in the toe of those clothes of the toe of those closed toe shoes that you wear and do that overnight just put them in there overnight so that the fungus that might be growing in the bottom of that shoe isn't going to be getting on your toes then the whole rest of the next day so even through the sock sometimes there can be sweat and there's capacities of getting on to the toenails so that's one thing you can do as sort of a preventive to prevent it you've getting it on your foot the other things are to actually take some what we would call a carrier oil maybe something like sunflower oil or it could be apricot oil it's a variety of different thin oils that can be used take some of the tea tree oil and you put a baby about five or six drops of the tea tree oil into a small amount of your carrier oil and then you can apply that to the toenail trying to get underneath the nail bed if this is my toe trying to get underneath that toenail edge as much as you can and also around in this area you can do that before going to bed you can do that before heading out for the day it's a good thing to use tea tree oil to try to prevent fungal infections of the toe",

        "video_title": "10 Rotator Cuff Exercises for Pain Relief (Non-surgical Rehab)",
        "video_sub_title": "there are a surprisingly high number of people who have rotator cuff injuries each year over 3 million people to be exact and while surgery may be the best option for some people the fact is that non-surgical rotator cuff treatment can really help decrease pain and improve function of your shoulder one study reported a 75 success rate for non-operative treatment like physical therapy and as a physical therapist myself i've worked with a lot of people who've had partial to full thickness rotator cuff tears and after a few weeks of physical therapy their function had improved significantly so today we're going over the top 10 exercises that i share in the clinic to help my patients who are having pain because of a rotator cuff injury and it's very important to say that you should always check in with your own physical therapist or your surgeon or your physician before doing any of these movements these exercises are part of my non-surgical rotator cuff rehab program so if you're recovering from an actual surgery you need to follow the timeline and the protocol from your surgeon and physical therapist so the first exercise is called the pendulum exercise and to perform this movement start with your feet about shoulder width apart and hold on to a chair or a countertop and lean over to allow your painful arm to hang there keep your arm as relaxed as possible and shift your body to cause your arm to swing like a pendulum back and forth or even in a circular motion now this is a great way to relieve pressure in the shoulder as the hanging provides a distraction of the shoulder joint which can be increased by holding a small weight try to perform this movement throughout the day because that can be helpful to relieve pain and it only takes a few seconds to do when i recommend this to my patients i tell them to aim to perform this motion for 20-30 seconds at a time multiple times a day the second exercise is called scapular retraction or simply shoulder squeezes not only does this help your overall posture but this exercise is important for activating the muscles that support the shoulder and the rotator cuff now the key to this exercise is to keep your neck relaxed and to squeeze your shoulder blades together holding for about one to two seconds and repeating this 15 to 20 times it's the perfect exercise to do every couple of hours especially if you work behind a computer or you find yourself sitting for long periods of time okay for this next exercise you'll need a flat surface and a stick it doesn't have to be as fancy as this handmade oak cane from brazos down in waco texas but that's what i'm using because i think it's cool for people who have really limited range of motion i have them do the first two exercises along with this third movement and while it may seem very basic these movements are really important because we want to make sure that you have as much pain-free motion as possible before we start emphasizing other strengthening exercises and movements on a flat surface holding a broomstick or a cane or a golf club extend both of your arms down towards your knees which can be bent into this comfortable position now bring your arms into full flexion but stop at the point where you start to feel discomfort bring your arms back down and continue the movement 10 to 12 times you'll start to notice that you can go further and further each time as you do this exercise two to three times a day it'll become a lot easier especially if your injury is pretty recent you can also try using the stick to bring your arm out into abduction which means moving your arm out to the side exercise number four is called the serratus punch because it targets the serratus anterior muscle now to do this motion lie on your back and bring your arm to 90 degrees now reach up towards the ceiling like you're performing a slow punch to extend your arm forward you don't need any weight to start out but if it feels really comfortable as you do this you can work up to a one or two maybe even three pound weight as you progress and for this exercise try to perform three sets of 10 to 12 repetitions this fifth exercise is called a wall slide now a lot of times my patients with rotator cuff tears will have a difficult time raising their arm above head level which can be a real problem if you're trying to reach into a cabinet or just reach to the back of your head in the morning when you're fixing your hair and they're often really surprised with how high they can reach when they use a wall for support so as simple as this sounds we're going to turn it into an exercise sliding your arm up the wall but make sure you keep your neck relaxed and only go as far as you can without pain now it's also important to keep your arms relaxed as you slide your arms back down and repeat this movement 10 to 15 times you don't have to do this movement 200 times a day but try to perform it two to three sets of 10 to 15 wall slides a day okay number six is called countertop planks and i like this movement because it promotes stability in the shoulder and it's really easy to perform anywhere you have a countertop or a tabletop you just place your hands shoulder width apart and hold that position for 10 to 15 seconds you can even shift your weight towards one arm and gradually progress the movement to lift your arm as it becomes stronger and easier to do and since it doesn't take too long to perform it's easy to mix this exercise in throughout your day at the office at home performing it every time you're in the kitchen or in the bathroom or wherever you are wherever you have a countertop available this countertop plank is a great exercise for shoulder stability the seventh exercise is called side lying external rotation and it really isolates the rotator cuff muscles there's actually three of the four rotator cuff muscles that perform external rotation and it can be really difficult or painful to perform if you have a rotator cuff tear so we want to be really careful when you're performing this movement and do so in a pain-free range of motion if possible before you start place a rolled up towel under your elbow between your arm and your body as this will help to avoid strain to your shoulder and it will really isolate the muscles that we need to strengthen here gently rotate your arm like you're spinning it on a rod allowing it to rotate as your hand moves towards the ceiling just be careful not to lift your arm off your body as you perform this motion you don't actually need weight to begin to do this exercise but after a few days or a couple weeks you might be able to progress to a pound or two pounds if you're able to even three pounds if you're getting stronger like most of these other exercises try to do two to three sets of 10 to 12 repetitions of this exercise and of course stop if you're feeling pain or if you're only able to go a certain distance without pain just do that partial range okay number eight is the resisted row now we're actually going to be breaking into some big weights here some bands and these aren't any bands these are some bob and brad bands have you not heard of bob and brad i'm sure you've heard of bob and brad they're the two most famous physical therapists on the internet in their opinion of course there are a couple helpful physical therapists who make physical therapy videos treatment videos and products like these bands you can pick up on amazon so thanks bob and brad for sending them out these are the ones we're using today now the idea with a resisted row is to keep your neck relaxed and to perform the scapular squeeze you remember the shoulder squeeze as you bring your arms towards your body now this movement should not be painful but it may get tiring as you perform two to three sets of ten rows with the resistance band and you don't need much resistance to engage the muscles of your shoulder so i like to start with a red or yellow band and then work my way up to the green band when i'm working with patients who aren't really familiar with this type of resisted row you can also hook the bands into a door by using this little attachment that clips into a door and you can clip your bands onto it i think that's a great option for people who don't have a pole to hook their bands around hooking it into the door with this little slip is really easy okay on to exercise number nine which is resisted shoulder rotation we'll be using a band whether that's the yellow or the red band i'll give you two variations of how to do it one without a door and the second one with using the door and the door stopper the first way to perform the movement is with both arms keeping your elbows at your side while stretching the band apart it's helpful here to squeeze your shoulder blades before you initiate the rotation with your arms because it helps to stabilize your shoulders you can also loop the band around a pole or if you have the door loop that comes with resistance bands that i'm using you can slide it in the door and perform a unilateral or a single armed movement i actually like isolating the rotator cuff this way with a single band tied into the door because i can use both external and internal rotation by just turning around and using the band to provide resistance as i bring my arm towards my body like i said with most of these exercises i recommend performing two to three sets of 10 or 12 repetitions as long as the movement is pain free and finally on to number 10 this is definitely one of the more advanced movements that i perform with my patients when they've demonstrated a few weeks of improvement with their strength and their motion after a rotator cuff injury i call this exercise the diagonal band exercise and it works like this start by initiating a small shoulder blade squeeze and stretch the band in a diagonal pattern bringing one arm up and the other arm down to the side return to the starting position and repeat the movement in the opposite direction as you continue to focus on setting your shoulders with that small squeeze of your shoulder blades if you find this movement to be really hard make sure you're using a light band like the yellow band you can use the bands at the wall to perform this motion as well which can provide a little bit more stability as you incorporate some resistance into this movement using the wall okay so there you have it 10 exercise ideas that i commonly use with my patients for non-operative rotator cuff rehabilitation again remember if you've just had rotator cuff surgery follow the protocol from your physician and your physical therapist but if you're interested in using the tools that i'm using today check them out in the description below if you found this video to be helpful i'd love it if you gave it a like below and also be sure to subscribe to the channel for

        "video_sub_title": "welcome to our program today were chatting with dr. Nikolas Busse iske he is a steward emergency medicine physician and he's here to talk about a very helpful at home treatment and this is really for common minor injuries so say somebody stumbles down the steps or they're out ice skating and they hurt their ankle what are the things you should do right away well Mary that's a really good question and there is in fact a method known as the rice method that you can use at home rice stands for rest ice compression and elevation and if you don't mind being my patient I'll show you how it's done of course did I take off your shoes absolutely okay so the first thing that you want to do in the rice method is rest your ankle and basically what that consists of is managing the amount of work that you do what your ankle if that means actually not walking as much you can do that if that means you need to use a crutch in order to reduce the amount of weight that you put on the ankle you can do that ice the next thing is relatively self-explanatory you can use a nice little it's a cold pack like this one used or you can use just a bag of peas that you find in your freezer so you pop that and you can rest it on the ankle pacifically the place where hurts and you leave it on your ankle for probably about 15 minutes and it's ideal for you to have a thin little layer underneath the rest of the ice pack excuse me in order to make sure that you don't burn the skin with the ice okay 15 minutes on you can do this several times a day for the next 24 or 48 hours and sometimes longer if you feel like you need to next portion is actually compression and so what I'll have you do if I can have you just bring your ankle over here a little bit um you want to use an e strap and basically what you want to do is you want to start up at the ankle and roll around and you want to have nice compression here and this is going to help reduce the amount of swelling and you want to overlap the east wrap probably about fifty percent or half way every time you cross over and you want this to be snug but you don't want it to be uncomfortably tight the last portion of this is the elevation portion so this is when you're at home after a long day of work or maybe if your boss lets you you can rest up your ankle while you're at work elevation the key part is and this is for the swelling is to make sure that it's above the level of your heart okay if at any point in time you feel as if your ankle is unstable you're not able to walk on it or if anything else makes you concerned you need to come and see me in the emergency department from Azusa thank you for being with us today this was very helpful information I'm sure for our audience and thank you for joining us today",

        "video_title": "Fungal Infection of the Scalp (Tinea Capitis) | Causes, Risk Factors, Symptoms, Diagnosis, Treatment",
        "video_sub_title": "hey everyone this lesson is on tiny capitus or a fungal infection of the scalp in this lesson we're going to talk about what causes this condition some of the risk factors for getting tiny capitalists we're also going to talk about some of the signs and symptoms how we can diagnose it and how we can treat it so as we mentioned before tinea capitus is an infection of the scalp of the head caused by fungi known as dermatophytes and here is an image of tinea capitus so the word tinea capitis tinnia refers to a fungal infection and you can think of cap of the head to help you remember capitus and remember where this condition occurs and as you can see here in this image you can see scaling and this infection can actually cause damage to the hair and hair follicles leading to hair loss or what we call alopecia antinea capitis most commonly occurs in children but can affect individuals of all ages and what are some of the causative organisms of tinea capitis well the most common predominant organism actually depends on where you live in the world so trichophyton tonsins actually is the most common causative organism of tinea capitus in north america united kingdom and france whereas microsporum canis which is another dermatophyte is actually the most common causative organism in australia and central europe other trichophyton and microsporum species can cause tinnitus as well but to a lesser extent so trichophyton tantrums is again the most common causative organism in north america united kingdom and france whereas microsporum canis affects other areas of the world including australia central europe and china now the transmission of tinea capitus involves direct contact so that could be either head to head so if an individual has tindicapitus and you were to touch one head to another you could essentially transmit that fungi from the infected individual to a non-infected individual you could also touch a surface or touch an individual or touch the fungi itself and touch your head that could lead to the transmission and it could also be from some indirect object as well such as a baseball cap anything that is carrying the causative organism and eventually leading to direct contact to your head can lead to this type of infection so again it's always direct contact but it could be multiple ways of transmitting it directly head to head hand to head or head to object and different dermatophyte species can come from different places so humans harbor a certain number that can transmit from person to person you could get a certain dermatophyte fungi from an animal or even from the soil so once we come into contact with these dermatophytes how do they cause infection so the dermatophytes cause infection by several mechanisms one of those is that they utilize what is called mannins which are components of their cell walls these mannins allow them to adhere to keratinocytes and keratinocytes are what make up your skin and your hair so they use these mannins to adhere to stick to these keratinocytes the mannins can also cause some local immunosuppression allowing them to cause infection at that site the dermatophytes can then release digestive enzymes known as keratinases and other proteinases that allows them to penetrate and extend down into the hair shaft causing infection and damage to hair follicles and there are actually three types or variations of infection one of those is known as ectothricks the second is known as endotherics and the third is flavis we're going to talk about these three types of infections in the next couple of slides what are some of the risk factors for getting tinea capitus one of those risk factors is genetic predisposition individuals with decreased beta defense in levels and beta defenses are involved in your innate immune system if you have decreased levels of these beta defenses you're at an increased risk for getting fungal infections like tinnitus another risk factor for getting tinea capitus is immunocompromised so this can be from a variety of ways could be from medications or it could be from some type of cancer that could be increasing your risk of getting immunosuppression leading to increased risk of getting this type of infection but other types of infections as well the third is systemic diseases and this can include diabetes and anemia and again these can all lead to compromised immune systems and the fourth risk factor not listed here is direct contact of your head with other individuals who might be infected with this type of fungus so that is the other risk factor so it could be other people who are infected could be animals or it could be the soil anything that's directly contacting your scalp that is also a risk factor as well so what does tinea capitus look like so here is one image of tinny capitus we've seen before and here is another clinical presentation of titanic capitus so we're going to talk about these in more detail so tiny capitus is a spectrum it can be anything from mild to severe so can have areas of mild hair loss to severe hair loss there are often times what we call pruritic patches or itchy patches so we can see things like this like a scaling lesion that are itchy so we can see here there's scaling involved and there's also alopecia there's hair loss in the area and we can also see brittle and broken hair so along with the alopecia you might see brittle or shortened or truncated hair so in some instances you might see two to three millimeter long hair that's just above the scalp and we see this in that ecto-thrix type of infection we talked about before so ectothick's type of infection is where the dermatophyte infects the hair shaft at the mid shaft level so kind of in the middle or slightly away from the lower edge of the follicle so it affects the hair at mid shaft level this leads to breakage of the hair and usually we can see two to three millimeter long hair just above the scalp and the ectostrix type of infection is often caused by dermatophytes of the genus microsporum we can also see something called black dots or black dot tinea capitus these black dots are actually broken hair right at the level of the scalp so they're not two to three millimeters above the scalp it's actually right at the scalp and this is what we call endotherics type of infection so if we look here we can actually see these black dots these little spots here this is actually the hair that's broken right at the level of the scalp and there are actually two other clinical presentations of tinny capitals i want to talk about one of those is the favis or the favis type of infection this causes a clinical presentation that we can sometimes refer to as tenia fevosa this type of infection or this presentation is often mostly caused by the dermatophyte known as trichophyton scone lineai and sorry about the pronunciation there this leads to a reaction involving excessive crusting lesions that are called scutula and all of this presentation is due to an excessive inflammatory response we may also see nodules that ooze and drain and sometimes the entire scalp can be affected by this this presentation is very rare but can occur more often in certain countries specifically countries in africa and because it leads to extensive infection of the scalp it can lead to extensive hair loss and when we look at the crusting lesions in a fabulous infection they are described as white to yellow in color and cup shaped in their appearance and the fourth type of clinical presentation i want to talk about with regards to tinea capitis is what is called corian or carrion so kurian can be a severe clinical presentation of a normal tiny capitalist it can look like what we talked about in the last slide that could get extremely bad and worse and it lead to something like this more often times a current is caused by an infection with a specific trichophyton species known as trichophyton varicosam what the korean is is that it is a painful abscess on the scalp caused by the infection and the infection can get so large it can lead to scarring alopecia so it leads to hair loss that won't recover because that area of the scalp has been replaced by scar tissue what we do see is that the hairs in the abscess are very loose and it can fall out very easily the abscess itself might drain and oftentimes we see lymphadenopathy present which is tender lymph nodes that are associated because of the large abscess we might even see fever and chills these individuals may feel very ill as well so how do we diagnose teeny capitus so the diagnosis of tinny capitus is oftentimes a clinical diagnosis we take the history of the individual we see their risk factors and we see the clinical presentation and that can lead us to our diagnosis we can also do a potassium hydroxide wet mount or koh wet mound so we take some skin scrapings again from the tinia capitus lesions and then we can look under the microscope and see hyphae so how do we treat tiny capitis the first thing we want to do is try to modify the risk factors we can't modify their genetics but we can try to modify some of those systemic conditions that might be increasing their risk for getting infections like tinnitus one of those could be diabetes if their blood sugars are very high we want to try to get those blood sugars under control in in a good normal range that can help reduce the risk of getting infections like tiny capitalists for treatment of the tinea campuses itself we need to use systemic oral antifungals these are required because the topical antifungal treatments are not effective this type of treatment is very distinct to tinea capitus compared to other types of tinnia infections because other types of fungal infections usually only require topical anti-fungal treatments whereas tinea capitus requires systemic or a pill form or oral form of the anti-fungal one of those treatments that we can use for tinea capitis is something called graciofulvin so graciofulvin is a pill form it's a systemic oral antifungal and you have to take it for a long period of time four to eight weeks so these types of infections can take a long time to resolve we can also use turbinating this is another type of systemic oral antifungal we could use and we could also use intraconozol as well these other systemic oral antifungals also take a lot of time they take weeks sometimes four to six to eight weeks at a time so diagnosis of tiny capitalism is oftentimes a clinical diagnosis but you could do a potassium hydroxide wet mount looking for hyphae and then the treatment involves modifying the risk factors and using systemic oral antifungals not topical antifungals and the systemic oral antifungals you can use are graciofulvin terminifine or draconisol for more information please check out my other fungal infection lessons and if you like this video

        "video_title": "Cat Scratch Disease | Causes, Symptoms and Treatment",
        "video_sub_title": "hey everyone this wasn't talking about cat scratch disease you might have heard of this as cat scratch fever buts cat scratch disease is an infection caused by the intracellular bacteria known as bartonella henselae which is a gram-negative bacteria here is an image of that bacteria now this is why this can this disease can be referred to as Bartonella Llosa's because of an infection with Bartonella now cat scratch disease as its name implies is that it is cat to human transmission that means that we can get cat scratch disease from a cat through a scratch or a bite now cats are the natural reservoirs for bartonella henselae but fleas are actually a vector of transmission so fleas can actually pass bartonella henselae from cat to cat so if our cat is an indoor cat that has never been outside that's never been exposed to fleas it's less likely to carry this bacteria now when a human does get infected with bartonella henselae through a cat scratch or cat bite that bacteria that bartonella henselae will invade the endothelial cells in that person it will lead to an acute inflammatory reaction it leads to the activation of a pro-inflammatory cascade which will cause some of the symptoms we're going to talk about in the next slide so what is the clinical presentation of cat scratch disease one of the biggest ones is a skin lesion this makes sense if we get bit by a cat or scratched by a cat there's a lesion but there's a particular lesion with cat scratch disease and it occurs generally three to ten days after inoculation of the bacteria it leads to a vesicular or an erythema or a popular lesion and this lesion will stick around for about one to three weeks the lesion looks like this so in these pictures we see Possible's cat-scratch here and we get these little popular type lesions this is the characteristic look of the skin lesion in cat-scratch disease now another big symptom that we see in cat-scratch disease that usually is the defining symptom in this disease is regional lymph adenopathy this usually occurs two weeks post inoculation so after about two weeks after the individual has been inoculated with the bacteria we start to see this regional lymph adenopathy is proximal to the inoculation and it is tender so we generally if a cat scratch or bite occurs in the arm we can see this tender proximal lymphadenopathy usually in the axillary nodes so we can see in this picture here that we get this tender lymph adenopathy axillary nodes proximal to the inoculation so this is a key presentation in cat scratch disease as well and the third most common symptom is a fever that's why cat scratch disease is considered a febrile lymphadenopathy fever with regional lymph adenopathy and if you see an unexplained fever in an individual perhaps they have cats think about this as a possible cause now other than these three most common signs and symptoms there's also certain instances where individuals can have a disseminated disease a disseminated cat scratch disease and it's unsure about the pathology or the pathophysiology as to why this happens but a subset of patients can get dissemination of their cat scratch disease can lead to hepatosplenomegaly so an enlargement of their spleen and an illusion of their deliverer they can get retinitis and inflammation of the retina in their eyes and they can also get encephalopathy so again this is this occurs in rare instances but it can be caused by cat scratches either can be a dissemination of the cat scratch illness but generally in most cases in most often it is a self-limiting disease so generally patients only get skin lesions reading regional and fatten of the and fever and it often is a self-limiting disease so how do we diagnose and treat cat scratch disease diagnosis involves serology we look at IG m and IgG levels IgM and IgG serology has low sensitivity but a high specificity so if we see I Jim r IG G antibodies to bartonella henselae we can affirm that they have a diagnosis of Barton neurosis or a diagnosis of cat scratch disease PCEHR can also be performed to look at DNA or genetics involving b Hensel a lymph node biopsy can also be performed although this is generally not required just because if we can see the history and get good serology and a possible PCR we maybe will make the diagnosis treatment is generally supportive oftentimes this is a self-limiting disease we often leave it we are we provide supportive treatment however if there's a lymphadenitis Sophie get a lymph adenopathy if it's a moderate to severe if the patient's very ill or if the patient is immunodeficient we want to treat this we want to treat it with azithromycin azithromycin for 10 to 14 days and if this is a disseminated disease if it's a severe case of disseminated disease of cat scratch disease we want to give a zither Meissen or doxycycline with rifampin so that's the only difference we add with amp and or we use doxycycline and refampin or disseminated disease so anyways guys hope you found this lesson helpful that was a lesson on cat scratch disease if you found this lesson helpful please like and subscribe

        "video_title": "5 Easy Ways to Relieve & Prevent Leg Cramps",
        "video_sub_title": "hey everybody it's doctor Jo, and today I'm going to show you five ways to prevent leg cramps. so let's get started. so often with leg cramps, they can happen in three of the big muscles in the legs. they can happen in the calves, they can have in the quads, and they can happen in the hamstrings in the back. so we're really just going to stretch those out, and these can also be used to relieve cramps. so if you're having an active cramp, you can do the stretches as well. and I'm going to talk about some other treatments too, so the first one is just going to be for the calves doing a calve right. so I like the runner stretch, especially if you're standing, it's a really easy one to do. so if I want to stretch out the calf on this side, I'm gonna put that foot back behind me. the other one's just gonna be in the front. you can be against a wall, you can be against a counter top, or a chair, just something sturdy to kind of hold on to because you want to have your balance so you can focus on the stretch. the leg in the back, you want your heel to be all the way down, and you want your toes pointed forward. sometimes a lot of people will turn their foot out that way. then you're not gonna stretch the calf muscles, so make sure your foot's pointed forward and that your heel is down. keep that heel down the whole time, and then with your front knee you're just gonna lean forward until you feel a stretch all the way through that calf muscle back there. and then you're gonna hold that stretch for 30 seconds. so after you do that 30 seconds, give it a little break, shake it out, and then you're gonna do that a total of three times. so again the heel down, toes pointed forward, bending the front knee to get that nice stretch in there, and then holding that for 30 seconds. so then the next one is going to go into a hamstring stretch. again there's a lot of different ways you can stretch all these muscles, so if these don't work for you, you can do them lying down on the floor, you can do them sitting in a chair, and you can check all those out in my videos. but just prop it up if your standing. maybe you know if there's a chair or a stool you can even just prop it on the floor, but to get a little bit better stretch you're just gonna have it in front of you. try and keep your knees straight, that's what's really going to stretch out those hamstrings. if you want to get a little extra stretch you can pull your toes up towards you in that I'll get the calf stretching as well. but the key to this one is you want your hips to be forward. so you don't want to be turned like this and stretching, you really want those hips to be pointing forward. and you're just gonna bend at your hips. you're hinging forward. you're not rolling your back down like this where I can touch my toes easily because then I'm not stretching my hamstrings. so you want to bend at your hips and keep your back straight. so I'm getting more of a stretch through my hamstrings here than if I were to curl my back and try and touch my toes. so again just leaning forward, keeping that back straight, keeping the knee straight. I might even feel the stretch here because those hamstrings cross that knee all the way up to the bottom area. so again you're holding it for 30 seconds. you're doing that three times. if you're cramping in both legs, make sure and do that on both sides. so another great treatment to help prevent or even relieve leg cramps is using compression socks, and the folks at Dovava sport sent me their Dovava dry stretch compression socks, and these are about 15 to 20 millimeters of mercury, which is how much compression you have. and so they're nice athletic socks. so when you're using compression socks what that does is that helps move the fluid back out of your leg. so if you're cramping, if your muscles aren't really doing what they're supposed to, a lot of times compression socks do a good job of increasing the circulation to the area, so that's why those are really good. the next one is just going to be a quad stretch for that quad muscle. so sometimes people have you know those charley horses in their quad muscles, and again there's lots of different ways you can stretch it. if you're standing especially if you're you know coming from a run or getting ready to go on a run, and you want to try and prevent those cramps, you can just hold on to something. again make sure you're holding on for balance. so you're not having to focus on your balance while you're stretching. and then you're just going to grab the back of your foot. and you can come up this way and grab it first, but you really want the top of your leg to be straight down. so if I'm looking down my knee is pointed towards the floor. if it's forward like this, I'm not really getting that quad stretch. I want to make sure that if you're looking at me sideways both thighs are about even with each other. and then you're just going to pull your heel back as far as you can. you might not be able to go as far as me, that's okay I stretch every day. and if you want even a little bit more of a stretch you can bring it back behind you some, and that'll get a little bit of your hip flexors as well. but again, it's still that 30-second stretch doing that three times, especially on both sides if both legs are cramping. and then the last one is really just staying hydrated. being dehydrated is probably one of the most common reasons of having cramps in your legs, but if you're staying hydrated and you're doing your stretches and exercises and you're still getting your cramps, you know especially at night when people get cramps at night. if none of this is helping, make sure you go check with your doctor because a lot of times leg cramps are an indication of things like low potassium, even low iron. it might be a sign that you're anemic. it can be a sign the diabetes are coming on, or even something like peripheral neuropathy. so if it's not a simple fix, if these aren't working, it might actually be something that's you know a symptom of something a little more serious. so make sure and go check with your doctor. and if you're interested in purchasing the socks, make sure and click on the link up here, and don't forget to subscribe by clicking down there. and remember be safe, have fun, and I hope you feel better soon.",

        "video_sub_title": "you we're going to be laying out the tent sections to start the layout of the tent when you're unloading your tent sections from your vehicle you want to be extremely careful that you do not snag the sections on any sharp edges you can have so many center sections as you want in other words there could be as many Center poles as you want right now they've got the two end pieces and then the center piece in the middle now Josiah's going to take the tent bag off of the tent section you need to make very sure that when you lay the tent section over to begin unrolling the tent section that you do not allow anyone to pull the rope out from underneath the tent section like you see here the weight of the tent section on the rope will cause friction on the tent if the Rope is pulled out from underneath the tent and it will actually burn a hole in the tent once you have all your tent sections safely untied then you begin to roll them all out in a long line like you see Josiah and the other guys doing here makes no difference whether you have two sections or four or five sections they still will all be rolled out in a long line into end prior to the unfolding now you can see Mike and the other men they're unfolding the first in Section one fold at a time to prevent abrasion on the tent over and over they will unfold it until it's completely unfolded in this case since it's a sixty by ninety tent that they are installing there are three sections to in sections in one middle section the first in section is already unfolded and now the guys are unfolding the center section after that they will unfold the last in section then all the sections will be ready to start lacing together okay now Josiah is going to explain to us how to lace the tent up you're going to take your first row on your lay side okay your first deal take it through your first loop first hole pull it through take your second one stick it through the second pull it through the first one sure yep pretty much pretty much do that the whole way down this sequence just continues over and over all the way from the center to the perimeter you've reached the end of the row when you get here you got a rope that's a little bit longer so second one from the end this one here is a little bit longer than the rest of them this one all you do is you take you put through this hole you take this one actually this one goes back through this one the only thing you do different here is this one goes through here comes back the opposite way pull it back basically all I did was took this one the same thing up to here and instead of going like this like I usually would say this I'm gonna go like this back to opposite I'm going to take it and I wrap it around pull it through like this twice until half inch yes then you just snap you up one more snap on the very end here take it that's it what's this flap here call the weather flap it covers your lace line to keep rain from getting through your lace line just a piece of cloth piece of material that goes over the top of it and it ropes down and it keeps raining everything out of that lace line right my thing is make sure it snaps cotton from the lace line ropes should be tied off in a double knot like you see here hey Mike why don't you show us how to string up the Rope for the weather flap let's watch closely because this is important what you do is you take the end of the weather flap rope and you go through the first string on the large triangle like you see there and then you go through the second ring on the triangle and then through the flap and then through the ring on the tent and back through the ring on the flap you just continue to zigzag all the way down to the end of the tent you get your hand you'll make sure you pull all the slack out of the rope but you would all just like at the bottom edge we'll send the top edge because it'd make it easy once you get to taste you got to go back and readjust these drains the full tension of them but just add off Angele maybe enough slack so the tank goes yeah so when the tank goes up it doesn't if you pull this real tight it's gonna pop every one of these rings up so not so you'll make sure you have enough slack and get all the slacks on the edge not the center portion and that's what if we're going to stretch the tin out to get proper spacing for the stage we can get two guys to end on the corners here then Josiah will go down and we'll stretch out the adrian after its stretched out where the four that says take me with you now it's time to stretch the tin out and try to get all the edges in the perimeter of the tent nice and straight so that we'll know exactly where to put the stake this way we can get the stakes in the proper location and make sure that everything is nice and square reason for having the tent the webbing the edge of the tent isolate on top of the other tent section is you want the webbing in a straight line because the center sections are actually longer and with if you were to stretch that flat it would be longer than width and from corner to corner middle is right before you can run a string line you have to set your corner stakes at each corner you will set two stakes five feet away from the corner of the tent what the guys are doing here is they're driving around and around the tent throwing out all of the sakes getting ready to line the stakes up just before they actually start driving the stakes into the ground line up the stakes in a straight line on the edge of the tent using the streamline all right so this is the Cobra these lifesaver now it's time to throw out all of the side poles in preparation for raising the perimeter the easiest way to do this if you have the room is simply to drive around the tent with your vehicle and throw the poles out in the approximate location of each stake okay the hardware is already and we can't start raising the perimeter of the tent before you know it the tin will be up and ready to use whoever raised in a corner and this is the windward side right you always do the side face in the wind um actually we're gonna go around to the downwind side okay we'll start with when the windward corner then we'll work the downwind side and then very last side that whoever be the windward side okay Josiah why don't you show us how to tie these ropes in a knot it's very simple but just go under yes just like that put that over that see then when you want to tighten it are you going to do is push this through they're really tight tying the ropes can be a little bit tricky but it's just a simple double half-hitch first of all you stand up all four corners and then as you've seen you put all the side poles on all four sides of the perimeter and you hook up each rope and tie the knot to the stake maybe the idea is to keep the ropes real loose just enough to hold the tin in place but not too tight the ropes need to be loose so that you have enough slack to insert the quarter poles and all of the center poles later on you'll have time to come back and tighten the ropes okay the wind's blowing this way this is the last corner we do now that the last corner has been raised all we have to do is go back and raise just a few more poles on this last side and we'll be ready to start inserting the quarter poles in the center poles today we're lucky because we have some wind that will help us raise the tent and it'll make it a whole lot easier you can actually see how the wind is raising the tent trying to lift it up now let's watch what Mike shows us how to tie the jump rope on the side pole take the side of the ropes cut it off the ring wrap it around through break it up just below the band pull it tight this foot back the opposite direction one more time around and through quote taut and wrap it around the pole above above each wrapping stuff what is this dear keeps it keeps the pointless the damn start strapping bones they said animals won't fall over get some we have to do this on every side in every size oh we were so long tell them to jump up Shepard okay first chlorophyll which garden the same quadrant that we did with the foot in the acai bowls of correct starving the windward side how cause this bull you do a similar kind of jumper runner sightings a side pole the only difference is it's got two half hitches at the top after you get the quarter poles in if your tent has quarter poles then it's time to insert the center poles the first thing you need to do is put the pin that is on the top end of the pole through both of the large metal rings where the lace lines come together you can see it here in this shop now you have the two rings and the pin goes right through both rings then you take your rope and you make a half hitch there on the pole with the rope this helps keep the pole from falling out if someone unties the road you'll also put a second knot about two feet below that one another half hitch when they raise the center pole you'll notice that they only raise it about half way because you really won't be able to push the pole up all the way until you get a couple more Center poles in to help you you do them in sequence just a little bit on the first Pole and then you go put the next pole in and then you'll come back and straighten all the poles up once you have them all inserted after you push the pole up you'll wrap the end of the rope around and round the pole several times and tuck it in if your tent has quarter poles you don't really push them straight up and down you'll want to leave them at about a 30-degree angle like you see here the quarter pole needs to push outward against the tent this helps keep the tent then if you just have the pole pushed straight up and down one thing to remember as soon as you push a quarter pole or a center pole up you need to easily tied off so the pole cannot fall out and injure someone or tear your tent if the rope is not tied any movement of the tent will allow the pole to fall down and it could potentially damage your tent or injure someone that's working underneath the tent after you get the poles up then you need to align the center poles in a straight line so that your tent will tighten up properly there are several ways to line up the center poles but the main object is to make sure that each Center pole is completely vertical and square with the ground this will help your tent to be nice and square and tighten in the right shape once you have the center poles all lined up nice and straight then it's time to start tightening the tent the normal procedure is to tighten one corner first rather loosely or just snug and then go to the opposite corner and tighten it up good and tight after that you go to the opposite into the tent and you will tighten those two corners as tight as you can you probably will have to return to the first end of the tent and tighten the first two corners at least one more time before you get all four corners real tight now is a good time to go tighten the weather flap ropes if you remember we left them loose at the beginning of the video now is a good time to untie the rope pull all the slack out and then retie it so that it's good and tight this will keep the rainwater from losing underneath the flap and keep the flap from flopping in the wind also now you have to go back and tighten all your side ropes and all your side poles one by one all the way around the perimeter of the tin to get everything extremely tight it's difficult to over tighten it you want to get it just as tight as you possibly can when you get through the tent should be real tight inside now it's very windy you may have to go around the tent several times you're retightening all the ropes over and over till you get everything tight when it's time to hang the wall you simply decide where you want your door and that's where you start to hang the wall first of all you unroll the roll like you see here and then you hang the end of the wall wherever you want your doorway to start that piece of wall will unroll in one direction and your next piece of wall will unroll in the opposite direction this is where later on you can fold the overlapping pieces back to create a doorway each roll wall gets stretched out in a long line like you see here and then you hang it little by little with the snaps onto the road stretching the wall as you go each wall overlaps the other five feet and the way you can tell where the five foot mark is each piece of material in the wall is five feet so every five feet you have a seen anyway you continue this process over and over until you get all the way around the ten you",

        "video_title": "What causes opioid addiction, and why is it so tough to combat? - Mike Davis",
        "video_sub_title": "More than 3,000 years ago,  a flower began to appear in remedies in Ancient Egyptian medical texts. Across the Mediterranean,  the ancient Minoans likely found ways to use  the same plant for its high. Both ancient civilizations  were on to something\u2014 opium,  an extract of the poppy in question, can both induce pleasure  and reduce pain. Though opium has remained  in use ever since, it wasn\u2019t until the 19th century  that one of its chemical compounds, morphine, was identified  and isolated for medical use. Morphine, codeine, and other substances  made directly from the poppy are called opiates. In the 20th century, drug companies  created a slew of synthetic substances similar to these opiates, including heroin, hydrocodone,  oxycodone, and fentanyl. Whether synthetic or derived from opium, these compounds  are collectively known as opioids. Synthetic or natural, legal or illicit,  opioid drugs are very effective painkillers, but they are also highly addictive. In the 1980s and 90s, pharmaceutical companies began  to market opioid painkillers aggressively, actively downplaying  their addictive potential to both the medical community  and the public. The number of opioid painkillers  prescriptions skyrocketed, and so did cases of opioid addiction,  beginning a crisis that continues today. To understand why opioids  are so addictive, it helps to trace how these drugs affect  the human body from the first dose, through repeated use,  to what happens when long-term use stops. Each of these drugs  has slightly different chemistry, but all act on the body\u2019s opioid system by binding to opioid receptors in the brain. The body\u2019s endorphins temper pain signals  by binding to these receptors, and opioid drugs bind  much more strongly, for longer. So opioid drugs can manage much more  severe pain than endorphins can. Opioid receptors also influence everything from mood to normal bodily functions. With these functions, too,  opioids\u2019 binding strength and durability mean their effects  are more pronounced and widespread than those of the body\u2019s  natural signaling molecules. When a drug binds to opioid receptors,  it triggers the release of dopamine, which is linked to feelings of pleasure  and may be responsible for the sense of euphoria  that characterizes an opioid high. At the same time, opioids suppress  the release of noradrenaline, which influences wakefulness, breathing,  digestion, and blood pressure. A therapeutic dose decreases noradrenaline enough to cause side effects like constipation. At higher doses opioids can decrease heart and breathing rates to dangerous levels, causing loss of consciousness  and even death. Over time, the body starts  to develop a tolerance for opioids. It may decrease its number  of opioid receptors, or the receptors may become  less responsive. To experience the same release of dopamine and resulting mood effects as before, people have to take  larger and larger doses\u2014 a cycle that leads to physical dependence  and addiction. As people take more opioids  to compensate for tolerance, noradrenaline levels  become lower and lower, to a point that could impact  basic bodily functions. The body compensates by increasing  its number of noradrenaline receptors so it can detect much smaller amounts  of noradrenaline. This increased sensitivity  to noradrenaline allows the body  to continue functioning normally\u2014 in fact, it becomes dependent on opioids  to maintain the new balance. When someone who is physically dependent  on opioids stops taking them abruptly, that balance is disrupted. Noradrenaline levels can increase  within a day of ceasing opioid use. But the body takes much longer  to get rid of all the extra noradrenaline receptors  it made. That means there\u2019s a period of time when the body is too sensitive  to noradrenaline. This oversensitivity causes  withdrawal symptoms, including muscle aches, stomach pains,  fever, and vomiting. Though temporary, opioid withdrawal  can be incredibly debilitating. In serious cases, someone in withdrawal  can be violently ill for days or even weeks. People who are addicted to opioids  aren't necessarily using the drugs to get high anymore,  but rather to avoid being sick. Many risk losing wages or even jobs  while in withdrawal, or may not have anyone to take care  of them during withdrawal. If someone goes back  to using opioids later, they can be at particularly high risk  for overdose, because what would have been a standard  dose while their tolerance was high, can now be lethal. Since 1980, accidental deaths  from opioid overdose have grown exponentially  in the United States, and opioid addictions have  also exploded around the world. While opioid painkiller prescriptions  are becoming more closely regulated, cases of overdose and addiction  are still increasing, especially among younger people. Many of the early cases of addiction  were middle-aged people who became addicted to painkillers  they had been prescribed, or received from friends  and family members with prescriptions. Today, young people are often introduced  to prescription opioid drugs in those ways but move on to heroin or illicit  synthetic opioids that are cheaper and easier to come by. Beyond tighter regulation  of opioid painkillers, what can we do to reverse the growing  rates of addiction and overdose? A drug called naloxone is currently  our best defense against overdose. Naloxone binds to opioid receptors  but doesn\u2019t activate them. It blocks other opioids  from binding to the receptors, and even knocks them off the receptors  to reverse an overdose. Opioid addiction  is rarely a stand-alone illness; frequently, people with opioid dependence  are also struggling with a mental health condition. There are both inpatient  and outpatient programs that combine medication, health services,  and psychotherapy. But many of these programs  are very expensive, and the more affordable options  can have long waiting lists. They also often require complete  detoxification from opioids before beginning treatment. Both the withdrawal period and the common  months-long stay in a facility can be impossible for people who risk  losing jobs and housing in that timeframe. Opioid maintenance programs aim  to address some of these obstacles and eliminate opioid abuse  using a combination of medication and behavior therapy. These programs avoid withdrawal symptoms  with drugs that bind to opioid receptors  but don\u2019t have the psychoactive effects of painkillers, heroin,  and other commonly abused opioids. Methadone and buprenorphine are the primary opioid maintenance  drugs available today, but doctors need a special waiver  to prescribe them\u2014 even though no specific training  or certification is required to prescribe  opioid painkillers. Buprenorphine can be so scarce that there\u2019s even  a growing black market for it. There\u2019s still a long way to go  with combating opioid addiction, but there are great resources  for making sense of the treatment options. If you or someone you know is struggling  with opioid use in the United States, the Department of Health  and Human Services operates a helpline: 800-662-4357 and a database of more than 14,000  substance abuse facilities in the US: www.hhs.gov/opioids",

        "video_sub_title": "well my name is John Fralick I'm a hand surgeon at panorama orthopaedics wrist fractures are a really common injury here in Colorado between the mountain biking and snowboarding and skiing and just the ice we get here it's very common for people to fall and break their wrist the management of these wrist fractures can be anywhere from a simple cast to requiring surgery so the wrist in general is a pretty complex area of our body in fact that's basically all I do is wrist and hand surgery if you end up and break your wrist one of the things that we look at most commonly is whether that fracture extends into the joint surface itself so if we look at a wrist and generally have two bones the radius and the ulna this one has been fixed you can see by the hardware that's present that's the white area now if the fracture line comes up into the joint surface that's the surface right here then those are a little bit more complex and those oftentimes will require surgery but not every time the ones that don't require surgery usually have a fracture line that comes right along here that is outside or what we call extra articular not involving the joint surface one of the most important of you to look at here on the radius is when we look at it on the side this is the palm and this is the back of the wrist is again we look at this joint surface and we're trying to look at this from the side and we want to know whether this joint surface looks almost like a U or Cup there that's holding the rest of the bones but commonly what will happen is this joint area will actually be depressed or tilted backwards and that's an indication that we need to go in there and fix that with surgery otherwise the overall alignment of your wrist won't be maintained well and your higher risk for developing pain discomfort in arthritis down the way if it's broken we'll talk about the pros and cons of operative versus non operative intervention based on the pattern of the fracture we'll go over that together and if we say decided we're not going to do surgery for this may be better off being treated in a cast that typically looks at about six weeks of immobilization during that time you'll come in a couple more times usually about once every two weeks take the cast off get new x-rays to make sure everything's feeling well after you've gone through about six weeks of casting then we convert you to a removable brace and start you working on some exercises now some patients require some therapy afterwards each person's body kind of dictates who's gonna need the therapy who's not let's say that we end up and discussed your fracture and we decide that you'd be better off with surgical intervention what that entails is an outpatient procedure that takes about an hour and a half to do the surgery itself often times will give you an Associated block that makes the whole arm go numb and as well as we'll be number several hours afterwards to help with pain control in general it's gonna be about six weeks so we're gonna do limited of nothing more than about five pounds to that to that hand as far as activities of pushing pulling gripping or grasping depending on how complex the fracture is sometimes we'll put you into a cast for a couple weeks after surgeries other times we'll get you into removable brace and get you working with therapy and get trying to get your motion back as soon as we can some of the most common questions that I get are related around the recovery from a disarray is fracture but it's help all patients is that in general it's six weeks for the bone to heal three months for you to get your strength back and six months for you to kind of forget about the injury and that's whether we do surgery or not initially after the injury it's gonna be fairly painful and we do give you some medications to help with that but we try to get you off any narcotic pain medications as soon as we can and just get you transitioned over to an IV pro from there no title no well the other things that comes up as people ask about getting back to activities such as yoga or snowboarding mountain climbing or anything like that and generally I tell patients our goal here is to get you back to doing everything you're doing prior to the surgery another important question that people ask is what is to expect with range of motion one of the things we look at immediately post injury is kind of the amount of motion you have whether we're managing this operative or non-operative whether you be a candidate for therapy and the goal is to get you back to basically the exact same amount of motion prior to your injury to allow you to get back to all the activities that you want to get back to do we are happy to see you at any time if you have a fall or injury on to your wrist you're having persistent pain or discomfort there will come right in and we can get to a set of x-rays for you and evaluate whether or not it's broken you",

        "video_title": "How To Remove A Chest Tube",
        "video_sub_title": "today I'm going to demonstrate the proper way to remove a chest tube now there are a few things that you need to think about before you do this first make sure that you have all the equipment that you need on hand that includes a suture removal set in case the chest tube is sutured into place and then all of the dressing materials four-by-fours tape Vaseline gauze that you like for the dressing that you choose to apply the next thing to do is to make sure that you're properly dressed because these things do tend to splash a little bit so it's important to be gloved have your gown on and preferably a mask and eye shields as well just in case there's any splashing to your face now let me just go through the way I've set up the equipment here and now this is obviously a mannequin and the chest tube as you are getting ready should be connected to the chest tube collection system now the things that you'll need are tape obviously and I like to have these pre-cut before I apply it I don't like to be sitting there holding a dressing in place and trying to tear tape or having somebody else do that the four-by-four that will be the basis for your dressing some Vaseline gauze and what I like to do in advance is to actually prepare the dressing as much as I can so I'm going to actually wad up a little bit of a saline gauze right here in the middle and I'm actually going to take one piece of the tape that I've got and I'm going to stick the gauze onto it so that it's all ready to go and then I have the other two pieces nearby once you've done that you can explain to the patient what you're going to do because if they don't cooperate it makes it makes it much more difficult so just explain that it really doesn't hurt it does feel strange as it comes out it only takes a second or two to do it and tell them that you will have them hold their breath and bare down at a certain point which is very important the goal is to try to pull the tube out and get it out before any air can go back in so what you want to do is increase the pressure inside of the chest and this is most easily done in a patient who is not ventilated by just having them hold their breath and try to expire - closed glottis the good old valsalva maneuver if they are vented at the time then what you can do is have the respiratory therapist do an inspiratory pause so that the intrathoracic pressure is high at the time that the tube is pulled this makes sure that any residual air in the chest will also have an opportunity to come out so let's go back to our patient here and we've got the old dressing off we've explained everything to them so that they're all set and we have our supplies already at this point so now the only thing holding the tube in really is the existing suture so what I'll do is cut the suture and you have to then from that point onwards make sure that the chest tube is being supported by your hand so it's not going to come out take your dressing materials and what I like to do is to actually get it all ready so that I've got it right on the patient ready to go held in place and then as and I tell the patient get ready hold your breath bear down and as soon as they do that I pull and seal so now I have the dressing in place I've got the first tape strip all ready to go and then I can grab the other tape strips that I have available here one for the bottom part one for the middle part now again this mannequin the tape doesn't stick very well it would on a real person very well so this is what we have so now to finish up the most important thing now is to tell the patient how to take care of this because if they're going to go home they're going to have this big bulky dressing in place our preference is to tell them to leave it in place for 48 hours don't get it wet if they do need to take shower or take a bath they can cover it with occlusive dressing 'he's like plastic and then at the end of the 48 hours they can take it off and just replace the existing material with it a simple band-aid will do and it is okay for them to get a wet shower bathe swim whatever they'd like to do at that point they should have a follow-up visit scheduled so that they can come back in and have the wound looked at and obviously if they have any difficulties if they complain of redness drainage they should be too to look for those items and then report them to the physician on a timely manner so that if any type of infection develops we can take care of it that's it for removing a chest tube it's a relatively simple procedure it's very very quick but the important thing is you need to be prepared",

        "video_sub_title": "hello friends and welcome to this video today I'm gonna show you something that I learned when in my days of college that it was really useful to me and that is how to make a glass or a cup of four water or any liquids when you are on the go and all you have is a piece of paper as you know when you're in college you never carry a cup normally but they are all always many water fountains around and this is also useful in other places like the airport or any place where you find yourself needing a cup to drink and only all you have available is a sheet of paper so as you can see I have a white sheet of paper it's a common know sheet of paper and I'm just gonna show you how you will fold this and transform it into a drinking cup that will hold water and won't spill any water and will allow you to drink so let's just get started first of all you're gonna do what your first fold that it's like this you're gonna get this one of the extremes or what are the angles or corners of the paper and fold it all the way up making some sort of triangle so after you have that done you just have to be careful that it's aligned right here with the fixed side of the paper so this is the first fault it's very easy you see it's like a triangle I'm just gonna open it so you can see the fold again okay that's for number one now hole number two is you're gonna get this exceeds access you're gonna turn around the paper and fold it like this just show you to see they're gonna fold there like this always make sure that this angles here align so there you go just folder number two I'm going to show you to you again this is all there number two and for the number one so know whatever make one you first make a triangle for my only two you fold it like this now for the fault number three did you see the success you're gonna turn it around and fold the latest there you go so let's fold our normal tree now decide that this flap that you just fold it you're gonna go ahead and grab this angle or this corner and put it in this way so I'm gonna show you again we're going to put this corner and then move it all the way to this side you're gonna make like a perfect another kind of triangle with you if you will you can also see it like this and then you're gonna fold it so again this would be the next fold there another fold it's the same you wanna do the same with the other side and fold it like this be careful that this extreme here of the paper touches the end there you go so that's it so remember this just last two folds is you first you fold this in a flap then you fold this on this way and then you fold this on this way once that is done you see it will remain like this this is gonna be smooth and this would be what the folders are all located now you put it to the side you will see that you put your finger here and you can divide it it's like an opening here so on these lips or except flaps just go ahead and fold them just one and two that's it you will have created your glass now the cool thing is that to open the glass all you have to do is put your finger here in the middle put your hand like this so you open the glass and you have a perfect cup look at that isn't that neat I'm just going to make it close up so you can see that it's really perfectly easy to hold it's almost made to behold and if I open it here so you can see the interior you see the paper covers everywhere and this is the bottom you see you you can see my fingers and the doubt is list to the test I have here some water in a normal glass and I'm gonna prove to you that this paper cup that we just made will hold the water perfectly so I'm just going to go ahead and I'm gonna get the glass and throw it here I have drawn all the glasses that I had any water into the paper class as you can see is holding perfectly there is no it's the water there is no excess or no water spilling from the cup at all and the cool thing about it is that you can put your lips here and this is kind of rounded so it's perfect it's like a cup so that's all for today's video of course try to drink as soon as possible because it won't last for long and don't try don't fill the cup too much because it will spill eventually thank you for watching and I hope you enjoyed this video",

the eye changes in your vision and/or excessive tearing while wearing your scleral lenses remove your lenses immediately and contact your eye care practitioner the application and removal of your sclera lenses can seem intimidating at first but if you follow these instructions the process can be quite simple let's get started proper hygiene is the first step in successful lens care wash your hands thoroughly with a mild soap that doesn't contain moisturizers and dry them with a clean lint-free towel prior to handling your scleral contact lenses also keep your nails short filed and clean starting with the right lens carefully remove your scleral lens from the storage case by sliding it carefully out of the case ensure that your lens is clean clear of lint or debris and that your lens does not have any chips or cracks you can hold the lens up to the light to see if there are any deposits inside the lens bowl deposits may make the lens look white or cloudy even though your lenses may have different prescriptions they may look identical getting in the habit of working with the same lens first will help you to avoid mixing up your lenses prior to applying removing or caring for them rinse the lens with fresh preservative-free saline solution to remove any residual storage solutions that may have preservatives in them there are several ways to hold scleral lens for insertion the most common ways to hold the scleral lens for insertion are the tripod or three finger hold two finger hold or the difference DMV inserters [Music] fill the entire bowl of the lens with preservative free buffer free saline chemical free saline is necessary to keep the cornea healthy and comfortable since there's minimal fluid exchange under the lens after insertion it may be helpful to put a fixation dot on a mirror which is lying flat on the table position your head parallel with the countertop or table and look straight down what eyelids are difficult to hang on to so it's important to make sure both the lids and your finger are dry before you begin you will need to separate your eyelids in order to position the lens on the eye this can be accomplished by using your free hand to pull the upper lid and the ring finger of the hands with the lens on it to pull away the bottom lid don't release the lids until the lens is actually fully in place and your fingers and plunger have been removed slowly move the lens toward the eye gently apply the lens directly on the eye and over your pupil release the lids and blink several times to clear the excess fluid the lens will automatically Center if you notice an air bubble trapped underneath the lens you will need to remove the lens and reapply it [Music] applying your scleral lens using a DMV scleral you may use a special device called a DMV scleral to support the lens for application if desired however you should consult with your eye care practitioner prior to applying your scleral lenses with the DMV if it was not prescribed at your lens dispensing office visit the application process with the DMV scleral starts by lightly squeezing the tapered handle so you can create a mild suction carefully place the scleral lens on the top of the DMV making sure it is centered when the lens is centered on the DMV stop squeezing the device this will create a suction and your scleral lens should be securely positioned on the DMV completely fill the bowl of the scleral lens with a preservative free saline position your head parallel with a countertop or table and look straight down to apply your scleral lens you will need to separate your eyelids in order to position the lens on the eye this can be accomplished by using the index finger of your free hand to pull up your eyelid while using your middle finger to pull your bottom lid down slowly move the lens toward the eye gently apply the lens directly on the eye and over your pupil once the lens is on the eye a light squeeze of the tapered handle will release the lens from the DMV release the lids and blink several times to clear the excess fluid the lens will automatically Center if you notice an air bubble trapped underneath the lens you will need to remove the lens and reapply it wash the DMV frequently in warm soap water and let air dry removing your skull lenses with the DMV the DMV keeps the fingers out of the line of sight while removing the scleral lens it is very important to know where the scleral lens is located in the eye remember to develop a routine always start with the same lens begin by looking straight ahead at the mirror take the index finger and press the lower lid into the white of the eye just below the lens when the suction is broken a bubble will be present under the lens the lens is now ready to be removed with the DMV looking in the mirror pull your lower lid away from your cornea to expose the lower edge of the lens bring the DMB to the lower third of the lens once the DMV is adhered to the scleral lens gently pull the lens away from the eye with the lens resting on the DMV gently pinch the edge of the DMV to release the suction do not pull directly on the lens applying your sclera lenses may be a little tricky at first but all it takes is a little practice to become an expert however there is another element to scleral lens wear that is even more important for your success once your contact lenses have been removed they need to be cleaned to remove mucus protein and debris that builds up on the lens surface of the contact lens during the day your eye care practitioner will review the proper lens care solution for cleaning rinsing and disinfecting your sclera contact lenses place the scleral lens on the palm of your hands and place three to four drops of the cleaning solution recommended by your eye care practitioner removing this buildup will not only make it easier for you to see clearly through the lenses it will also make them more comfortable after putting these jobs on the lens gently rub the lens in a back and forth motion using your index finger rinse the cleaner off with an approved rinsing solution such as saline your scleral lens now needs to be stored the solution that fills the case is designed to wet and disinfect the lenses keeping your lenses comfortable and safe wash the DMV frequently in warm soapy water and let air dry having a backup sterile lens will eliminate any unforeseen circumstances by losing or breaking a lens more importantly your vision will be uninterrupted talk to your eye care practitioner about the importance of having a backup or spare set of Sparrow lenses please consult with your eye care practitioner with questions about your lenses thank you",

        "video_title": "What happens when you get heat stroke? - Douglas J. Casa",
        "video_sub_title": "In 1985, 16-year-old Douglas Casa, ran the championship 10,000 meter track race at the Empire State Games. Suddenly, with just 200 meters to go, he collapsed, got back up and then collapsed again on the final straightaway, with his body temperature  at dangerous levels. He had suffered an exertional heat stroke. Fortunately, with immediate and proper treatment, he survived the potentially fatal episode and has since helped save 167 people in similar circumstances. From ancient soldiers on the battlefield to modern day warriors on the gridiron, exertional heat stroke, or sunstroke,  has long been a serious concern. And unlike classical heat stroke,  which affects vulnerable people such as infants and the elderly  during heat waves, exertional heat stroke is caused by  intense exercise in the heat, and is one of the top three killers of athletes and soldiers in training. When you exercise,  nearly 80% of the energy you use is transformed into heat. In normal circumstances,  this is what's known as compensable heat stress. And your body can dissipate the heat as quickly as it's generated through cooling methods  like the evaporation of sweat. But with uncompensable heat stress, your body is unable to lose enough heat due to overexertion or  high temperatures in humidity, which raises your core temperature  beyond normal levels. This causes the proteins and  cell membranes to denature, creating cells that no longer  function properly and begin to leak their contents. If these leaky cells  proliferate through the body, the results can be devastating. Including liver damage,  blood clot formation in the kidneys, damage to the gastrointestinal tract  and even the failure of vital organs. So how do you diagnose  an exertional heat stroke? The main criterion is a core body temperature  greater than 40 degrees Celsius observed along with physical symptoms such as increased heart rate,  low blood pressure and rapid breathing or signs of central nervous system disfunction such as confused behavior,  aggression or loss of consciousness. The most feasible and accurate way  to assess core body temperature is with a rectal thermometer as other common temperature-taking methods are not accurate in these circumstances. As far as treatment goes, the most important thing to remember is cool first, transport second. Because the human body can withstand  a core temperature above 40 degrees Celsius for about 30 minutes before cell damage sets in, it's essential to initiate rapid cooling on site in order to lower it as quickly as possible. After any athletic or protective gear  has been removed from the victim, place them in an ice water tub  while stirring the water and monitoring vitals continuously. If this is not possible, dousing in ice water and applying  wet towels over the entire body can help. But before you start anything,  emergency services should be called. As you wait, it's important  to keep the victim calm while cooling as much  surface area as possible until emergency personnel arrive. If medical staff are available on site, cooling should continue until a core temperature of 38.9 degrees Celsius is reached. The sun is known for giving life, but it can also take life away if we're not careful, even affecting the strongest among us. As Dr. JJ Levick wrote of exertional heat stroke in 1859, \"It strikes down its victim  with his full armor on. Youth, health and strength oppose no obstacle to its power.\" But although this condition is one of the  top three leading causes of death in sports, it has been 100% survivable with proper care.",

        "video_title": "6 Steps to Relieve a Headaches & Fix Neck Pain |  Migraines, Stiff Neck",
        "video_sub_title": "welcome back everyone today I'm going to show you some massage techniques for the posterior and neck muscles these muscles can get quite tight if you spend a lot of time in a sitting position where you hold your head forward like so also known as a forward head carriage and being in a forward head carriage there'll be a lot of stress and strain in the cervical spine where the muscles will have to conversate and hold your head up and get quite tense and therefore squeezing on sensitive structures for example the greater occipital nerve where runs from the back of the neck into the base of the skull and radiating pain back into the head replicating headaches and migraines all you need is a tennis ball or cricket ball I highly recommend you use a firm rubber massage ball I'll put a link in the description box below or where to get them I highly recommend these because I always have them in my gym bag just in case I only use them on other structures for example my legs or even my lower back I hope these techniques help you as much as they help me and my patients muscle stripping place the ball behind your head just under the base of your skull on a tender spot that you found and lean against the wall this is also known as the junction where your skull meets your cervical spine with this technique you are rolling the ball over the muscles under your skull not pivoting the head over the ball just do this in a slow and controlled manner for one to two minutes and repeat this on both sides four to five times the main upper neck muscles in this area are the semies Barnardo's capitis the splenius capitis the sub occiput muscles and some of the attachments of the upper trapezius all these muscles help operate the neck with extension and rotation so sometimes when you turn your head you may feel pain in the neck or shoulders or even pain radiating to your eyes is usually due to muscle injuries or spasming in these muscles if you feel like you need to have a bit more pressure with this massage just step away from the ball about one to two feet away and allow your body weight to press up against the wall onto your neck instead of leaning your whole body against the wall this technique will mainly work on the general upper neck muscles where the muscles attach to the skull and will give you a lot of headache relief migraine relief and possibly allow you to relax a bit more sometimes when I can't fall asleep and I get a bit frustrated I just hopped out of bed and work on these muscles and amazingly enough when I'm done working on these tight muscles I feel a lot more relaxed and ready to go back to sleep let me know in a comment section below if this works for you as well pivot side to side place the ball on the back of your head just under the base of the skull where you find a tender spot on the junction where your skull meets your cervical spine now with your chin tucked in lean against the ball onto the wall with your body weight and pivot your head over the ball from side to side in a nice and controlled manner you can help guide the ball the same place with your fingers this will allow the ball to stay in the specific part where you want to work on and not let the ball roll away into different areas just pivot on this area for about one to two minutes and repeat again on both sides four to five times if you find any other tender spots please repeat the same process and feel free to explore around this area and work on those muscles to add more pressure on this area to step away from the wall one to two feet and allow your body weight to press against the ball instead of your body against the wall and repeat the process if you still don't feel like that's enough pressure you can lay on the ground and place the ball on a tender spot between the junction and allow your body weight of your head to press against the back of the neck muscles on a firm massage ball please do not underestimate how heavy your head is some people's head can weigh up to eight to ten kilos so this massage can be quite painful especially you're now coupling to forces against this ball for body weight of your head and also your intention of pressing your head into the ball as well just be careful as it can cause more pain or even bruising in the back of a head where you can him and see nodding massage once again place the ball under the base of your skull on the junction where your skull meets the upper cervical spine on a tender spot that you found use your fingers to guide the ball to stay in the same position otherwise the ball might roll into other areas now with your head press the ball against the wall and pivot up and down this will work on the fibers of the muscles in this area in a longitudinal manner since most of the muscles here actually start from the base of the skull and run down the spine do this for one to two minutes and repeat the process on both sides for four to five times please feel free to explore any other type muscles or saw areas that can release and massage out once again if you don't feel like this is enough pressure you can do this technique by laying on the floor when you do it on the floor the weight of your head will be pressing against a massage ball with their attention of you pressing on it as well so two forces pressing onto the massage ball and releasing these tight muscles this technique is great to work on trigger points which refer pain into other areas of your face and your head or even down the shoulders very similar to the pivot technique since this massage technique is a lot more specific and it works at one point at a time I really loved the massage ball I always keep one in my gym bag or bring it on my travels because it's so versatile it allows me to work on all other areas on my body and not just the neck I'll leave a link in the description box below where to get one cervical para spinal massage to work on the cervical Paras panels which is the muscles that run along your spine and attaches to your shoulders and even down your lower back just place the massage ball on the mid neck these are the row of muscles they run on each side of your spine slightly to your left and right are the bony prominences or the back of your neck also known as the spinous processes please do not place the ball on the middle of your spine as this would be rolling on your spinous processes of your spine which will probably give you more pain and it's not helpful at all lean against the wall and roll up and down your spine by doing little quarter squats with slight bends in the knee what helps me target these muscles a little bit more easier is rotating my body about 45 to 30 degrees away from the wall so my shoulders are slightly off the wall but on the same side that I'm working on that shoulder will be touching the wall for example if I'm working on the right Paris finals I'll be leaning my right shoulder on the wall but my left shoulder will be off the wall do this for one to two minutes and repeat it on both sides four to five times you know if the ball rolls away slightly just place it again back where you started this is a form of longitudinal muscles tripping on the server course Paris finals at the moment this is the only way I know how to do this technique by rolling up and down against the wall so I can't advise doing it on the floor because when you lay on the floor you actually pivot to side to side and that becomes more cross fibre massage instead and the only way to actually isolate the longitudinal movement is literally rolling up against the wall instead if you know how to do self longitudinal muscles gripping please comment below and let me know how the second massage we'll be doing is cross-fiber therapy on the cervical paris finals just place the massage ball on the back of the neck on the muscle belly of the cervical paraspinal some people might call this the back straps once again the best way to target these cervical Paris finals is if you were to work on for example the right side of the cervical Paris finals you'll lean onto that side with your chin tucked in and your right short I'll be touching the floor or touching the wall and your left shoulder will be slightly off the wall or slightly off the floor that way the pressure will be all on the cervical Paris bar on the right side and vice versa now roll the ball over this muscle back and forth in a slow and controlled manner sometimes when this muscle is quite tight it can flick under the ball but that's perfectly normal just work on this muscle for one to two minutes and repeat this four to five times on both sides once again if you don't feel like this is enough pressure you can do this technique by laying on the floor when you lay on the floor the weight of your head will be pressing against the massage ball with the intention of you pressing against the wall as well so two forces pressing against this massage ball so just be mindful with this technique otherwise you can cause injury or bruising in the back of the neck and you can't see the bruising so you don't know how much injury you actually causing as well so you just be a bit mindful with this technique remember with the technique in particular he needed tucking your chin that creates the pressure on the back of the neck muscles just a quick disclaimer if you're feeling a lot more pain dizziness or even excruciating pain from this massager video to stop immediately and see a professional there's no point of gambling with videos on the internet to self help yourself but if you get relief that's great comment below and let me know which massage has helped you and another thing I like to throw in as well is please do not massage from the front of the neck there's a lot of Vernal structures in the front for example a jugular vein the carotid artery obviously your windpipe and esophagus we don't want to damage these vulnerable structures and they can be quite dangerous when you injure them so definitely don't massage from the front of the neck once again thanks for watching I highly recommend you join my VIP Facebook group I want to build a community there where you can ask questions and I can answer them and we can help each other out now if you liked this video and you found

        "video_sub_title": "Hello! In this tutorial I'll show you how to make the design of a flower, which is often used in nail art. I've added a shade off with a sponge to make a melted French manicure effect. Let\u2019s have a look at the video which is more useful than my introduction for sure. After I've applied a fuchsia pink base. I use a glittering nail polish and a sponge I dip the sponge in the glitter nail polish and I apply it at the bottom of my nail for a French manicure effect. To shade off the color, move upward little by little and by press less and less Then to enhance the glitter effect, I use a silver glitter nail polish. And I shade off once again over the first layer. Then I use black acrylic paint and a detail brush. You can either use a detail brush or a liner brush Then I draw three or four petals, it depends on the length of your nail I've chosen the black color purposively. So that it doesn\u2019t strike too much attention and for a melted effect over the glittering nail polish. And to make it as though it was a sort of French manicure . When I\u2019m done, I add some flames on the side To do so, I press the brush and take off the pressure. In order not to make lines of the same width. Then I dilute my paint in water as much as possible And draw some very thin lines inside the petals To bring some colors to the petals. Finally, with a dotting tool I add some little dots with white acrylic paint. That\u2019s it! I hope you enjoyed this tutorial. All the products used for this nail art are found in the description.

        "video_title": "How To Fix Lumbar Lordosis and Anterior Pelvic Tilts - Full Exercise and Stretch Plan!",
        "video_sub_title": "hello and welcome to UK fitness up my name is Travis Terran and today we're going to be covering absolutely everything that you need to know about anterior pelvic tilts how to fix them and what causes them let's get into it [Music] okay so let's get straight into it so anterior pelvic tilts what does this mean what what is an anterior pelvic tilt so anterior means forward pelvic means your pelvis which is in your hips and tilt means to tilt forward in this case because we're tilting anteriorly so what that would look like in a typical client is I want you to think of the hips as being something that should be nice and straight okay so the hip should be nice and solid and straight somebody that's got anterior pelvic tilt is actually gonna be tipped forward so tipped anteriorly now this causes this to happen okay now nobody's going to walk around with a straight back like this okay what they're gonna do is they're gonna hyper extend the back to come up to our level and to be able to see properly the problem with that is somebody that is naturally tilted and walking around and doing everyday activities with that excessive curvature in the spine that excessive lumbar lordosis they're gonna have a lot of pain in the lower back and that can cause compression it can cause the muscles around the lower back to tighten up and seize up it's also going to cause a load of other problems that we're going to get into when it comes into your corrective exercises some but not all the causes for anterior pelvic tilts are poor posture obesity lack of exercise and spinal conditions now let's go a little bit into those before we cover our corrective exercise poor posture is one of the most common causes of an anterior pelvic tilt when the body is in a seated position for too long muscles in the hip starts become sure and they start to adapt to that short position because they're spending so much time in that position obesity results in the presence of excess fat in the body now this can be stored in the abdomen and buttocks this puts extra strain on the lower back which may cause the lumbar spine to bend this entail can be another reason why we can perform that anterior pelvic tilt in addition to increase in the risk of obesity a lack of exercise can weaken the core muscles that sit around the trunk and pelvis weak muscles are less able to support the spinal column allowing the spine to curve excessively we can form an anterior pelvic tilt as part of an underlining spinal condition so conditions such as kyphosis spondylosis and diocese's can cause an anterior pelvic tilt so it doesn't have to always be something that we've been doing or not been doing that causes an anterior pelvic tilt so now we know what caused Nancy Rhea pelvic tilt how do we fix it so what I want you see for the first stretch is but the soles your feet together hands out and I want you to reach as far as you can and try and get as much of a stretch in the lower back as possible now this is going to take out the hip flexors as much as possible and when you're in this position if you're at a place like work and you you can't actually what you don't want to get on the floor you can do this seated so try and touch the floor seated if you can't no problem try and do that in the future and if you can you can actually make it a little bit more abrasive by going further in addition to stretching out the back we also need to stretch out the hip flexor muscles so in this stretch I'm doing a kneeling hip flexor stretch now my right knees at a 90 degree angle my left knees on the floor I'm squeezing my glutes and core isn't much it's physically possible and there is a way if you don't feel this one to increase the stretch so from this angle you're about to see I put my hand up in the air and I'm side flexing so trying to bend my trunk to my right hand side and this will increase the stretch now our next stretch is a chair hip flexor stretch well this is really really abrasive so if you can't do the first one we just saw then certainly leave this for a little while this is really quite excruciating and prizes those hip flexors open stretches mainly the iliopsoas muscle so it is a great stretch but really be cautious with when you choose to do this one make sure you progress through the previous one first so the first of your corrective exercises is a dead buck now the dead bug involves lying face-up on a map with your arms in the air above your torso and your legs in the air with your knees bent at a 90 degree angle then you lower each opposite arm and opposite leg towards the floor in a slow and controlled fashion trying to keep your lower back on the mat and return to Center and repeat on the other side now the next corrective exercise can be really tricky so this is called an arc AC plank start in a plank position up on your toes body straight resting on your elbows at 90 degrees push upwards with your upper back pushing your shoulder blades away from the floor and then breathing out squeeze your quads and glutes as hard as you can whilst you hold this position keep them squeezed and hold that tense position for as long as possible try and feel like you're trying to tuck your bum in as you do this moving on to our next exercise which is a pelvic tilt lie on your back with your knees bent and the cells your feet on the floor allow yourself to come into a neutral position and you might find with an anterior pelvic tilt your back comes off the floor this is absolutely fine try and exhale as much is physically possible and rock your hips towards your head now I'm demonstrating here in the video the rotational pattern in which I want you to rotate so I want you to try and rotate posteriorly so try and rotate back and up if you found all of those way too easy then we can progress on to yoga ball planks so I want you to try and get the yoga ball an arm's length away and then what you do is you pop your hands in the same position really that you would as a plank and allow the ball to roll onto your forearm now if you want to make this harder you can actually pause when you come out so maybe to a two or three second pause and it's a really good way to actually develop some shoulder stability at the same time but it should be said that you should only progress on to this one once you can do the others and this is seen as a harder exercise let's talk about how the shrimp fill up those glute muscles so the next one is a glute bridge lie on your back with your knees bent hip-distance apart and your feet flat on the floor as you drive up try to squeeze the glutes as hard as you can and remember to keep your core engaged throughout the exercise no point in this exercise should you be feeling any lower back pay you know anything in the lower back really try and focus on driving with the glutes and core and lowering under control the next exercise is a hip thrust now you can see in the demonstration I'm doing here that I've got my hands on my hips and that's quite a natural position for me because I generally do this with a barbell I will refer a beginner you might want to put your arms in a tee position and that will allow for greater stability when you're doing this exercise exactly the same as your previous glute bridge exercise you want to be feeling this in the glutes and hamstrings brace your core as you do the movement and try to do it slow and steady and under control well all the time when I see patients with anterior pelvic tilts they've got tight hamstrings they're accompanied with this now from a time savings perspective it's nice to throw these single leg variations of hamstring curls in see this is more of an optional exercise it's not a must however if you're doing this as part of a routine in the gym it's good to throw in now it's quite easy to know how to progress when you are in a gym and you've got a gym membership you can always use a weight or a barbell but if you're at home be creative so use bags or books or anything that's gonna add a little bit of weight to your exercise we can also be really out the box and creative and do exercises like on the screen now which is a yoga ball hamstring curl and to do a yoga ball hamstring curl we want to have our heels on the ball we want to dig in until our torso is up off the floor brace the core and then bring the heels in and you would certainly feel this very quickly finally I want to bring your attention to the diagram on screen and it shows really the common problems that you would have if you had an anterior pelvic tilt which is tightness in the erector spinae muscles tightness in the hip flexors and we can inhibit it gluts and abdominal muscles now everything we've done in our corrective exercises is to fix all of those four air however if the takeaway can be anything from this video I want you to think if you are somebody that goes to the gym and you're trying to build a functional physique whether you're a runner a weightlifter or whatever you have to start off with a really solid foundation and that can only come with strong glue and strong core muscles so try and base everything from there moving forward so that concludes today's video on anterior pelvic tilts and what lumber lordosis is now if you're somebody that would like workout programs on this so you're a beginner intermediate advanced or you would like a workout plan they're not only Kate's with caters for a beginner but also tells you what to advance on to and when to stop and all the frequently asked questions I get about this download my PDF file that's on my website it talks about this topic in way more detail than we've done today but I've highlighted some of the things that can kick-start you and rehabilitating yourself and trying to get those hips back in line thank you very much for watching today's video I've been Travis and I'll see you soon",

        "video_sub_title": "Cankles, that is, the ankle looks thick often will make the legs appear very thick and bulky  In fact, this girl's legs and upper body are very slim On the contrary, if the ankle is slim, it will make you look much slimmer  The main reasons for cankles include the following  First, accumulation of fat It will thin down doing whole body fat burn workouts  Then, there are cankles caused by different problems which include, first, edema legs the ankle is thin when you get up in the morning but the legs and ankles become thick in the evening The second problem is the lack of stability of ankles The third problem is the anteriorly shifted talus This can also be associated with limited ankle joint dorsiflexion Fourthly, inadequate arch and forefoot function  such as flat feet and weak toes   Lastly, over-tension of some muscles and fascia  will also affect the visual line of ankles  These acquired factors not only make ankles look less pretty  but also affect our health Fortunately, these problems can be improved through exercise I have previously shared a workout for slimming the calves  and one of the movements to increase the flexibility and stability of the ankle is ankle rotation A friend said that she only did this movement for 20 days You can see the result of her here Today's exercises were designed specifically to target those problems mentioned above Let's get started now First, let's do Single Leg Standing Your toes, soles, legs, and hips should work together  to keep your body balanced It's best to do this barefoot Because you can better exercise and use your feet and toes Inadequate arch and forefoot function such as flat feet and a lack of power in your toes when standing can affect the alignment of your ankles and calves Okay, now close your eyes Stand on one leg for 15 seconds Level up, keep going, everyone! Good, open your eyes, switch to the other leg and do the same This exercise is a great way to stabilize your ankles train your feet, and activate your hip muscles Alright, close your eyes and hold for 15 seconds Make sure to use both the soles and your hips Ok, the next move is Tiptoes walking This movement can exercise the arch and forefoot and also increase the stability of the ankles At the same time, when our heels lifted off the ground the calf muscles are contracted which can improve the circumfluence of lower body's' blood And thus improve edema leg and prevent varicosity When the toes touch the ground make sure the entire big toe is in touch with the ground Do not just land on the outside of the forefoot All right, the third movement is Holding Ball Jump The reason to clip a ball between your ankles is to ensure that the ankles are stable during jumps  If you don't have a ball like this you can also use any other soft object with a certain volume instead If you don't like jumping you can also do standing on tiptoes instead as shown on the right side This action can strengthen the function of the soles of your feet improve flat feet, exercise calves and increase ankle stability Okay, let's take a break Then we're going to do Bridge with Heel Raise Lie flat on the ground so that your fingers touch your heels  and then do hip bridge Notice that when your hips are lifted off the ground  your heels are lifted too, only your toes are touching the ground Then slowly lower your heels and lift again, and repeat Be sure to keep your hips still throughout the process, don't drop them  only your feet are moving Feel the tension around your front feet and ankle  This exercise can also evolve into another one that is very convenient to do in our daily life That is sitting on a chair and lift up the heels You can also add some weight to the knees Everyone can do it at any time when you are working or studying You should feel your feet are very sore now That's right, that means this exercise is working So we must hang on, keep going!  All right, 30 seconds is up Now let's do a static version of the bridge Keep the heels off the ground The pelvis should be in line with the thigh and upper body Hold this position for 15 seconds Good, next raise your legs up, and bend your ankles up and down  Make sure you bend your ankles as far as you can with full effort Stay for a few seconds and restore This action can increase the flexibility of our ankles If the angle when you bend your ankles down is very small  that is, limited dorsiflexion of the foot Not only will your ankles be thick but it will also cause compensation of the knee and hip joints For example, you can't do a full squat down This not only can't train the parts you want it will also cause knee pain, lower back pain Your foot and the front of your calf should feel sore now But let's hang in there and keep going! Okay, don't stop yet, let's speed it up now You should still bend hard despite the faster speed and do every bending to the maximum limit  It will be over in a few seconds Please hold on and do each action properly, let's go! Okay, next, let's do Inversion of Foot Move your toes inward toward each other horizontally while keeping your legs still You can put your hands on your knees to make sure legs are still  This movement can also increase ankle flexibility Ankles must be both stable and flexible in order to be a health ankle and to have a beautiful shape and line Everyone hang in there!  We have finished more than half of today's exercises  Only two more to go!  Let's go! All right, let's take a break Then we're going to do some stretching to improve the dorsiflexion of the foot One of the causes of restricted foot dorsiflexion is the anteriorly shifted talus that blocks the ankle joint We can press on the talus with our hands Our heels firmly touch the ground And push our knees forward as far as possible If you have an elastic band Fix one end and the other end can be wrapped around the talus   Put your foot on a higher place like a chair and do the same movement This will have a better effect Okay, switch to the other side and stretch in the same way Note that when the knee is pushed forward the heel should keep touching the ground, do not leave the ground This action can improve the flexibility of the ankle Okay, next we're going to do Downward Dog Lift your heels alternatively  Open up your shoulders  so your ears can go beyond your arms and go further  Another reason for insufficient ankle flexibility is  excessive tension in muscles and fascia of the calves and the soles  Downward facing dog is a great way to improve these problems as well as improve foot dorsiflexion Now keep your legs straight and heels on the ground Alright, let's stretch the arch a little more like this In order to have healthy ankles and calves it is important to have strong soles Ok, if you don't have a foam roller at home you are done with today's exercise then If you have a foam roller, please follow me to complete the following exercises We use the foam roller to massage the back of your calves as well as the middle, inside and outside of the ankle Especially the inside must be massaged well This is the tibialis posterior muscle which is important for maintaining a normal arch and ankle stability Also, here is a very important Acupuncture point for women, that is San Yin Jiao (SP 6) If there is no obvious massage feeling you can also cross your legs so that the pressure is greater and the results will be better All right, let's roll over Massage the middle, inside, and outside of the front of the calves You can do the same thing  and massage the other leg in the same way Finally, place your foot on the foam roller like this and sit your butt on the heels Use the weight of your body to reposition your ankles All right, that's the exercise for today I'm April, and see you in my next video  Bye",

        "video_title": "How to Soothe a Sore and Irritated Nose After Frequent Blowing",
        "video_sub_title": "how to soothe a sore and irritated nose after frequent blowing apply a soothing moisturizer to the outside of your nostrils petroleum jellies like Vaseline and ointments like neosporin work best place a small amount of the product on a q-tip then apply it around the entrance of each nostril the extra moisture will not only relieve dryness but will also create a barrier against irritation from a runny nose if you don't have something like Vaseline or neosporin handy you can use your regular facial lotion it won't lock in moisture as effectively but it should still provide some relief by tissue with lotion if you're willing to pay a slightly higher price splurging on some high-quality facial tissue can go a long way towards soothing your nose look for products that have been treated with lotion they do less damage as you're blowing your nose and counteract the irritation with their soothing lotion less chafing during nose blowing means less irritation in the long run soak your nose with a moist washcloth if your nose is badly chafed or even bleeding add warm moisture quickly to relieve the pain run a clean washcloth under hot water then gently press it into the nostrils tilt your head back and leave the washcloth in place until it cools back down to room temperature breathe through your mouth during this time apply petroleum jelly or neosporin to your nose immediately after soaking your nose with a washcloth either dispose of the washcloth or wash it immediately reduce your nose blowing a runny or congested nose can feel terrible and you may be tempted to blow your nose constantly though it may be hard fight that urge especially if you're home alone and there's nobody to judge you blow your nose only when necessary if a little mucus runs out of your nose gently dab it away instead of honking on a dry tissue and irritating your nose use gentle nose blowing technique instead of taking a deep breath and blowing as hard as you can blow gently to reduce chafing blow softly through one nostril then the other continue alternating nostrils until you feel your nose is clear enough always loosen the mucus with a deck injesting technique before blowing your nose seek medical treatment for allergies a doctor will be able to prescribe allergy medications that can control your reaction whether you get allergy shots or take flonase nasal spray when your nose starts running treating the underlying allergy will help soothe your nose note that oral decongestants tend to make your mucus even drier increasing irritation Dec ingesting your nose loosen your nasal secretions there are many methods you can use to liquefy and loosen the secretions blocking up your nose by setting aside a little time for these techniques you can improve the efficiency of each nose blowing over time you'll have to blow your nose less frequently decreasing the chafing on your nose try these decongestant techniques throughout the day and always blow your nose immediately afterward sit in a steaming room if you belong to a gym with a sauna that's the perfect place to both loosen nasal congestion and relax after a long day but if you don't have access to a sauna you can improvise in your bathroom turn on the hot water in the shower and close the door to keep all the steam in stay in the bathroom for three to five minutes or until you feel the secretions are loose and moist gently blow your nose before leaving the steamed room to save water you can just blow your nose when you get out of the shower apply a warm compress to the bridge of the nose take a moist washcloth and place it in the microwave until it's warm but not burning hot microwaving time will vary depending on your machine so start with 30 seconds and add 15 seconds at a time the washcloth should be hot but tolerable place the cloth across your nose and allowed to sit until the heat is gone the heat should loosen secretions even when applied from outside the nasal cavity repeat the process if necessary before blowing your nose irrigate your nose with saline spray this just means you will flush your nasal passage with a saline spray you can buy a nasal saline spray at any grocery store or pharmacy spray the bottle twice into each nostril adding liquid to the secretions and liquefying them if you don't want to buy a saline spray you can make a simple one at home mix eight ounces of warm water with one half teaspoon of salt by a suction bulb from the grocery store or pharmacy use it to irrigate your nostrils with your homemade saline rinse try using an IDI pot an IDI pot looks like a miniature tea pot it clears out blocked sinus passages in the nose by flooding warm water through one nostril and out the other heat the water to at least 120 degrees Fahrenheit 49 degrees Celsius to kill anything potentially harmful in the water allow the water to cool to a comfortable temperature before using the needy pot tilt your head and pour water into your right nostril if you keep your head tilted it will drain out your left nostril consider skipping the needy pot if you live in an area with inadequate water treatment there have been some reports of rare amoeba confections from parasites in tap water drink warm tea throughout the day the throat and nose are closely connected so drinking warm liquids will also warm up the nasal passage just like inhaling steam this will allow secretions to flow more freely any type of tea you prefer is fine but you may choose to drink a healing herbal tea if you have a cold check your grocery store or health store for cold or flu teas peppermint and clove teas can soothe a sore throat while freeing up your nose exercise if your health allows it if you are bedridden with a cold or flu you should absolutely get some rest but if your excessive nose-blowing is caused by allergies exercising is a good option when your heart rate rises enough to make you break a sweat it has a beneficial side effect of clearing your nasal secretions even 15 minutes of exercise can help as long as you avoid the allergen for example if you're allergic to pollen don't go running outdoors eat something very spicy think about the last time you ate something uncomfortably spicy do you remember how your nose started running that's the ideal state for nose blowing so power your way through hot salsa peppers hot wings anything to get your nose running blow your nose immediately while the secretions are still moist and fluid invest in a humidifier you can buy a humidifier at the drugstore to keep the air moist as you sleep choose a humidifier with a cool mist setting as a warm mist might make congestion worse set the machine to the ideal humidity level between 45 and 50 percent a tabletop version holds one to four gallons of water and should be changed daily clean the water container completely by hand every three days the filter preferably a HEPA should be changed at the discretion of the manufacturer massage your sinus area massaging the areas that affect your sinus may open up your nasal passages and make it easier to blow your nose for a little extra punch use rosemary peppermint or lavender oil but make sure not to get it in your eyes you can rinse your face with a warm compress afterward using your index and middle fingers apply gentle pressure in a circular motion to the phorid frontal sinus the bridge of the nose and temples orbital sinus under the eyes maxillary sinus",

        "video_sub_title": "Poop: a window to your health and a valuable warning system of a problem inside your body. Keeping an eye on your poop is an important step in being aware of colorectal cancer and identifying early signs of the disease. Hi! I'm Dr. Shady Ashamalla, a surgeon who specializes in colorectal cancer. Because it involves bums and poop people often shy away from talking about colorectal cancer. I want to change that because the more we talk the more we know and the better we can find colorectal cancers early. The colon takes in water and nutrients from the food we eat and then passes the waste to the rectum and voila \u2014 poop. Colorectal cancer is when cancer cells begin to grow out of control in the colon or rectum, first forming a cluster of cells called a polyp, and eventually becoming a cancer as the cells burrow deeper and deeper into the wall of the colon. These polyps can cause changes in the frequency or shape of your poop. And because the polyps and eventual cancers are growing on the inner lining of the bowel, they can also bleed into the bowel and that blood then becomes incorporated with the stool as it passes through. So what does that blood in your poop actually look like? Blood in your poop can be caused by a variety of things but let's imagine what the blood in your poop might look like if it's coming from a colorectal cancer. First, let's say the cancer is on the right side of the colon. That's the beginning of this very long organ and the furthest from the exit, your anus. You probably wouldn't be able to see any blood coming from that cancer by the time it reaches the toilet. If there's lots of blood coming from a cancer on the right side of the colon though, it might not look red when it reaches the toilet because it's older blood. Instead, it might look more like black tar mixed with the poop. If the cancer is further down the colon or in the rectum the blood will be fresher, smeared along the stool as it hits the toilet or even mixed with the stool and still red. Finally, if the cancer is in the rectum, you might see red blood going directly into the toilet before or after the poop rather than mixed in with the stool. If you have a visual impairment or otherwise unable to visually check your poop, talk to your doctor about other important screening tests. Blood in your stool is a warning sign for cancer but it's not always visible. That's why it's so important for people to take part in colorectal cancer screening programs starting at the age of 50 or even sooner if you have a family history of the disease. Visible blood in your stool, hidden blood spotted through a screening test, or changes in your bowel habits can be caused by other health issues. But remember, regardless of the cause it's important to get it checked out. So before you flush, remember to always take a good look at your poop. It could save your life.",

        "video_title": "Concussion Headaches - Physiologic Headaches & How To Treat Them | Concussion Questions",
        "video_sub_title": "[Music] first off the first one we're going to talk about is what I'm gonna call physiologic this this one is related to potential blood flow impairment or potential dysfunction in the autonomic nervous system and the reason why I'm lumping this in here I'm not sure if this is an actual cause of headache but I do know that the treatment helps relieve headaches symptoms okay now whether or not that's a secondary thing or whether or not it's actually due to the improvement in the physiologic systems or the autonomic systems or the blood flow systems or whether or not it's due to kind of a secondary effect but nonetheless there's been a lot of research that's looked at exercise as a form of treatment for concussion and persistent concussion symptoms and generally the way this is done is you go to a clinician who has training and concussion they could administer what's called the buffalo concussion treadmill test with this test we gradually increase your rate of exertion to try and find out what your kind of braking point is and what we're looking for during that test is to try and find out not if you get symptoms because generally people doing this test have symptoms we're looking to find out what point the symptoms get worse because the treatment for these types of dysfunctions is exercise but if you're gonna get symptomatic at let's say a heart rate of 150 beats per minute well I don't want you exercising at 150 beats per minute every day because you're just gonna be flaring yourself up and making yourself worse so I want to find out what your breaking point is and I want to lower your heart rate threshold down so that you're actually working out at a rate that's safe that's not going to exacerbate things and make things worse and what you do is you do this exercise every single day that's what's called sub symptom threshold exercise lower than your threshold and you do this every day for a week or two and you come back in and we retest you after we retest you we can hopefully establish a higher threshold once we establish a higher threshold but now you're working a higher heart rate and again it's safe because we've established what the threshold is and we're staying below that threshold the goal however is to gradually work you up to a point where you can have full physical exertion with no increase in any of your symptoms at which point we can let you go and do whatever type of exercise activity you want to at the same time this is going on what you notice is that people's symptoms are rapidly decreasing once they get better blood flow more activity more you know exercise is good for all sorts of things like endorphins and sleep and inflammation and all these other things the symptoms of a concussion including headache start to drop so I'm not necessarily sure that when I call this physiologic headache that the headache itself is due to the blood flow abnormality that you have or the autonomic nervous system regulation issues but what I do know is that the treatment of sub symptom threshold exercise helps a lot of people with post concussion headaches now that could be due to the other things the inflammation reduction the better sleep the endorphin release etc right so we don't know if that is a cause effect relationship but we do know that the treatment is helpful you",

        "video_sub_title": "\u266a Bob and Brad, the two most famous \u266a \u266a Physical therapists on the Internet. \u266a - I am pumped, Brad. Hi Folks, I am Bob Schrupp, Physical Therapist. - Brad Heineck, Physical Therapist. - Together, we're the most famous physical therapists on the Internet. - In our opinion, of course, Bob. - Shoulder pain, question mark. Never sleep in these three positions. Do this instead. - Right, we're gonna show the appropriate way to do it, make yourself happy and more sleep. - More sleep? - More sleep if you do it the we say, well. - More sleepy? By the way, if you're new to our channel, please take a second to subscribe to us. We provide videos on how to stay healthy, fit, pain-free, and we upload every day. Also, you'll want to join us on our social medial channels and our website, because we're always giving something away, go to bobandbrad.com, go to the giveaway section, and what are we giving away Lonnie? Whoah! - Wow, good hands Bob! - Good hands, don't I? We got the Renfroe Massage Pillow. Now, Brad's gonna show it right here. This is pretty cool. This device is not very expensive, but yet you can use it to do the back and the neck, and you can even do your legs with it. - Right, it slides up and down on the seat, it has a Velcro strap if you choose, otherwise you can put it in the chair without that, and it's very nice, Bob. - Yeah, works very well. You can also join us on Bob and Brad on Facebook. It's pinned to the top of the page, the contest. Also, if you want a shorter version of us, if you're tired of us rambling on, go to Twitter or Instagram, we got a 60-second version of our show. - There you go, Bob. - All right, Brad, take it away. What are we talking about today? - Oh, I'll get, it feels good. - Oh. - Oh! Sorry, yeah, shoulder joint. Now the shoulder joint is a shallow socket, and it's sensitive when it does not stay in the joint and it's pushed off to the side, so pressure on the joint, especially when it's irritated for whatever reason is really gonna flare it up. - You can also get impingement at night if you sleep wrong. - Exactly right. - So one of the most common things that people do, and they don't do it on purpose, including myself, is they'll roll over on the shore, sore shoulder. - I knew you were gonna do that. I knew you were gonna say shore soulder. - (laughs) yeah, its a tongue twister. - (laughs) yeah. - And when that happens, the pressure goes on, oftentimes it puts it slightly out of position, pinches or cuts the circulation off. There's a number of things that can happen to cause pain. - You're right, Brad, I am amazed how prevalent it is. - Right. - I mean, people with sore shoulders, I ask them, you sleep on the shoulder? \"Yeah.\" - Does it hurt? \"Yeah, wake up and it...\" - \"Yeah, I wake up and it hurts.\" So, it's not healing then. - Right. - You know, it needs time to heal. - So, what is the option, and there is an option so you can sleep on that side you been sleeping on your whole life and you can't break your habit, and go ahead. - All right, here they come, number one. We'll go ahead and keep 'em rollin here, number two. Number three. Thank you, Lonnie, there you got it. - Invest in some pillows. - All right. - But, actually, for sleeping on your side, you don't need this many pillows. You do need. - A nice little throw pillow. - Right. Then use the pillow that you already have. - Right. You might use two. - Right. - Because you're on your side, and I do, I sleep like this every night, I eat my own cooking, as they say. - (laughs) right. - I create a canal here, and by creating the canal, now I'm taking the pressure more on my head and on my thoracic area rather than the shoulder. - Or kinda the ribcage. - Or kinda the ribcage, right. And, if you wanna, you can even roll back a little bit so you're a little more onto your back. - Sure. - And that'll even take more pressure off the shoulder. This really makes a big difference. - Right. - So if you feel like you just cannot get off that side. - Yeah, go down there again once, Bob. This is what I tell my patients, it makes more sense to me. You can either roll back or think about pulling that shoulder forward a little bit. It really does the same thing, but it's just two ways of looking at it. - Sure, gotcha. - Good, so we got the pillow canal if you're gonna sleep on the shore, uh, sore side. - What to do instead of sleeping on the shore side, sore side (laughs). Now you got me doing it! - (laughs loudly) it's killin' me. - (laughs loudly) oh my god! - Now, listen, lay down again, Bob. - On my back or? - No, same side. - Okay. - Let's say that now the opposite, let's say your left shoulder is the sore side. - This is the sore shoulder. - So, this shoulder is sore, and what we're going to do is say, this is not so good either because, what happens? - You don't want to sleep like this, because you're starting to internally rotate your shoulder. - Yep. - And this is how we actually test for impingement, and so you're actually impinging the shoulder when it's like this. A lot of people, when they have the shoulder that is sore, they actually put their arm up on here and let it just rest it here, but a good alternative, Brad, would be what? - Pillows. - Right. - You can use one, but two actually can work better. - Two works a lot better. - Mmmhmm. - Because you can put one here, and then you put one actually under the armpit and the arm itself. - Yeah. - And this is just a really comfortable thing. If you only have one, kind of this starts happening yet. Or, you know, you go like this and still you're kind of turned in yet, so you really need two, so. - Right, so, because that puts the arm in a neutral position and makes a big difference on the stress. And we're talking about, you might not notice it when you first lay down with that sore shoulder up, but after an hour, when your sleeping, and you got that stress on there, you wake up, ohhh! - By the way, Brad and I invested in pillow companies right before we started this program, so we want it to spike up. - (laughs) oh yeah, right. - All right, what's next Brad? - Oh, this is a big one, although we'll see, we don't want you laying on your stomach, and we're not a big promoter of stomach sleeping, but if you do and then you put your arms overhead. - Yeah. - This is probably pretty obvious for most people. Usually, people go like this, Bob - Sure. - There, but look at this. This is really gonna bother your shoulders. Or, lay on your back and lay with your arms over your head. - And, surprisingly, a lot of people do this. They fall asleep like, hands underneath the head. - Yep. - Or they even fall asleep like this. - Yep. Sometimes one arm, sometimes both. I had one patient, she couldn't get out of that habit, always slept arms up like that. - Oh did she really? - Yeah, and she didn't have shoulder pain for quite a while, and it was only one shoulder. - It reminds me of little babies, little babies sleep that way. - Well, they're flexible as can be aren't they? - Yeah. - So, how do you correct this? We're saying no sleeping on your stomach, sleep on your back, but even when you're sleeping on your back, once again you're gonna have your pillows, and if this is the shoulder that hurts, you can put one here. - I actually generally I only think one is needed for this, Brad. - Sure. - But, you could probably do two, you want to experiment, but if you get one under the arm like this, this is usually fairly comfortable already, but, yeah, give me another one. Why not? - It's one of those things that depends on the size of your pillow, what kind of pillow you have, one or two, but you're gonna know what's right because it's immediately gonna feel like, oh this is very comfortable on that sore shoulder. - Yeah, this is not something that, you know, you're gonna be guessing at because you'll know. - It's very clear. - It's very clear whether it's comfortable or not. - (sighs tiredly) - You know the thing is, when you're trying to heal an area, sleep is so important. - Mmhmm. - If you're not getting your sleep, it's not healing. - Right. - So let's stop putting the pressure on the shoulder. - Exactly, so. - Remember, Brad and I can fix just about anything. - Except for - A broken heart. - There you go, but we continue to persevere, and we will never stop working on that. We take little breaks now and then, but we continue on with it. - I worked on it last weekend. What'd you do? - I went fishing (laughs). - (laughs) All right, thanks for watching.",

        "video_title": "Head-to-Toe Assessment Nursing | Nursing Physical Health Assessment Exam Skills",
        "video_sub_title": "this is sarah with registerednessrn.com and in this video i'm going to be performing a nursing head-to-toe assessment this video will be similar to what you have performed in nursing school whenever you're doing your clinical check-off now whenever you actually start working as a nurse you'll be able to tailor this head to toe assessment to focus on the patient's needs and you'll get a lot faster at this so what i want to do is i want to cover literally how to assess from the hair on the head all the way down to the toes so let's get started now when you're doing your head to toe assessment you follow that sequence of how you assess each system so you start out whenever you're looking at a system you're going to inspect it then palpate percuss and then auscultate except you're going to change it up a little bit whenever you're going over the abdomen you're going to inspect auscultate percuss and then palpate and the reason that you're going to auscultate second instead of last is because whenever you perform palpation percussion if you did that before it could alter the bowel sound so we want to go ahead and just auscultate get a baseline of what we can hear and then we will percuss and palpate so first what you want to do is you want to perform hand hygiene and provide privacy to the patient then introduce yourself to the patient and explain what you're going to be doing so hello my name is sarah and i'm going to be your nurse today and i need to perform a head-to-toe assessment is that okay with you okay then proceed and look at their armbands so while you're doing this this is going to help you make sure you have the right patient and you're going to be testing them to see if they know who they are their date of birth and ask them some other questions to assess that neurostatus so say your first and last name for me first name is ben last name is dover okay and your date of birth 8 28 82. okay and do you want me to call you ben or mr dover what do you mean okay so ben can you tell me where you're at i'm at the hospital okay and can you tell me what we're doing here today uh head to toe assessment okay and who's the president of the united states donald trump okay so he answered all those correctly and he's alert and he's oriented times four he knew who he was he was able to tell me his name his date of birth where he was what we're doing and current events so we can chart alert and oriented times four then you want to collect vital signs such as the patient's heart rate blood pressure temperature oxygen saturation respiratory rate and the patient's pain rating so ben are you having any pain on a scale zero to ten with zero being no pain at all and ten being the worst pain you've ever had no pain zero okay and i have a video on how to assess those vital signs in depth if you want to watch that video and a card should be popping up so you can access that video then after that what you want to do you can collect their height and their weight and look at the bmi their body mass index remember if it's 18.5 or less that's underweight or if it's greater than 30 that is obese now while you've been doing all that asking them these questions doing their vital signs you're also before you've even really assessed the system you are already collecting information for instance how is that patient responding to you what's their emotional status are they calm are they agitated are they drowsy what's going on with them do they look their stated age does his skin color match his ethnicity is he does he understand my questions or does he seem like he can't hear them very well or is there a delay whenever he responds to me or does he respond appropriately and at an appropriate time also do you notice any just outward abnormalities like an amputation any masses lesions is his skin sweaty cold and clammy do you notice any cyanosis right off the bat also do is his hygiene good and is his posture good and do you notice any abnormal smell so during all that you're really collecting all that information now what we're going to do is we're going to start with the head and move our way down to the toes so we are first going to inspect the head and we are looking at the skin color he it's nice and pink we're also going to make sure that the head is the same size as how it should be for the body and it is and we're looking for any abnormal movements or twitching of the face that he can't control that are involuntary and we don't see anything and we're making sure that the face is symmetrical there's no drooping on one side like in this picture there's drooping on one side of the face and this can be seen in bell's palsy or in stroke and we're also just looking at the eyes and the ears are they at the same level and while we're here we're going to go ahead and look at the facial expressions and test cranial nerve 7 which is the facial nerve so can you close your eyes tightly for me and open them up okay now smile for me frown and puff out your cheeks okay and he did that with ease so that cranial nerve is intact next what we're going to do is we're going to palpate the head the cranium we're going to check for any masses indentations look for skin breakdown any infestations and for this part i like to wear gloves so let's look at the hair so what we're doing is we're filling for any masses indentations and also with this we're looking for any skin breakdown and if your patient's immobile you really want to check the back of the head back here because they're laying on it a lot and there can be breakdown back there also while you're doing that look inside the hair make sure there is no infestations like lice and there's no abrupt like rounding areas of baldness which could represent alopecia then after that since this patient has a beard you want to check the beard as well any lesions any infestations or anything like that and just look around and then once you're done with that what you want to do is you'll doff your gloves and perform hand hygiene next what we're going to do is we're going to find the temporal artery and we're going to palpate them bilaterally and they are both found right here and that his are about a two plus and then while we're right there we're going to go ahead and test cranial nerve five which is the trigeminal nerve and this nerve is responsible for many things like mastication so what i'm gonna have you do then is i'm gonna have you clench your teeth like bite down for me and i'm going to fill them with cedar muscle which is right there that should be a nice firm ball and then feel the temporal muscle now what i'm going to do to also test that nerve is have him try to open his mouth against resistance so try to do that for me okay and he can do that now while we're here we're going to go ahead and feel the temporal mandibular joint and we're going to feel right here and i'm going to have you open and close your mouth and i'm feeling for any grading or clicking sensations and i feel none then we're going to palpate the sinuses and i'm going to put pressure on these two sinuses right here and you tell me if you feel any pain okay so the max max maxillary and the frontal no next we're moving down to the eyes and we're going to inspect the eyes first and we're looking at several things we're looking at the eyelid we're looking at the sclera which is the white of the eyes we're looking at the iris we're looking at the pupil and we're looking at the conjunctiva so you shouldn't see any swelling of the eyelids you should see that the sclera is white and shiny it shouldn't be yellow like in jaundice and the conjunctiva when you pull down the lower lid have the patient look up it should be nice and pink it shouldn't be red you shouldn't see any drainage or anything like that and look at the eyes how do they set in the eye socket is are they equal for instance says is there any strabismus is there a cross eye where one eye turns in more turns out or up or down and these eyes are normal there's no strabismus next you want to look at antisequoria where you have where one pupil would be smaller than the other people are they equal in size normal pupils should be three to five millimeters in their measurement and here his are about a three and they are equal next what we're going to do is we're going to assess some cranial nerves we're going to be looking at cranial nerve three which is ocular motor four trochular and then six which is abducens and we're gonna do several tests to check their function the first one what we're gonna do is we're gonna be looking for any involuntary shaking of the eye called nystagmus and how we're going to do that is we're going to take our pen light we're going to hold it about 12 to 14 inches away from the patient's nose and then what i want you to do is keep your head still don't move your head and just use your eyes to watch where i move the pin line and as you're doing this you're going to do you're going to perform it in the six cardinal fields of gaze and you're just going to move it and you're looking for any involuntary shaking of the eyes so here we go next we're going to see how reactive the pupils are to lie and to do that we're going to dim the lights a little bit and we're going to have the patient stare off at a distant object that helps dilate those pupils and then we're going to shine using our pin light in at the side and we're going to see how that pupil responds it should constrict and then on the other side it should constrict as well so say their baseline people size was like three millimeters it should go down to one milliliter and it should happen on both sides okay so ben stare off at that object right on the wall over there for me okay and that dilates the pupils and we're just gonna shine light in at this side okay constrict constrict okay then dilate again then go back to the other side do the same again and they both constricted in equal size next what we're going to do is we're going to check for accommodation and how we do that is we turn the lights back on we just previously had them dim but we now make it light again we're going to have him stare off at a distant object that helps dilate the pupils and we're going to take a pen light you can use a pin light finger and you're just going to slowly move it inward to the nose and what you're looking for is that those pupils constrict they accommodate and the eyes cross while looking at the pen line so here we go stare off in the distance please and i don't want you to move your head or anything just keep it real still and just follow this pin light okay ready okay so now we can document because we just checked all of the things with the eyes we can document that the pupils are equal round reactive to lie and accommodate so that's where that acronym p-e-r-r-l-a comes into play next we're gonna move on to the ears so first what we do is we inspect the ears we look on the outside of the ear is there any abnormalities any redness any drainage anything like that and ben are you having any pain in your ear okay and sometimes if you have patients who've had long-term gout on the helix of the ear they may have what's called a tophi which is an accumulation of like a whitish yellowish uric acid crystal on the skin so if you ever see that that is what that looks like next we're going to palpate on the ear we're just going to move it around and bend tell me if you have any tenderness whenever i do that and any feel any abnormal masses or lesions and then move the targets a little bit does that hurt or anything like that okay so no pain or tenderness then we're going to palpate the mastoid process which is the big hump behind the ear and we're looking at it is it swollen is there any redness and whenever i touch on it then does it hurt okay and just see if the patient reports any tenderness with that then while you're there you can use the otoscope to inspect the tympanic membrane and remember the tympanic membrane should be a pearly gray translucent color and should be shiny so for an adult you're going to pull the pin out of the ear up and back and we're just going to inspect it and also while we're looking at that we're looking at the cone of light and remember the cone of light in the right ear should be at five o'clock and then the left ear should be at seven o'clock next we're gonna do one more thing with the ear we're gonna test cranial nerve eight which is the vestibulo cochlear nerve and what i'm going to do is i'm going to include one of his ears and then whisper two words on the other side he needs to tell me what i said so you ready okay i'm gonna include this one apple banana okay very good dog cat dog okay and that nerve is intact next we're going to move on to the nose and we're going to inspect the nose we're going to make sure it's midline on the face which it is we're going to look at the septum is it deviated anything like that and ask the patient or you have any trouble with your nose are you having any drainage or anything like that no and you want them to make you want to check the patency of the nose so then i'm going to have you occlude one side the nostril breathe out the other and vice versa okay heard airflow airflow nice and patent because sometimes people can have polyps that can block it or the deviated septum then you want to take your pen light and you just want to look inside the nose look for any drainage redness or any like polyps or anything like that and everything looks clear i don't see anything and then we're going to test the olaf factory cranial nerve one the sense of smell so ben what i'm going to have you do is i'm going to have you close your eyes and i want to put something in front of your nose and have you breathe in and smell and you tell me what you smell and whenever you do this use something that's pleasant smelling not something that's really stinky because it could elicit like a gag reflex or something like that if the person has a sensitive nose okay vanilla okay and this was vanilla extract and that's correct so that cranial nerve is intact next we're going to move on to the mouth and for this part like to wear gloves and if your patient is coughing and hacking you might want to wear a mask with a shield so you don't get any mucus on your face or in your mucous membrane so first what we're going to do we're just inspecting the lips make sure they're nice pink color they're not chapped there's no sores on them and one thing with a lot of patients whenever their oxygen saturations are low their lips may turn dusky or blue color so you want to make sure they're nice and pink because that can represent our oxygen level now let's inspect the inside of the mouth but first let's test cranial nerve 12 which is the hypoglossal nerve and what i'm going to have you do then is i'm going to have you stick out your tongue and move it side to side okay and he does that with ease now what we're gonna do is we're going to inspect the inside of the mouth you'll need a tongue blade for that and just open up your mouth for me and i'm gonna look on the inside of the cheeks nice and pink don't see any sores you're looking to see if they're nice and pink and there's no lesions or anything like that and stick out your tongue for me the tongue should be moist like this and pink you don't want it to be beefy red which is like in pernicious anemia you don't want it to be dry or cracked that could be dehydration cut you can put the tongue in then i want you to lift up your tongue for me and look for any lesions underneath the tongue that's where mouth cancer can hang out and i don't see any okay you can close then you'll while you're also looking at the gums open up a little bit you're going to look around for cavities any loose or broken teeth no dental caries in there then okay sort of open up your mouth a little bit more put your tongue down and you're going to look at the soft and hard palate now while you're in there you want to look at the uvula make sure it is nice and midline and his is nice and midline and we're going to test cranial nerve 9 the glossopharyngeal so what i'm going to do is i'm going to have you say ah and what you want is that uvula to move up okay and then we're just going to test the gag reflex i'm sort of just going to poke a little bit back there and elicit a gag reply okay there you go kag's really good and cranial nerve 10 the vegas is intact because he's able to talk with talk to me without hoarseness and he's able to swallow then when you're done inspecting the mouth be sure you take off your gloves and perform hand hygiene now moving on to the neck so what we're going to do is we're going to inspect the neck first so you're going to have the patient extend the neck up a little bit and you're looking at that trachea is it midline look for any lesions and look for any lumps like what you might see in thyroid problems like a gourder and we don't see any of that then what we're going to do is we're going to test cranial nerve 11 which is the accessory nerve so again what i'm going to have you do is move your head side to side up and down okay and then shrug try to shrug against my resistance and he does that with ease so that nerve is intact then we're going to place him at a 45 degree angle and we're going to have him turn his head to the side and what we're looking at is the jugular vein we're looking for any jugular vein distension jvd so again i'm going to just turn your head to the side like that and we're looking for any distinction of the vein and we do not see any next what we're going to do is we're going to palpate so we're going to palpate that trachea just to confirm it is midline and ben do you feel any tenderness or anything like that ask him if he feels any tenderness and i don't feel any lumps the next what we're going to do is we're going to palpate the lymph nodes all sights of those and as i do this tell me if you feel any tenderness and what i'm feeling for is any hard lumps or anything that may be in flame so what we're going to do turn a little bit this way and there we go we're going to start at the pre-auricular which is right in front of the ears then we're going to go to the back of the ears the post auricular then we're going to go to the occipital the parotid jugular digastric then we're going to go to the submandibular and then the submental then we're going to go to the superficial cervical and then we're going to make our way down to the deep cervical chain any tenderness so far then we're going to go to the posterior cervical and then right above the clavicle we're going to go to the supraclavicular and did not feel anything and no tenderness next we're going to palpate the carotid artery and this is one artery that you do not palpate bilaterally you do one individually so we're going to feel on this side and you're going to find it next to where the groove of the neck and next to the trachea and his is nice and bounding it's two plus then we're just gonna fill on the other side and same strength two plus and lastly what we wanna do is we're gonna auscultate the carotid artery and you're gonna do one side at a time and you're gonna compare sides and you're going to listen with the bell of your stethoscope and we're listening for a brewery which is a swishing sound so ben what i'm going to do is i'm going to have you breathe in breathe out and hold it for me okay go breathe and breathe out okay you can breathe normally now did not hear it on that side okay breathe in breathe out for me and hold it okay and i did not hear a brewery on that side as well now let's move to the upper extremities so what we're going to do is we're going to inspect the extremities and we're looking for any lesions any redness swelling and this is a good time if they have a central line an iv that you look at that make sure it's not red does iv need to be changed does that picc line or central line need a dressing change assess that then you can palpate and what we're going to do is we're going to palpate our pulse our radial artery so fill those bilaterally and they are two plus and they're equal then we're going to check capillary refill and to do that we're just going to press down on that nail bed and see how fast it comes back and it's less than two seconds then we're going to check skin target by just pinching the skin and see how fast it goes back and that was good then we're just going to look at the range of the motion of the fingers and the hands look at these joints in the hands do you see anything abnormal like for instance like herbedine or beauchard's nodes which are found in osteoarthritis and acetation are you having any pain in your hands or anything like that no then you can palpate the brachial artery which is found in the bends of the arm and just fill those because that's another pulse site and those are two plus and just as a side note if this was a patient that was getting dialysis and they had an av fistula you would want to palpate that and feel for the thrill make sure that that is present up in that arm wherever their fistula is at then you want to test the muscle strength so what we're going to do is i'm going to have you squeeze my fingers as hard as you can okay okay that's really good then i'm going to have you push up against my hands and i'm going to push up against your arms okay push okay very good okay and five plus normal strength then we're just going to test his put your hand underneath the elbow and just feel as you move the arm do you feel any grading crepitus of those joints a lot of times in arthritis you can feel that and move that bilaterally another thing you want to do with the upper extremities is to check for a drift and what you will do is you'll have the patient hold out their arms and close their eyes hold it up for about 10 seconds and you're looking for a drift like this so go ahead do that and close your eyes okay and we're assessing to see if this hand will drift upward and a lot of times if a patient has had a stroke okay you can put them down has had a stroke or something like that you will see a drift next we're moving on to the chest and we're going to inspect the chest we're looking for any abnormalities like lesions or any wounds anything like that we're also inspecting the patient's effort of breathing is it really labored are they using those accessory muscles to breathe also we're looking at that anterior posterior diameter so turn to the side like that and you're looking for that barrel chest and it will be increased in patients with like copd they will have what's called the barrel chest and now what we're going to do is we're going to listen to heart sounds and then we're going to listen to lung sounds so first let's auscultate heart sounds and we're going to do this in five locations and they're based on where the valves are located and i like to remember the mnemonic all patients effectively take medicine and the first letter of each word represents the valve except for effectively so a would be aortic p in patients would be pulmonic effectively would be herb's point and this is just the halfway point between the base of the heart and the apex of the heart and there's no valve location there and then t is for tricuspid and then m is for medicine so again using the diaphragm we're going to listen at the right of the sternal border at the second intercostal space and that's going to be the aortic valve so to find that second intercostal space find the sternal notch go down to the angle of lewis then just go a little bit to the right and you're in the second intercostal space and this will be the aortic and we're just listening lub dub lub dub s1 s2 and s2 the dub is going to be louder in this location then we're going to go a little bit over to where the pulmonic valve is found that's on the left of the sternal border at the second intercostal space so we're just right across again just listening to lub dub lub dub and s2 dub is going to be louder in this location then we're going to go a little bit down to the third intercostal space and this is herb's point and again you can hear lub dub but there's no specific valve here then we're going to go down to the fourth intercostal space and this is where the tricuspid valve is and lub s1 is going to be the loudest at this location then we're going to go to the fifth intercostal space mid clavicular line and we're going to listen to the mitral valve and again s1 is going to be loudest here dub and there's something special about this site this is the point of maximal impulse this is where you're going to listen for the apical pulse so we're going to set here we're going to count it for one full minute and a normal apical pulse in adult should be 60 to 100 beats per minute and his apical pulse was 63. then we're going to switch over with the bell of our stethoscope and we're just going to repeat in those locations and we're specifically listening for heart murmurs so that swishing blowing sound so that's what we're going to listen to with that and i did not hear any now let's listen to lung sounds now when you're listening to lung sounds you're listening for abnormal sounds and here are some samples of some abnormal sounds that you may hear crackles wheezes a friction rub or strider first we're going to listen anteriorly and what we're going to do is we're going to listen with the diaphragm of our stethoscope and we're going to start at the apex of the lungs and we're going to always compare sides and just enter way downward and assess all the lobes of that right and left lung so first let's start up here okay and then i want you to take good deep breath in and out so here we go apex okay we're going to compare sides then we're going to move down to the second intercostal space and this is going to help us assess the right upper lobe and the left upper lobe so another deep breath in and out then we're going to go down to the fourth intercostal space and we're going to assess where our right middle lobe is and our left upper lobe because remember the right lung has three lobes and the left lung has two lobes so let's listen to our left upper lobe we're just going to go down a little bit more then we're going to go mid axillary at the sick six intercostal space and we're going to listen to the right and left lower lobe so you just want to turn to the side right there until you get deep breath in for me okay other side okay now let's listen posteriorly again using the diaphragm and the stethoscope you're going to start listening at the apex and work your way down and one thing to keep in mind when you're listening back here you have the scapula and you don't want to listen over those because you won't be able to hear the sound so you're going to listen in between where the scapula and the spine are so down in these regions right here and again we're just going to compare sides and you can do this part at the end if you wanted to whenever you turn your patient over to look at their back side but we're just going to go ahead and do it now so we're going to start in the apex compare sides then we're going to find c7 which is that vertebral prominence it's the big ball right there you can't miss it and go down to about t3 and you'll be in between the shoulder blades and go a little bit in between the shoulder blades and the spine right in there and you're going to assess the right and left upper lobes then from t3 to t10 we're just going to inch around and we're going to listen to the right and left lower lobes okay now we're going to assess the abdomen and remember we're switching our sequence and how we assess we're going to do inspection auscultation and then percussion or palpation so we're going to do auscultation second so whenever you're looking and assessing the abdomen have the patient lay on their back and what we're going to do is we're going to inspect the abdomen and first i want to ask ben are you having any stomach issues at all no no okay and when was your last bowel movement yesterday morning yesterday morning and how are you urinating do you have any pain why you're peeing do you have problems starting a stream any discharge anything like that no it fits longer okay and with your male patients you want to ask about that due to prostate enlargement was starting a stream and if he was female i would ask him when his last menstrual period was and also again asked the female patient about urinating and things like that now if the patient had a foley this is the time when you would want to look at the urine inspect the foley and look at that just conglomerate your urinary system and your gi system together okay so we're inspecting the abdomen we're looking at the abdominal contour and this patience is scalphoid it goes in a little bit you can also have flat rounded or protuberant and also we're going to know if there's any pulsations a lot of times in this area right here on thin patients like with ben i can see the aortic pulsation in this patient's right above the umbilicus and looking at the belly button and checking for any masses do we see any hernias or anything like that also if your patient had any wounds you would want to look at that and if they had a peg tube you would want to assess the site make sure it's not red and ask them how it feels and with your ostomies with your awesomeness you want to look at the stoma and make sure it is like a rosy pink color it's not a dusky cyanotic color and it's not prolapse and look and see what type of stool it's putting out and note that note the smell note when if the bag needs to be changed anything like that so now we're ready to listen to the bowel sounds and what we're going to do is we're going to listen with the diaphragm of our stethoscope and we're going to start in the right lower quadrant and work our way clockwise and we're going to listen to all four quadrants and you should hear five to thirty sounds per minute and if you don't hear any bowel sounds you need to listen for five full minutes and you need to know are these normal are they hyperactive or hypoactive so let's listen okay this is our right lower quadrant we're going to move up to the right upper quadrant move over to the left upper quadrant and then down to the left lower quadrant and bowel sounds are normal now we're going to listen for vascular sounds and you're going to do this with the bell of your stethoscope and we're going to listen at the aortic we're going to listen at the renal arteries iliac arteries and you could listen at the femoral artery arteries if you needed to so you're going to listen at the aorta artery and it's a little bit below the xiphoid process a little bit above the umbilicus so about right here and we're listening for like a blowing swishing sound which would represent a brewee okay and none is noted then we're going to listen at the right and left renal arteries which is a little bit down from the aorta location so here's the right okay none note it and then over the left then we're going to listen at the iliac and it's a little bit below the belly button right here and this is the iliac artery and then listen on the other side and again like i pointed out you could listen at the femoral artery in the groin if you needed to now we're going to do palpation first we're going to do light palpation then deep and then as i do this please tell me if you feel any pain or tenderness so first we're going to do light palpation we'll just start in the right lower quadrant work our way around and you're going to go about two centimeters and you're just feeling for any rigidity any lumps masses anything like that how's that feel it feels fine okay okay now we're going to do deep palpation and we're going to go about four to five centimeters so a lot more deep and again you're just feeling for any masses lumps and ben tell me if you have any tenderness and sometimes you can do this with two hands if need be if you're not strong enough like me feeling anything feels nice and soft heard some belly sounds that's why you do this after you listen because you stimulate it okay everything felt good now we're going to assess the lower extremities so first what we're going to do is we're going to inspect we're going to look at the color from the legs to the toes making sure it's nice and pink and here we see that ben has a little bit of a tan line here and we're looking at the hair growth as well you want to make sure there's normal hair hair growth because in pvd you will see hairless shiny thin legs and here we have excellent hair growth and also do you see any abnormal swelling just right off the bat before you've even touched the patient and look at the legs and the feet for any swelling redness swelling do you have any pain or anything in your legs anything like that and looking at the joints make sure there's no redness on the joints because a lot of times with gout it likes to start out in the big toe so make sure that everything looks good and then on your diabetic patients make sure you look at the bottoms of their feet because these patients don't have the best feeling in their feet so their shoes could be wearing on them or they could have stepped on something and not even know it so inspect those feet make sure there's no ulcers or anything that like that that needs to be addressed also look at the toenails do the toenails look healthy or is there fungus are they missing toenails they have a really bad ingrown toenail so assess for that next you want to palpate your pulses we'll palpate the popliteal pulses which are behind the knee and those are about two plus they're equal bilaterally i'm just filling his legs they're nice and warm and i'm going to push over his tibia firmly and i'm seeing if there's any edema so push there and if there is edema a lot of times whenever you push down it's like this hard light type gel it'll just separate and your finger will leave this indention and here we don't have any now we're going to palpate on the feet and we're going to fill on the pulses and i'm going to don gloves perform hand hygiene dawn gloves and we're going to feel on the pulses and the feet we're going to feel on the posterior tibial and 2 plus really good and then we're going to fill the dorsalis pedis which is on top of the foot two plus with that and if you can't ever find these because sometimes these are hard to find in patients you can get a doppler if you have one on your floor next i'm going to check the capillary refill on his toes just like how we did with the fingers by pushing down in less than two seconds check the other one okay now i'm going to have him push against my hands push against my hands ben okay good job now i'm going to have you raise your legs against resistance good job now we're going to check the babinski reflex and you can use your reflex hammer for this and use the end of it or you can use your finger if you don't have that and what we're going to do is we're going to take this up through the ball of the foot and curve it and we're looking for the toes to curl in which would be a negative normal response so let's check that okay okay and that was normal then we're going to dolph our gloves and perform hand hygiene and next we're going to assess the back so whenever you're looking at the back side you're going to look from the head all the way down at the back and you really want to pay attention to any abnormal moles lesions wounds anything like that and assessing for skin breakdown especially on your patients who are mobile so that would really be concentrating on in the backside area on the coccyx because that's where a lot of breakdown happens and on the back of those heels if you couldn't see it whenever you were assessing the feet and also you could if you hadn't already you could listen to the lung sounds as you have the patient over on the back okay so that wraps up the nursing head to toe assessment now please be sure to check out my other videos because i have a lot of nclex review videos to help you study for nclex along with other nursing skill videos career tips and everything

        "video_sub_title": "Fluid in the middle ear is referred to in the medical literature as serous otitis media. And serous otitis media occurs in the middle ear for several different reasons. The most common reason is as a result of a middle ear infection. Oftentimes when the acute infection which is causing pain or discomfort, is resolved, there will be leftover fluid that doesn't drain from your middle ear. And it doesn't drain because your eustachian tube is swollen closed. This is usually treated with various anti-inflammatory drugs. But on occasion those drugs are not effective and the fluid must be surgically drained. This fluid is drained by making a small hole in the eardrum, which is called a myringotomy. This is a procedure that can be done on an adult in the office painlessly with a topical anesthetic. Young children, however, who will not hold still in the office, often need to be sedated in the operating room with a light general anesthetic.",

        "video_title": "Ghrelin the hunger hormone and how to use it to your advantage!",
        "video_sub_title": "hey gang happy Saturday so I wanted to jump on and talk to you a little bit about the blog that I posted earlier in the week about hunger why am I so hungry all the time if you're catching this on the replay my name is Amanda Nyberg I'm a registered dietician specializing in bariatric and weight loss nutrition and my goal is to provide you with relevant nutritional strategies that help you stay on track and get back on track with your weight loss so basically I want to talk to you about the hunger hormone ghrelin yes there is a hormone produced in our stomach that makes us feel hungry and learning how to regulate your hunger hormone ghrelin learning how to use this hormone to our advantage will help you be more successful in the long run with your weight loss goals so let's talk about grilling so growing is produced by the stomach and it's increased production the closer we get to meals so this is what makes you feel hungry throughout the day so it's highest in concentration right before we now the thing that we have to do is we've got to learn to use ghrelin to our advantage and we have to understand that we evolved as humans a long time ago to live in periods of famine where there is not much food available and so our body is able to regulate itself in those scenarios the problem is is we sometimes just don't allow our body time to work its magic before we kind of sir come to that hunger so I'm going to teach you what happens when we allow ghrelin levels to increase and how it will help you to lose weight in the long run so you have to understand what happens as we increase ghrelin levels in order to see the benefit so the number the first thing that happens as our ghrelin levels increase we produce more growth hormone and that's a great thing growth hormone is super beneficial for weight loss fat metabolism people pay a lot of money to inject themselves with growth wear something that's produced in the stomach will actually increase the production of growth hormone it makes you feel younger it makes you um have more energy so that's a good thing so increase gremlin ghrelin equals more growth hormone when number two ghrelin increases the effects of dopamine what's dopamine dopamine is what is the thing that's secreted by your brain that makes you feel incredible so a lot of people are super concerned about fasting intermittent fasting because they think they're gonna feel really weak they think they're gonna feel really tired really rundown and it's really just the opposite and that's because there's an increase in effect of those on the dopamine so we feel really good in that fasted state and then the last thing that ghrelin does is it it plays a huge role in neuro trophy and neuro trophy is just a process in the body that helps to build it helps our neuron survive it helps the functioning of the brain and all of these things have a huge impact in how you feel so for example the biggest impact ghrelin has is in the part of the brain that that is responsible for short-term memory for long-term memory and for spatial navigation so not only is this hormone super beneficial but it helps you to remember your memories it helps you to navigate throughout a room so ghrelin can do a lot of very positive things in the body and the best way to use gremlin to your advantage is through intermittent fasting because when we incorporate intermittent fasting we are ultimately allowing our ghrelin levels to increase over time a much longer time than we're typically used to so therefore we have more growth hormone so we're burning more fat we have more sensitivity to dopamine so we feel incredible and our brains are regenerating and and staying healthy there's a ton of research going on right now with minute fasting and things like Alzheimer's can intermittent fasting / prevent Alzheimer's can inter minute fasting delay the symptoms the onset symptoms of Alzheimer's that's what they're looking at because it's there's so many powerful things that happen hormonal e in our bodies when we're fasting now this is the key all right this is what you've got to remember in order to take advantage of ghrelin you have to be comfortable with feeling a little hungry that's the hard part all right have you ever let me let me just put it in this scenario have you ever been in a situation where you are super hungry and you don't have access to food so there's nothing you can do about it and time goes on and eventually you're not hungry anymore alright in that scenario you have allowed ghrelin to work to your advantage you have allowed that hormone time to stimulate that growth hormone so now you got energy you're burning fat you feel good you're not sluggish and hungry you've allowed ghrelin to increase enough that now you're sensitive to dopamine so again you feel great all of a sudden you feel good like you're not hungry anymore so if you allow yourself to feel hungry for a little while then eventually it'll pass and you'll get the benefits of that ghrelin yes so I love that so learning how to manage your hormones is super important so ghrelin is our hunger hormone we're gonna learn about leptin I've got a lot to say about leptin which is the hormone that makes you feel full and satisfied and that's really what it comes down to intermittent fasting it's not about starving yourself I think that's the biggest misconception it is about managing your eating windows so that all of these incredible hormonal changes happen to your benefit yes if you're a client of mine and you love intermittent fasting and you're watching this give me a thumbs up give me a heart there are so many people that are so intimidated by my programs because of the intermittent fasting and I want to tell people how wonderful they're gonna feel when they finally incorporate this advanced nutritional strategy into their life if you're interested in learning more about intermittent fasting I

        "video_title": "How to Heal Rotator Cuff Injuries with Soft Tissue Treatments, Exercise and Kinesiology Tape",
        "video_sub_title": "so what we're going to do now is we're going to go through some basic protocols associated with some rotator cuff and impingement soft tissue treatments a few exercises to help stabilize and remodel these tissues and then we're going to apply some kinesiology tape to assist and support that shoulder through movement to help assist in those tissues actually remain in a healing state and to prevent repetitive strain on them as they go through their motion patterns so Bob's going to be our lovely model for us today and we're going to look at our first aspect of this it's going to be associated with our soft tissue treatments our soft tissue treatments are going to be focusing on a couple of major things the first one is going to be if there's actual tendinopathy so if we did a manual muscle test on our patient for whether it be supraspinatus and they're going out ciaochao chill keep that thumb up because we don't want to create impingement just yet and that's painful or we test posterior cuff down here and that's painful on testing we know that there's definitely some tendinopathy associated with it now from that perspective we know that we need to do a pro-inflammatory style of a treatment on the tendons because we have to remember these tendinitis --is that everybody loves to call them are really tendinopathy tendinosis the ropes that are fraying from the inside-out so what we need to do is create a very focal inflammation at that tendon to reinstitute the healing cascade create collagen remodeling and actually bring more fibroblasts to the area to lay down even more collagen now in association with that we're going to be using some exercises at the same time because what we do know from the literature is that if we apply eccentric loading associated with tendinopathy treatment a pro-inflammatory application we'll get a greater collagen production and the fibroblasts that we're bringing to the area because we're going to be using our instruments to create that pro-inflammatory response that's going to bring in all those extra fibroblasts activate the ones that are focal in the area and then the eccentric loading is going to increase that collagen production so we're going to start right from there if I can have you actually take your shirt off so if we're going to do some of that eccentric loading we can use the CL X that we have right over here we're gonna double this up even though this is this is a little bit heavier resistance but all I want you to do is we're gonna come out right into that concentric load and then I want you to just slowly bring the arm back down and then when we do the eccentric propose to your cuff we're gonna be here and we're gonna slowly come back okay so the first thing we'll do is apply a little emollient right to those tendon areas understanding the two major regions that we have for tendinopathy are going to be either the Myo tenderness Junction or insertion point in the front of the shoulder when we're talking about the supraspinatus however remember it's just not a single tendon that comes and attaches to the greater tuberosity this tendon actually fans out along the front of the shoulder so we have to be a little bit more broad not just vocal on that tendon so we're gonna start him doing his eccentric loads thumb out and we'll get right up onto that tendon Regent we're gonna be a little bit more aggressive with our instrument we can follow it around around to the entire front of the shoulder and if we're going into that mild tenderness Junction we'll find the depth of penetration with a finger and then we'll take our instrument and come right along there now the important thing to understand when you're doing pro-inflammatory treatments is you're talking about 10 or 15 second versus we're not going to be doing this for three or four minutes that actually is going to create too much of an inflammation and from that perspective all we're doing is creating more soreness these are things that I've actually tested out over myself after 18 years of instrument assisted teaching is the simple reality is I've done it on my own patellar tendon tear and I tried five minutes I tried 20 minutes and the only thing 20 minutes actually does is just make your knee very very sore for a couple of weeks so what we've noticed it's doing about 10 or 15 second bursts is what really gives you the optimal recovery in those tendons part of it is a contact anesthesia that happens it actually numbs the area and then the second aspect is that pro-inflammatory response of starting the healing cascade all over again if we're switching to the posterior cuff we're just gonna concentrically loadout there we're gonna work into this area and once again finding those tendons being pro-inflammatory wrote over them I always use my finger to find that depth of penetration first then the instrument comes along so that you're not pushing in head you with stainless steel you're actually pushing in more with your finger and then we'll follow that tendon all the way out along the front until we hit that greater tuberosity now that's the first part of what we can do is sociated with a pro-inflammatory treatment associated with attendant injuries however when you're talking about impingement impingement really is much more of a global problem the muscles that are associated with controlling the shoulder are all out of balance and that's just looking locally there could be kinetic chain issues going around like a bad since we're working on is left shoulder could be a bad right hip there could be something going on wrong with that kinetic chain on the right hand side especially if it's a plant leg and a thrower or a volleyball player or something along those lines so we're gonna look at this just focally right now in that aspect however we're gonna treat this entire upper quadrant and a little bit more of what we call a neurosensory manner in other words it's just basically the weight of the instrument but what we're gonna do is normalize the tone of all this tissue a lot of the time when people talk about soft tissue treatments they like to say we're facilitating something or we're inhibiting something that's actually not the way it really works what we're doing is we're stimulating the receptors in the skin these receptors are a beta fibers and because of that they get really reflexively loopback within the central nervous system and they control the spindle so in other words if the spindle is overactive it helps calm it down if it's under active it helps wake it up so it helps control the firing pattern as well as the length tension of that tissue so we're gonna normalize all of those tones and it's just to understand that you actually create a neuro sensory stimulus all you got to look for is a hyper ami on the skin once we get that reddening on the skin you know that you stimulated the neural receptors because you created a vasodilation and again we'll work through that whole quadrant deltoid Peck upper trap levator region medial scapula stabilizers lower scapula stabilizers over the posterior cuff and again once we got a little bit of that hyperemia we can pretty much say alright we've normalized those tones which only takes again seconds to a few minutes because you're not trying to create this massive response it's just a hyperemia very very light pressure barely the weight of the instruments the next critical aspect in normalizing tissue actually happens within the axillary region these are critical areas for us to be able to work on in order to improve scapular dyskinesia one of the primary reasons we get a shoulder engine and there's a few areas in particular that I like to work with obviously we can neurosensory through the entire lat but the tendinous area at the inferior glenoid this is a major area of treatment that we want to look at the axillary fascia a lot of people like to say subscapularis but the reality is the subscapularis is so deeper probably not necessarily touching it but what we are touching is the axillary fashio as it folds into the area as well as the PEC fashion so we're going to do three separate movement patterns for this we're going to stay right here and we're going to just clot clip right on to that tendon and our patient is doesn't just gonna slowly raise that arm up and we're gonna just pin and stretch right through that two more times and last one and then the next area we'll work on is going to be that accelerator fashio the important thing here is not to actually over press into the tissue what we want to do is just find where the depth of penetration is where is the block we don't have to exceed where that block is come in grab it now what I do and I don't have the largest hands in the world but I love grabbing that inferior angle to scapula to assist in rotation so as he starts coming up again I'll push on that medial border of the scapula pulling into lateral rotation which is what's going to happen as we go through abduction assists the movement pattern while blocking and pinning stretching through that other tissue so we'll just demonstrate that one more time so we're going to pin through there and then our last one is going to be associated more with our PEC fashio now with the PEC fashio once again you're only going in as far as the tissue will allow you to go you don't have to exceed that and what we'll have the patient do is almost like a PMF pattern we'll grab right into that tissue and he's just going to open up into a PMF pattern and we can strip through that fashio anteriorly in the PEC one more time and for me those three areas actually tend to be the biggest bang for the buck associated with shoulder impingement because most of that problem tends to come from this area and scapular dyskinesia there are other reasons that we can look at and we'll talk about that a little bit more when we do our lectures this weekend once we've actually done that neuro resetting of those tissues we've done the tendinopathy treatments with a pro-inflammatory application the next thing that we're gonna look at is actually how do we help stabilize this when they leave our office and one of the best ways I've found to do it especially for shoulder impingement is an anterior superior translation taping this is one of the ones that have kind of taken through a couple of different sources and actually just merged them together however I came up with a test which is basically a mulligan mobilization to determine whether or not this is going to be an effective tape job one of the problems that I always have one with with taping is that people always say oh that tape didn't work for me well that's because they probably didn't evaluate you to know that the tape job will be effective my big thing when I teach taping is that every tape job has a pre and a post in other there's always going to see something on an evaluation that's going to show your tape job is going to be effective it's not a guess you know it before it even goes on the body so the Mulligan mobilization that we do with this is I'm just going to gently and I mean it's basically just the pressure of your hand no pushing right on the front of his shoulder let's just turn you around for a second back in my hand helps in that scapular motion and we're gonna just have an AB duct so he's just gonna bring that arm up into abduction well all the way up to thumb up and what we're looking for is with an impingement our patients are usually gonna say there's a painful arc or pain somewhere around shoulder level all the way up to the top that just tells you a little bit more of where the tendon injuries may be as well as where the impingement is and we're looking for em to you they're having an easier time moving the arm decrease pain or greater range of motion but any functional change that's going to show us that this is effective so once again we're gonna just block here and he's gonna come right up into a abduction now the first couple of times you do this you may just need to feel out the body's motion and then once you figure it out it's a lot easier to just move with them and help correct it and if the patient's going oh yeah that feels a lot better as you're stabilizing it we're going to go right through this tape job now now since we just used a ma lien on a patient I don't necessarily have some rubbing alcohol here right now to clean them off although we can use Biofreeze for that we would obviously clean off the the tissue that we just worked on with our soft tissue once we know it's dry we're going to start measuring out our tape job for the purpose of this demonstration we're just going to do it on the other shoulder because there's no emollient on it now the first tape job we do is the superior translation one and we're gonna measure from top of the shoulder we're going to measure down to just past the inferior angle of the scapula and that's going to be our first strip and the second strip we're going to do is measuring from the front of the shoulder to the medial border of the scapula and that's going to be our second cut now our first cut is what I like to call the lower case y we're gonna round these edges just to make sure it doesn't catch clothing for this tape job we are going to break the tails and then create a 2-inch base we'll take off the backing the first thing that we do is patient position we want to get him into his good anatomical position which helps put that head of the humerus back into the glenoid we're gonna apply that taping right to the back of the posterior cuff now it's about a 50% stretch now the great thing is with exact stretch tape from thera-band what we have here is our exact stretch indicators so I want to make sure that I'm getting a pretty decent stretch on this so the big hexagons in this area once I have them to an equidistant sides I know I'm at a 50% stretch and you can actually see this on that half one right here that's a non equidistant I hit it right there so now I can just lay the tape down I know exactly that I've gone to 50% stretch depending on how severe the translation issues are you may actually increase that stretch past 50% an important thing is never have stretch at the end of the tape otherwise that creates irritation and blisters on the back end all we're gonna do is paper off tension all the way down okay our second strip of tape this is for anterior translation the anterior translation tape job we're gonna place that right over those two tails making sure that we have part of the tape on the skin tape doesn't like to stick to itself and now depending on the size of your shoulder is how much you're really going to stretch this again how much translation the shoulder will also influence it but when I have a guy who's got a big muscular shoulder let's just say like somebody like a linebacker or maybe a defensive lineman offensive lineman somebody with a really huge shoulder you're gonna put almost no stretch on the tape because the problem is is as they bring the arm up into abduction a large shoulder with a lot of stretch the tape will actually roll up now he's got a pretty muscular shoulder but nothing that I have to worry about that it's gonna roll up that easy so I can go anywhere between 25 and 50% stretch here we can see we've exceeded 25% now with the small exact stretch indicator and now I'm just gonna lay down the tape the rest of the way we've got to always got to make sure that we rub this tape it's heat activated and especially when tapes over tape you really want to give it an extra rub to make sure that it sticks and now when he goes through his abduction movement pattern he'll probably notice it's a little bit easier to go through movement go ahead and just give that abduction again and it also takes a lot of pressure off your impingement but the important thing is we had a test beforehand that told us it would be a proper tape job not going oh this is what I do for shoulder impingement and guessing it will work when I teach taping classes my first algorithm for taping is don't tape if you don't have something that shows up positive that tells you the tape job is going to be effective why are wasting your time your money or your patients money it doesn't make any sense tape is a massive effective tool when it's used properly so I thank my lovely model here for going through our soft tissue treatment as well as our taping procedures what we would always finish off with with our taping especially for somebody store we can take our bio freeze and literally spray right over the tape and we can rub that in well thanks for spending some time with us and watching our shoulder impingement you",

        "video_sub_title": "Speaker 1: Can I have a piece? Speaker 2: Mm-hm. Try it. It's really good. Speaker 1: Hey, Anthony, can you go get help? Speaker 2: Mm-hm. Speaker 3: In all my years as a licensed paramedic, working on the street, not many acute illnesses are as scary as a severe allergic reaction. We have a fancy word to call that. It's called \"anaphylaxis,\" which is the body's reaction to something that is causing them to have a number of different symptoms that could lead to a life-threatening emergency. In this scenario, we're going to teach you what anaphylaxis is, what it's doing in the body, and then how we maybe able to treat them until emergency medical services arrive. So what anaphylaxis? Anaphylaxis is an allergic reaction, where the body does different things at the same exact time. While the blood vessels are dilating and becoming leaky, allowing fluid to leak out into the tissues of the body, decreasing the blood pressure, something else is tightening. And it's the airways. The bronchioles, the alveoli sacs, are filling with mucus and fluids, and basically we have these two mechanisms working together to create a serious life-threatening problem. So the signs that this person might be showing is not only the itchy, the hives, the scratchy, the itchy throat, the swollen tongue, the swollen lips. Those are kind of superficial as far as the outside of the body. But what is happening inside is what we hear, most of the time. And that's difficultly breathing, wheezing, gasping for breath, and not being able to get it in. This is caused by those bronchoconstrictions, as well as well as the fact that she might be headed into looking pale, because her heart rate is trying to increase and she's also losing blood pressure. So, these are some things that we're going to be ware of as we're dealing with this anaphyatic patient. Now, in this scenario though, she was wise. She understands that she's having a problem and she told somebody who was a bystander to get help. In this training scenario, she's already been prescribed epinephrine for these types of emergencies. But in the case, didn't know she had a food allergy. So her brother shared the candy bar with her, it might have had an allergen in it, obviously it did. And now she's reacting to it. So, as soon as we could, we got to her EpiPen. A few points to think about here is we need to make sure that the date is still within the expiration range so that it, it's good. We're going to pull the cap off, the safety cap, and it's important to remember that we grip it firmly in our hand. But, we do not put a thumb over the needle area, or over the back of the EpiPen. Now that has been readied, I'm going to hand it to this victim, whose now going to auto-inject. She puts it into her big muscle in her thigh and holds it there for 10 seconds. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. She now takes it out of her leg and lays it beside her. While she does that, she massages the leg and tries to get the, the medicine to absorb into that deep inner muscular injection. Now, while we're letting that get into the system, if we have not already called 911, we should be. So, if you have a phone, dial 911, and get emergency medical services on the way. If you don't have a phone, send somebody to go call 911 immediately. If there's a delay in emergency medical services of greater than 5 to 10 minutes, and the patient actually has a second auto-injector available, we can actually deliver a second auto-injector if the signs and symptoms of her anaphylaxis have not improved. Now, we're always going to be monitoring this patient for an increased problem. Maybe a loss of consciousness, increased difficulty of breathing, or respiratory arrest, and then eventually cardiac arrest. And we're going to treat them accordingly while we wait for EMS to arrive.",

        "video_sub_title": "hello my lovelies what is the first thing you think about you think about joining martial arts is it kicking is it punching is it saving the world from evil ninjas no it should be laundry chances are if you're just starting out you have one uniform that you're planning to wear to every single class and it might have entered your mind how often do I really need to wash this answer these are gym clothes wash them after every single session now you might think to yourself but my sweat doesn't stink I sweat sparkles and perfume these are still white gym clothes and you're gonna end up on the ground we can all tell when you haven't washed them and that's just not hygienic I prefer to use my super wash pressure washing machine I also have a breathing mobile washer but I think the super washed is better with stiff materials carrying buckets of water isn't fun it is much easier to hook a garden hose to the faucet first unscrew the aerator the little mesh on the faucet that forces little bubbles through the water stream second get a faucet two hose adapter at the hardware store I really don't know why I hadn't thought of this before the washer easily fits one adult size karate uniform the washer works best when it is just over half full add less than a tablespoon of laundry soap be careful if you add too much you will have to do multiple rinse cycles to get the suds out that's also the reason that I prefer that powdered detergent fill the drum two-thirds of the way with cold to warm water hot water causes the bottom drain to leak set the lid on and screw down firmly the rubber seal will create an airtight drum turn the handle to spin the drum turn it slowly enough that this intrical force doesn't pin the clothes to the bottom of the drum but quickly enough that the drum creates a pressurized environment it should make kind of a suck thunk as it turns turn it for about two minutes the lid should make the sound of a seal being broken when unscrewed there is a drain at the bottom but I find it faster to dump the wash water from the top the drain also causes the suds to settle on the clothes which causes more rinse cycles this takes a bit of practice to not spill the water all over your countertops and floors but once you get it down it speeds up the process immensely repeat the previous steps two to three more times to thoroughly rinse the soap out a little vinegar helps to deodorize the gym clothes this is actually a pretty good arm workout in the last cycle when the water comes out clear with few soap suds dump the rinse water out at the top and then attach the drain to the bottom and allow the last of the excess water to be drained before you remove the clothes this next machine is optional it is possible to remove the uniform wring it out and line dry it it will take a day and a half to two days to dry it this way with a spin dryer imagine a giant electric salad spinner the uniform will come out only slightly damp and like take less than 12 hours to dry completely make sure that the load is balanced so the drum does not tilt from one side to the other and make sure that you have a dish underneath the spout to catch the water as you can see there's going to be quite a bit of water that's going to be wrung out of this uniform remove the clothes from the spin dryer and hang up to dry the spin-dryer does make the uniform a bit wrinkled and the line-drawing makes it a bit stiff but since I hot iron my uniform anyway to keep it looking sharp this isn't a problem and there you have it a clean and nice smelling tea no washing machine required unless you are a cat and then your whites remain white without such pedestrian methods as laundry",

        "video_title": "Kidney failure reversed GFR by accident - Not baking soda or vegetable diet - How to  23",
        "video_sub_title": "this is my story about how my kidney functions and the steps that I went through the thing that I tried and how well they worked and what happened to lead me accidentally to find something that actually worked and worked dramatically and when I say accidentally I do mean accidentally because I had no idea that what I was doing was going to actually rejuvenate and reverse my kidney function from going into complete failure in fact it was something I was doing because of a completely unrelated problem which I will go into later but first let me begin with what I tried in the past with my three-year battle and keeping my kidney function at least stable and even helping a little bit when I first found out that my kidneys were failing they were at a 46 filtration rate and then six months later went down to 37 which wasn't really serious but it was a big concern because they were in a downward spiral so I immediately started searching the internet to see if there was something that I could do to prevent me from going into a complete kidney failure I found two things that people were clinging to work and one was a completely raw vegetable diet and nothing else the greener the better and also another way was to take one teaspoon of baking soda two times a day for a week and then after waiting a week repeat it again because I was now terrified of a complete kidney failure I decided to try both of them at the same time and after another month the test field then back up to 46 now I was relieved that I could actually do something to help my kidney function since then I ease up and tried to eat at least one meal of raw vegetables per day and also continued with the baking soda but just once a day I was able to keep them stabilized and even though I was not consistent with it by staying above a 40 filtration rate until I had a series of calf scans which are known to damage kidney function loin if I continued to be more serious about taking the baking soda much more seriously and watching my diet again but they did slip down to a 31 filtration rate but thankfully I was able to improve them again to 38 from what I gather the reasons that the raw vegetables and the bacon sort of work is if they are both alkaline which neutralizes acids away from your kidneys so the kidneys can rest and heal themselves because the more acids and proteins that go through your kidneys the harder they need to work then about a year later I had another medical problem which was a bowel backup that led to a complete blockage and led to another surgery what I did before this last surgery caused a dramatic reversal of my kidney function from just a 38 filtration rate to an amazing 49 filtration rate just nine days later and just before my pre-surgery cat scan the subsequent test 18 days later was at 46 after this cat scan so what I did was obvious to me that I found something else that worked and maybe even faster here's what happened and what I did I had a partial blockage and had several bouts of not being able to have a bowel movement for days at a time I went on the internet again to find out what I could do and it seemed like it would be a good idea to go on a liquid diet to try to clean myself out or at least not to add any more buildup of the blockage I included in this liquid diet apple juice to use as a laxative and it also used one teaspoon of turmeric and one teaspoon of coconut oil which is supposed to relieve intestinal swelling and a Walmart brand of psyllium fiber which is the same thing as Metamucil so between these three things it worked after about 12 hours or so the other liquids that I used were fruit juices oranges and Gatorade I continued not to eat anything for three or four days and then only a small amounts of mushy foods like mashed potatoes and some gravy for taste and putting in jello the only solid food that ate was at breakfast consisting of two eggs and two slices of toast I did this for eight days I made a point to stay away from any meats and other things that are hard to digest like raw vegetables I really thought that I was okay at first because I was successful in turning everything into a combination of Tyria followed by some firmer stools but little did I know that this was a symptom of a partial blockage where liquid was not being absorbed and incorporated into the stools and was instead trailing through the blockage and loosening some impacted stools which gave me the impression that everything was okay but it turned out that I was not expelled enough and the build-up was accumulating until a complete blockage occurred which sent me to the hospital for an emergency surgery but before the surgery and as an ER doctor was sending me to get a cat scan I asked the doctor if it was completely necessary as my kidneys are bad and he told me that the blood tests showed that my kidneys were fine which were tested at 49 filtration rate I was quite surprised as my previous tests just nine days before was at 38 and I was not taking any baking soda or eating any raw vegetables during that time because I knew that raw vegetables are hard to digest and the baking soda neutralizes the stomach acids which both could cause constipation so that is my story and what exactly caused my fast reversal of declining function I can only guess I believe it had a lot to do with not eating anything for three to four days due to taking very little protein and acids but it could also have been because of the psyllium fiber and the tumeric powder or a combination of everything also what probably helped maintaining 46 filtration rate after my last cat scan and after the surgery was the fact that while I was in the hospital I was not allowed to eat anything for six days nor anything to drink for four days and then for two more days only allowed to suck on ice chips after that I was only eating bland mushy foods for another two weeks if you have any questions put them in the comment section and I will answer them the best that I can I hope this video helps you and I hope that you liked it enough to subscribe as subscribing would be a big

        "video_title": "How to Use Tube Gauze for Finger Injuries & Bandage Fingers",
        "video_sub_title": "I made this YouTube video to demonstrate one method that you can use at home to bandage a finger when you have a severe injury that's reading a lot so here's a quick run-through of my steps I've washed my wound really well I put some Neosporin on I put one or more of these really big bandaid on and put the tube goes on and then I put some kind of first-aid tape around it all to keep it kind of waterproof and then try and cover it with something even more waterproof when they need it say when I'm washing my hands for example so my primary reason for making this video is to show people how to put the tube goes on because it can be a little bit tricky but I wanted to show you - my tube guys which is actually really really old and my box was running out so I just found a replacement box on Amazon I really love this to dress stuff it really protects my wound a lot and once you know how to put it on it's amazing and I think everybody ought to have some in their medicine cabinet so now I'll show you my steps and how I use the tube gun first acting the injured area well and then I put one or sometimes several these big band-aids on these are the big band-aids that I use I got them from Amazon two boxes of 100 then I paid five dollars and sixty seven cents for I use them to cover the wound to keep it compressed in this case I can displace a flap off the top which I'm hoping is going to reattach and keep it sterile because with tube buzz while great isn't sterile so you need to band-aid first with some neosporin so to start with the first thing that I did was I cut a length of the tubing fabric six or seven inches long and start feeding it over the bent edge of what they call it the finger applicator I'm try to do this myself while I videotape those kind of hard especially because my fingers hurt but I'll basically I cite the applicator over my finger and then I take the fabric and slide it down and I'm going to have to stop use both hands but then I'll pick up the video again X forgot one important part which is after I have said it over the metal tube thing the edge gets really freed and so what I've been doing is cutting off a really really frayed part just so that there's like to clean it at the end of it so do that and then I put my finger in and slide it down so basically I tied the fabric down just enough so that I can hold on to it and then I pull the metal thing back leaving the fabric in place after I've slid the metal back I try and leave a gap of about maybe half an inch between the edge of the metal and my fingertip for twisting purposes because I'm going to take the metal part in my right hand and I'm going to twist put two times and then take the metal thing and shove it back over my finger again and it covers my fingertip that's really cool okay I started twisting it but then it kind of came on twisted but you get the idea I twist it twice and then I just kind of showed my finger back into the mouthing so this is what it looks like as I am shoving the second layer of favor back down over my finger then what I've been doing which is rather than having it go all the way down to the bottom of my finger I pull the middle thing off right about here and I kind of leave that folded edge above my knuckle so that I can bend my finger easily so this is what it looks like after I take the metal applicator and then the next or last step that I do is I just put a piece of kind of waterproof bandage tape around it this is the tape that I've been using it's 3/4 inches wide it stretches and for use it's waterproof and it sticks really well and not including a link to this one because they didn't get an Amazon and I got it or Walgreens this is what the final result looks like I actually ended up putting two pieces of tape on because one went 10 higher up to tape down the fold and then the second one was right along the bottom edge and keep the whole thing from coming off my finger and if I actually put another layer of tape up there which I did the first couple days when it was silver looting a lot it really keeps a pretty water group - but then they discovered these really cool things that Amazon called finger tops this is a box of the kind that I ordered and the next I'm going to show you what the actual looks like when they came okay these are the finger caps that I got from Amazon there are 36 in a packet and they come this is an assorted package of small medium and large and I have them kind of arranged by side before I was using some of those disposable gloves which were okay but they're really thin and kept dripping it looks like for me this size medium and the finger cap over and you basically just go down at the bigger finger and then roll it down so that's what it looks like I'll cover it up these things are amazing they work really well I can watch dinner dishes wash my face do all sorts of things and keep my bandage completely dry so it's taking me so long to make this video because of all the different little bits and pieces of it that my new circuit actually came in the mail so that is a picture of the box and a picture of the instructions on the box this 5/8 inch cause tube is what are we ordered to replace my size one which is a little bit smaller note that the metal applicator is included in the box this is the 7/8 inch the only difference of this one is it only comes in 10-year it's not 50 yards the last size that somebody might use for fingers and toes would be just one inch size for large fingers and toes I actually ordered these for next time place the tip off of my finger these are intended to be IV dressings but I saw a doctor who made a video on how he was using these in the unique manner to cover sugar finger tip ones and it was really awesome so I will include a link down in the description and I got carried away and ordered these gel protector thingies to but I think I got the wrong ones or ordered the wrong ones I think this is the one that I should have ordered they're expensive but also get great reviews [Music] [Music]",

        "video_title": "Exercises for osteoarthritis of the shoulder",
        "video_sub_title": "shoulder arthritis generally refers to damage to the smooth cartilage that covers the ends of the bones the cartilage gets worn away causing the rough phonons to rub against each other this leads to irregular motion within the joint and the development of bone spurs called osteophytes which are bony growth formed as the bone tries to heal itself the regular motion and bone spurs along with inflammation can result in pain and loss of motion in the shoulder there are two joints within the shoulder that can be affected by a Sioux arthritis the main joints that provides most of the motion is called the glenohumeral joint or gh joint which is where the arm bone or the humerus meets the shoulder blade the scapula the other smaller joint in the shoulder that does not provide much motion is the acromioclavicular joint or the AC joint where the collarbone connects to the scapula the cause of osteoarthritis oh wait in the shoulder is usually referred to as being either primary or secondary primary OE refers to arthritis with no identifiable contributing factors whereas secondary away is being a result of an injury or disease the most common complaint of someone with shoulder away is pain and loss of function pain over the back of the shoulder is usually due to klonoa Murrell arthritis whereas pain over the top of the shoulder is usually caused by acromioclavicular arthritis the pain worsen with activities especially with any activities that requires the arms to reach over the head in addition the motion of the shoulder can sometimes feel like grinding also known as crepitus as the bones rub against one another an individual can gradually lose motion which further limits their ability to do their daily activities fortunately not everyone who develops arthritis develops pain and loss of motion in fact some people with severe joint destruction have very few symptoms shoulder osteoarthritis can be managed by surgical and non-surgical treatment options the main surgical option is a total shoulder replacement in cases of severe arthritis it may provide pain reduction and allow patients to increase activities of daily living shoulder replacements tend to work better on older individual who have low demand on their shoulder fortunately there are a number of good non-surgical treatment options available for symptoms of osteoarthritis of the shoulder including exercise activity modification physical therapy non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs also known as NSAIDs and intra articular injections hot and cold treatment can also provide some relief while cold is helpful for reducing swelling especially in an acute injury it can also be helpful for chronic pain or for the pain and inflammation of a nap arthritis flair for aching shoulders without acute inflammation heat may be helpful instead exercise can be a useful way to help manage arthritis symptoms but it's important to be careful with certain activities shoulder arthritis can be aggravated by heavy lifting or overhead activities however reducing activity too much can be detrimental and it's important to maintain strength and range of motion in joints affected by arthritis you may find non-impact activities such as tai chi or water exercise helpful as they can support range of motion without adding stress to the joint regular exercise of the shoulder muscles can help reduce pain support healthy cartilage as well as increase range of motion and function the human shoulder is the most mobile joint in the body giving it a wide range of motion but this mobility makes the shoulder joint unstable forcing it to rely on its muscles to compensate for the instability keeping your shoulder muscles flexible and strong through regular exercises that activity can help decrease pain and increase function when you have osteoarthritis a way of the shoulder it's important to stretch and to strengthen the surrounding muscles to provide more support and reduce stresses around the joint remember to warm up before any exercise routine to help increase blood flow and flexibility a 10-minute walk or others slow paced aerobic activity can help get your muscles ready when practicing shoulder exercises make sure to maintain the proper form and use modification when necessary to avoid straining your joints when you have shoulder oay improving your overall posture will allow your shoulders to move in all directions more easily it's always important to be aware of your posture and correct any misalignment maintaining good posture is important while you perform your daily activities this exercise aids in general relaxation and pain relief of the shoulder stand in front of a steady chair or countertop leaning slightly forward place your left forearm on the top of the chair or this counter top for support and let your right arm dangle freely let your right arm gently swing from side to side back and forth and in small circles this should be done in a pain-free range using only gentle free movement repeat on the other side do this for approximately 30 seconds to 1 minute on each side one to three times per day this exercise helps to stretch the shoulder joint aiding in overall flexibility and ease of performing activities of daily living such as reaching into a kitchen cabinet lie on your back with your arms at your side slowly lift both arms up and overhead until you feel a gentle stretch in your shoulders slowly lower your arms back to your sides if this is difficult or painful try holding a broomstick in both hands across your body while holding the stick slowly lift both arms up and overhead until you feel a gentle stretch in your shoulder slowly lower your arms back to your sides perform this exercise five to ten times two to three times per day as pain allows this exercise helps to stretch the shoulder joint aiding in overall flexibility and ease of performing activities of daily living such as combing your hair lie on your back with your arms at your side and your elbows bent to 90 degrees hold a broomstick in both hands across your body while keeping your elbows bent use your right hand to push the stick towards the left side making your left forearm rotate towards the surface you're lying on you should feel a gentle stretch in your shoulder slowly return to the starting position repeat on the other side perform five to ten repetitions two to three times per day as pain allows the rotator cuff muscles are small but very important to maintain the integrity of the shoulder joint by keeping these muscles strong it will decrease pain and increase function the rotator cuff muscles lead endurance more so than maximal strength because they need to work every time you move your arm the shoulder has many muscular of attachment and it's important to work on all muscle groups within a pain-free range the strengthening exercises we'll be talking about are a symmetric and isotonic isometric exercise is a type of strength training that involves contracting in muscles without visibly moving the joint isometric exercise is done in one position keeping the joint stable rather than moving through a range of motion isotonic exercise is a form of strength training that involves contracting a muscle while moving a joint through its range of motion this can be done using weights resistance bands or your own body weight stand with your right arm by your side and the elbow flexed to 90 degrees reach across your body with your other hand to grip the outside of your right forearm try to pull your right hand towards your abdomen while resisting the movement you should feel your shoulder muscles contract in your right arm as you push against the opposite hand you could also use a doorframe for resistance or a fixed object standing sideways with your affected size against the doorframe or fixed object bend the arm you are exercising to 90 degrees and push the back of your fist into the frame keep your elbow tucked in to your side start by holding 5 to 10 seconds repeat on the other side do this exercise 3 to 5 times on each side build from 1 to 3 sets as tolerated attach an exercise ban to the doorknob of a closed door or a fixed object start with the light band your spine should be straight and tall your core muscles tight and your shoulders relaxed hold the band into your right hand bend your right elbow to 90 degrees and keep your elbow tucked in to your side pull the band away from your body keeping your wrist in the neutral position bringing your right forearm outwards and squeezing your shoulder blades together with control bring the bend back to the starting position and repeat start by doing five to ten repetitions building from 1 to 3 sets s pain allows repeat on the other side as you get stronger progress the band to greater resistance send with your right arm by your side and the elbow flexed to 90 degrees reach across your body with the other hand to grip the inside of your right forearm while keeping your elbow tucked in try to push your right forearm away from your body while resisting the movement you could also use a doorframe for resistance instead stand facing a doorframe with your right elbow bent to 90 degrees and your right palm against the frame try to push the palm of your hand into the doorframe start by holding 5 to 10 seconds repeat on the other side do this exercise 3 to 5 times on each side build from 1 to 3 sets as tolerated attach an exercise band to the doorknob of a closed door or to a fixed object start with a light band stand sideways with your right arm closest to the door or fixed object your spine should be straight and tall your core muscles tight and shoulders relaxed hold the band in your right hand bend your right elbow to 90 degrees and while keeping your elbow tucked in to your side pull the bed across the front of your body moving your right hand towards your opposite elbow with control bring the band back to the starting position and repeat start with 5 to 10 repetitions building from 1 to 3 sets as paint allows repeat on the other side as you get stronger progressed a ban to greater resistance stand facing a wall with your right arm by your side and your elbow bent to 90 degrees your right fist pointing towards the wall place a small pillow or towel between your fist and the wall keeping your back straight push your fists forward into the pillow toward the wall remember to keep breathing during this exercise start by holding 5 to 10 seconds repeat 3 to 5 times building from 1 to 3 sets as tolerated repeat on the other side stand in a split stance position with your right foot in front of your body and left look behind step on one end of an exercise band with your right foot and grip the other end in your right hand while keeping your elbows straight slowly raise your right arm up and away from your body as far as you can go without pain to a maximum of shoulder height then slowly return to the starting position start with five to ten repetitions building from 1 to 3 sets as pain allows repeat on your left side stand

        "video_title": "8-Year-Old Gets Toxic Shock Syndrome",
        "video_sub_title": "Toxic Shock Syndrome is a serious, even sometimes deadly disease. Many associate it with menstruation and the use of tampons, but one mom has made it her mission to warn that it can happen to anyone. Why? It happened to her eight year old daughter. Have a look. [Travis Voiceover] Gabby's story began with a small spot on her arm. Doctors told her it was just impetigo, a common skin infection, and sent her home with an ointment. But after a couple of days, Gabby kept getting worse. After developing swollen eyes and red, itchy skin, Gabby was then given allergy medication to help treat the increasing problem. But still, Gabby continued to get worse. It looked like someone had dipped her in boiling water, and eventually, she had to be admitted to the hospital. In the hospital, doctors put the young girl on an antibiotic drip, and told her mom Christine she might have Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. Finally, Gabby started to get better, and given a diagnosis. It was Toxic Shock Syndrome. Joining us now is Gabby and Christine via Skype. Christine, thanks for being with us. Gabby, thank you as well. What's going on here? We took her to the pediatrician and he went over her symptoms and her records from the hospital. He was like, \"She has Toxic Shock Syndrome.\" But with Toxic Shock Syndrome, she is at risk for it to reoccur. So it's really important that, as she gets older, she's very careful. Well I am so happy that you figured out what was going on, but most importantly, looking at Gabby, she looks like she's doing great. Gabby, how are you feeling? Good. Was that scary? (applause) You look good. Yeah, she looks good. Yeah, I got itches that I couldn't really get to. (laughter) But all that's better now? Yeah. That's great. And it highlights something that most people don't think about because if you've heard of Toxic Shock Syndrome, you do, you think, tampons, or a foreign body, you talk about nasal packing. Nasal packing could do it. In fairness, even in medical school, that was the big focus. But impetigo, an infection I'm sure you've seen so many times in your career, the fact that that could theoretically lead to Toxic Shock Syndrome, or in reality can, a lot of people don't know that. Yeah, right, and so I think, Christine and Gabby, thank you so much for sharing your story, because I think it's going to bring some much needed attention that this can occur outside the realms we all think of. Yeah, of course. But impetigo, what you were saying, is a really common skin infection with usually Staph aureus, but sometimes strep. Toxic Shock, interestingly, is more of a systemic syndrome that comes from the toxin produced by those bacteria, so exactly like what Gabby experienced later on. And those scary diagnoses you were given: Stevens-Johnson, Staph scalded skin, those are all after-effects similarly of bacterial infections, so the bottom line is, if you or someone you know, especially a child, has a bacterial infection, and they seem to be getting worse in any sort of systemic way, then they need medical attention immediately. And Christine, I'm so glad you were persistent about this. You know, really took her in multiple time til she was on the right I.V., because any of those outcomes, all those scary diagnoses they were throwing at you, can have devastating outcomes, so really important. And the beauty here, if there is a beauty, is as a parent, you don't need to know how to diagnose Correct. Toxic Shock Syndrome. You need to be able to diagnose \"my kid is sick, and getting sicker, Yeah and needs antibiotics. and this is more than just a localized skin infection.\" And Mom did that. I mean we saw that picture when Gabby was truly sick, and it showed. I mean, she looked like a sick kid, look at her now, looking great. But some of the things in terms of truly differentiating Toxic Shock Syndrome, vis-a-vie the rash that she had, in TSS, one thing we always see is this peeling on the palms and soles, sometimes around the nails, and that's sometimes what differentiates it from some of those other rashes. So it might have been a clue in addition to just the generalized rash. But high fever, feeling lousy, you know, a little bit out of sorts, plus a rash, doesn't matter what it is, needs medical attention for sure. And Gabby now that you're feeling better, and hopefully focused on having a little more fun, Lego Group heard about everything that you've been through. They're giving you one thousand dollars worth of building sets! (applause) Oh my God! That's a lot of building sets! That's a lot of Legos! Gabby, thanks so much for being on the show, and showing us your beautiful smile. Thank you! Christine, thank you so much as well. (applause) Thank you guys. Of course, thank you.",

        "video_title": "Induction of Fever, Control of Body Temperature, Hyperthermia, Animation.",
        "video_sub_title": "Fever, clinically known as pyrexia, is an abnormal increase in body temperature, usually due to an illness. Commonly thought as an undesirable side effect of diseases, fever is actually an effective way the body uses to fight infections. Patients usually recover faster when they allow fever to run its course rather than suppressing it with fever-reducing medications. This is because a higher temperature slows down the growth of most pathogens, as well as boosts the effectiveness of the body\u2019s immune response. It also increases metabolic rates and thereby accelerating tissue repair. Normally, the hypothalamus keeps the body\u2019s temperature within a narrow range around 37 degrees Celsius, or 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. The hypothalamus acts like a thermostat. It receives inputs from heat and cold receptors throughout the body, and activates heating or cooling, accordingly. When the body is too hot, the hypothalamus sends instructions for it to cool down, for example, by producing sweat. On the other hand, when temperature drops, the hypothalamus directs the body to preserve and produce heat, mainly via the release of norepinephrine. Norepinephrine increases heat production in brown adipose tissue and induces vasoconstriction to reduce heat loss. In addition, acetylcholine stimulates the muscles to shiver, converting stored chemical energy into heat. Fever is part of the inflammatory response. When immune cells detect the presence of a pathogen, for example, upon binding to a component of bacterial cell walls, they produce inflammatory cytokines. Some of these cytokines are fever-inducers, or pyrogenic. Pyrogenic cytokines act within the hypothalamus to induce the synthesis of prostaglandin E2, PGE2, the major fever inducer. PGE2 acts on thermoregulatory neurons of the hypothalamus to raise the body\u2019s temperature set point. In other words, PGE2 tricks the hypothalamus into thinking that the body is cold, while in fact the temperature did not change. In response, the hypothalamus instructs the body to actively produce heat to raise body temperature above normal. Fever-reducing medications, such as aspirin and ibuprofen, work by suppressing PGE2 synthesis. Once infection is cleared, pyrogens are no longer produced and the hypothalamic thermostat is set back to normal temperature. Cooling mechanisms, such as sweating and vasodilation, are activated to cool the body down. While fever is usually beneficial and need not be treated, precaution should be taken to prevent body temperature from running too high, which may cause confusion, seizures and irreversible damage to the brain. Finally, it is important to differentiate between fever and hyperthermia, the latter is often caused by extended exposures to extreme heat, or heat stroke. Unlike fever, the body\u2019s temperature set point in hyperthermia is unchanged and the body does not produce the extra heat; its cooling system is simply exhausted and fails to compensate for the excessive external heating. Hyperthermia is always harmful and must be treated with various cooling methods. Fever-reducing medications have no effect on hyperthermia as pyrogens are not involved.",

        "video_title": "How I Change Saras' Mic Key Button (feeding tube)",
        "video_sub_title": "hi everyone this is my daughter Sara and she is 11 years old and she has had a feeding tube for about five and a half years now she has what's called the Mickey tube we just call it the Mickey like Mickey Mouse um and it's time for her feeding tube to be changed and I wanted to do a short video of that because a lot of times in my support groups parents will say my child's getting a feeding tube and I don't know what what does the Mickey look like how does it work they tell me I can change it at home I'm scared to change it is it going to be gross is it going to hurt you know is it hard to do and it's really not that hard I do it myself at home um I choose to do it at home just because her doctor's office is 45 minutes away and by the time we drive there and wait and they change the Mickey button it takes like five minutes and then we got to drive all the way back home so it's just it's not that hard to do and I just choose to do it at home so bear with me and the first thing that you want to do is have your person hi everyone because you haven't seen me have your person lay down on a towel or an under pad and as you can see we've got it under pad here typically you want to wait until about an hour or two after your person has finished eating or drinking anything because you're going to take that mickey button out there's going to be a little hole in the stomach and the fluids that are in the stomach can come right out of that hole in my commits so Sarah hasn't eaten in a couple hours and hopefully there won't be that much of a mess so what I'm going to do first you have to wash your hands really good I've already done that get your supplies together and what you are going to need is a little like medicine cup of water you see a little cup of water there you're going to need the Mickey button replacement pack that you should have already here we go it's just a pack and I've already opened it so you can see it comes with some gauze here which we will need and some extra tubes Mickey buttons some syringes and it's really not as complicated as it looks this is the Mickey button this is what it looks like a brand new one before you put it in and you can see right here this is the button part yeah there we go okay there's the button part and I I think they call it a button I'm not sure but because it's like a little button there and you connect the tubing the food goes right down through that hole there and when you're done eating you just close the little button hole this is the stem and this thing you see here at the bottom this bubble looking thing this is a balloon and you inflate that with water and once it is inflated you know you slide it in the belly and then you inflate it with water it anchors this button in place so that it won't slide right back out of the hole and I'll show you what that looks like when I take the old one out okay so you get your supplies together and you're going to need some KY jelly store-brand is fine it doesn't matter you just want to use KY because it won't break down the material that this balloon is made out of and you'll need the little syringe the six demel syringe out of your pack somebody is getting fuzzy hi not according here okay so let's get everything up here where we need it hey and what you're going to want to do is just pull the shirt up here and you can see what this looks like I'll try to zoom in on go ahead and zoom in on her belly so you can see what I'm doing here okay yet see how the sorry the tube is connected to the button there it already focus again in a minute maybe mm okay there we go let's see it says lock on there what you want to do is take your extension tube off this is the part where the food runs in and goes down into the belly and you want to line up these two lines right here when they're lined up it's unlocked and you can just pop that right out of there see we got a little stuff spewing out of there let's wipe that off cap that now the reason we have this little bitty syringe right here is you're going to take the syringe and put it in the side port right here and you're going to push it in all the way when you push it in all the way you'll feel it when it's pushed in all the way you want to pull back on it and pull back on the syringe right here and it's going to pull the water out of that balloon and deflate it so that we can slide it right out of her belly all right so we're going to hold it push that in as far as we can and we're just going to pull that water right out get as much of it out as you can sometimes it's kind of hard to do but I find that it's easier to roll her over onto her side and do it sometimes but for today's purposes we're just gonna try and do it this way now okay I'm going to roll her over onto her side just because it's easier for me to get all the water out that way all right that's roly poly just allow it you know while I pull just a little bit okay I think that everything's out of there oh there's nothing else coming out now once the balloon is deep deflated you've got to pull this out of the valley here and you can kind of tug him on it and see it's kind of like an earring hole and it's not really hurting it's just she's feeling the pressure of this thing sliding out let's see she's not crying she's not pitching a fit and you just pull it right out there we go and yeah nothing's coming out of her belly so you can see there's the hole where the button was it's not nasty or gross or anything this is we're going to go ahead and put some girls over that just in case something does decide to come out this is the old button and you can see here how yucky and yellow it has gotten because it's been in there so long compared to the nice new clean one that we are going to replace it with see here big difference now I want to read and flight this yellow one here golden just so I can see what one looks like inflated get some water over here now we're going to inflate this again just so you guys can kind of see we in front of the camera there see just inflate in that balloon it's not inflated fully I'm just kind of showing you but do you see kind of how that would anchor into the belly there to keep you from pulling it out and that's some breakdown on the balloon there after a while of it being in there the stomach acids and everything kind of start breaking down the the latex okay so now we need to put yeah we need to put the new balloon yeah gonna toss that over there all right now for the new balloon you want to lube the stem and the balloon part up really well just because it's all dry right now and you Lube it up it's going to slide into that little belly hole so much easier so we are going to add some lip on here it's just regular KY and we add it all over the thinning here just like that a little bit much now move got a little Benny juice move the Gauls and what you want to do is just take this stem all nice and lubed up and again she's not hurting it's just she feels it sliding in there oh and you'll feel it slide right in it's in now all we have to do is put some water right there and flight it again it'll tell you in your papers that you get with your Mickey button how much water to inflate the balloon with it depends on what size button you have but um here we go I start with five emails you just push it all the way in there and slide that water right in hit some flight in that balloon there and then you can just kind of grab it here you can pull on it a little bit and you can see it's not it's not pulling out or anything it's nice and inflated in there snugly you can move it around and that's all there is to it where you're done so as you can see it's not really that hard to do it's not complicated it's not painful you just kind of feel the pressure from it I think she's just aggravated but that's all you do to change a Mickey button um it's not to be taken as medical advice or anything I just wanted to show you guys that that's what you do to change your Mickey button and so maybe that will help ease some new parents fears about changing the button yourself and you don't you don't have to change the button yourself you don't have to but it's good to know how to do it if you have a Mickey button because those buttons can be pulled out Sarah's has been pulled out several times and once that button has been out for an hour they tell you to go to the emergency room and have them put it back in because that hole in the belly will start closing up and they may have to actually make another incision to get the button back in so it's good to know if you're not near a hospital somewhere and the buttons been out for almost an hour it's good to know how to put it back in so just carry your supplies with you everywhere everywhere sara goes I have the supplies with her to put that button back in okay and that's all for today thank you bye",

        "video_title": "Hashimotos Flare Up Symptoms | How to Know if You're Having a Flare",
        "video_sub_title": "- In today's video we're going to talk about Hashimoto's flare up symptoms, how you know it's a Hashimoto's flare and not something else like a cold or flu or something like that. And then also, why medication is not enough. (upbeat music) So Hashimoto's, or Hashimoto's Thyroiditis, is a autoimmune disease of the thyroid. Sometimes when somebody is diagnosed with hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, this also could be rooted in Hashimoto's Thyroiditis. And typically in the U.S. and most first world countries, that's kind of the root cause of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. It's an autoimmune cause but most doctors will diagnose people with hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. The thing about straight glandular hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism is that they tend to have separate symptoms that kind of stay the same. With Hashimoto's however, being autoimmune in nature, you tend to get symptoms kind of from both sides. There'll be hyperthyroid symptoms and hypothyroid symptoms. So I'm going to go over a list of what all these symptoms may be so then you can see if those symptoms match up with what you may be experiencing as well. So with this list, just keep in mind that there may be some symptoms that I am not going to mention, because Hashimoto's has such a long list and so many different things that there are things on here that I may not even know about and that may not have been officially kind of connected with Hashimoto's, but still may be a result of your autoimmune disease. This is in no particular order. The first one is cold hands and feet, which if you've ever experienced that, you may be warm but your hands are just freezing all the time or your feet, no matter how many socks you put on or anything like that. They're just cold. And then in general, intolerance to cold or heat. So you may be cold all the time. Like if you're in 90 degree Hawaii and you are putting on a sweater, that could be an indication of that as well. Hair loss is a very common symptom of Hashimoto's. This can be like hair loss out of your head, on your body, especially if you feel like hair coming out kind of in clumps, more than usual. And then also eyebrows, Hashimoto's patients typically have thinner eyebrows. You can see like mine, for example, I plucked mine in college but they never really came back because of my thyroid issues. Dry hands and feet are very, very typical as well, even if you put on moisturizer or something like that. I have found that eating a higher fat diet does help, but dry hands and skin, skin all over too, tend to be a hallmark of Hashimoto's. Brain fog is a very common symptom of Hashimoto's. And if you're not familiar with that, it's kind of like where you're swimming through the mire, like it's very, very hard to think. Similar to if you've had like a cold, like a sinus infection kind of cold or like a head cold where it's just like you feel kind of like a balloon head, space cadet. Just very hard to think, very hard to come up with answers to questions. It's just one of those things where you just feel slow and mucked down. Along with that, memory loss is very common as well. And this can be just like you walk into a room and you're like, what was I here for? Very common these days with smartphones, you get on your smartphone and you get on Instagram and then you forget exactly why you had to get on your phone in the first place. Just things like that, but then also a hard time recalling names, things, just short term memory, long term memory, it's all like very, very common with Hashimoto's. There's often extreme fatigue that doesn't really lift no matter how much sleep you get. You can get hours, like more than anybody else, 12, 15 hours of sleep, naps and all that, and you're still so tired. That's normal. And then when you actually do get sleep, it can be very restless, tossing and turning, waking up several times throughout the night. And then if you do wake up, you tend to stay up for a couple of hours kind of thing. Another common symptom if you're a woman is either heavy or nonexistent periods, and irregular periods. The very, very heavy ones, like more abnormal than most people kind of things, is a typical symptom that a lot of women experience. Another one are body aches and pains. And this can be like all over body aches, just kind of like muscle cramping things like that, but also joint pain as well. Almost like arthritic kind of pain that comes and goes and sometimes it migrates throughout your body in different places. And this can even extend to things like teeth, cause when I have a Hashi's flare, my teeth hurt. It's the weirdest thing, but it's just one of those things, like so many things can be tied back to that particular disease. And then anxiety or panic attacks, just that feeling of like worry, or I can't handle, like overwhelmed, all of that can really definitely be a symptom of Hashimoto's. I think a lot of people have this in general in life, but when it's a little bit higher than usual, that's when it starts kind of to getting like your thyroid territory where the thyroid is producing that response. Another one is heart palpitations, where your heart kinda of goes fast or maybe skips a beat or something like that. It's very important with this one that you do get checked out by a cardiologist if you do have this, because you want to make sure it's not something else, some other underlying root cause that may be dangerous to you. But a lot of people that do have Hashimoto's experience this on and off throughout the day, in clusters, and it's a pretty normal symptom that a lot of people do have. But again, make sure you do get checked just to make sure. Another one is weight gain or weight loss. It can go either way. Some people experience like an amazing increased appetite. No matter how much they eat, just still continue to need to have food. And other people, they can eat barely anything, and they are gaining weight like crazy. It's not really kind of like an explainable phenomena, except for like inflammation and the autoimmune disease is causing hormones within your body to kind of go wack-a-doo. So yeah, another symptom. You can have depression or just like general numbness, like apathy towards life, towards doing anything. It's just kind of like a very, very level, like just don't really wanna do much. And then along with that are emotional ups and downs like mood swings where you can be feeling fantastic one moment and then down the next moment, and then fantastic again, and things like that. Without like really any logical explanation of why you're feeling that way. Nothing necessarily has to happen for you to have these mood swings. They just kind of happen almost like, you feel like that chemical imbalance kind of way and just like, hmm, ohh, that kind of feeling. And then blood sugar crashes are kind of common as well. This is even if you've cleaned up your diet and you don't eat very many sugars in general. If you do eat a lot of sugar, blood sugar crashes can be quite normal, but this is even people that have cleaned up their diet. They still tend to feel this crash where you have that hangry, irritable, shakiness, if you don't have food for a long period of time, can happen when you have an active Hasimoto's flare going on. Another one is, indicative especially of hyperthyroidism, and Graves Disease, but sometimes can be in a Hashimoto's flare as well, and it's the bulging eyes, where your eyes can protrude. And that's usually indicative of your thyroid producing too much hormone, but it can be a symptom of Hashimoto's. And then you go into the category of things that are general autoimmune issues for most people, no matter what autoimmune disease you have. It's like if your body is fighting against itself, a lot of these next few symptoms will be things that you may experience as well. And one of them is the inability to fight off colds or viruses. You seem to pick up everything that comes by. Like somebody can walk by you, sneeze 20 feet away, and then you get a cold. So that's a pretty normal thing for most people with autoimmune disease, mainly because your immune system isn't working optimally. And the same thing, a lot of people tend to get seasonal allergies as well because the histamine response, your immune system just can not handle trying to fight all of these different fires all at once. A lot of digestive issues can be very common, like gas and bloating, but also constipation or diarrhea. All of these, typically like because with gut bacteria the biome is not necessarily ideal and you may have leaky gut. And so it's probably tied towards like infection, something with your gut bacteria, or the leaky gut is leading to some food intolerances. You can have dizziness or vertigo feeling. That's a pretty common one to have as well. And we did touch about the mood swings before, but irritability especially is one that can happen a lot with autoimmune disease. And then a feeling of like general, just I don't feel well, like malaise. Almost as if you're coming down with something, but nothing ever actually kinda of materializes out of it. You can just feel like, you can get low grade fevers, or just blah, like tiredness, aches and pains and stuff. Almost like it's a very, very low grade fever or virus kind of thing, like a flu. Adrenal fatigue symptoms are also very common, like if you get tired at three o'clock in the afternoon and need some sort of sugar, or something like that to keep you going throughout the day. Very common with autoimmune disease. Adult acne is also a very common one. So fun when you're an adult and you've gotten through that whole teenage stage and you're still getting zits everywhere, ugh! So how do you know, if you're experiencing some or a lot of these symptoms, if it's a flare up of your Hashimoto's, or if it's something else like a cold or a flu. Because sometimes it can get kind of confusing, especially if you are feeling like seasonal allergies at the same time as a general body ache, extreme exhaustion, and stuff like that. I mean I have been doing this for years, and sometimes I still question it as well. Well, one of the first things you can do is just give it some time. If your symptoms last more than like a week or so, then it may probably be more of a Hashimoto's flare rather than an acute little sickness. And then if you really want to be sure, you can do some testing of your thyroid. If you haven't gotten diagnosed already with Hashimoto's and you heard this list, and you're like, that's so me, this may be a way to get diagnosed as well. Typically the testing is how you get diagnosed with Hashimoto's in the first place, but it also can be a way to tell if you are having a flare. So one of the ways that most doctors typically test are for TSH, or thyroid stimulating hormone. And if it is really low or really high, this is indicative of something going wrong with your thyroid. And if you've already been tested, you know you have Hashimoto's and all of that, and if you're already on medication even, if it's high or low that's indicative of something not right with your thyroid and you're most likely in the middle of a flare. The even better way to do this though, is to get your doctor to do a full thyroid panel which includes the TPO, or thyroid peroxidase antibody test, to see whether or not you're producing antibodies. And then also the thyroglobulin antibody test as well. That's usually denoted as TGAb. Sometimes these tests still come back completely normal. Does not still mean that you don't have Hashimoto's. You still may, but there are some other ways that you can test it. You can get an ultrasound of your thyroid. There are needle tests that they can actually draw some cells out and look at things that may be indicative of Hashimoto's. And then if all the tests all come back as negative, or anything like that, I don't if it really even matters, cause at this point you do want to just start to do things that are going to make your autoimmune disease calm down, make your immune system start working optimally, get rid of a lot of the inflammation in your body, all of those kinda of things anyway. Because it doesn't really matter necessarily what it is officially with a diagnosis. I mean, an official diagnosis is nice. However, it's better to start doing activities that will start healing your body in general anyway. We'll talk in the next video about the things that you can start doing to try to start feeling better. And then I want to answer the question of, isn't medication enough. Because if maybe you're on medication for your hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism or Hashimoto's, why are you getting flares? Like why are the medications not helping you? And typically if you're on a medication, like Levothyroxine, Synthroid, Cytomel, Armour Thyroid, any of these that are replacing the thyroid hormone, all that's doing is replacing the thyroid hormone. It's not actually stopping the disease activity behind the scenes. So let me state that again. Your body is fighting against itself. It is producing antibodies against your own tissue, your thyroid tissue, and all the medication does is replace the hormone that your thyroid no longer can create. Our bodies need thyroid hormone. Like every cell in the body needs to have some thyroid hormone to function. And so it's very, very important that if you are taking a medication that you continue to do so, because your body needs to have that hormone. However, it does not mean that your body is no longer attacking itself, it still is. So that's why typically people that only use medication and no dietary or lifestyle interventions still tend to have a lot of bad days and some good days, and kind of go up and down. And also why your medication might fluctuate from month to month to month. In the next video we'll discuss why you may be experiencing your Hashimoto's flare and what to do about it. If you want to know a little bit more about autoimmune disease and why it's happening to you, and all of this, go ahead and watch this video. And then there's a whole bunch of information on my website as well. If you go to thrivingonpaleo.com/start-here there's a whole section on what to do if you just got diagnosed with autoimmune disease, why we have it, all of the things that keep it going, things that we can do to help it, that kind of thing. So you can get kind of a head start by going there, or wait until the next video and then I will go over a lot of that stuff as well. I will see you next time.",

        "video_title": "How to Identify and Correct a Hiatal Hernia: Part 1",
        "video_sub_title": "hi I'm now going to show you how to identify and correct a problem called a hiatal hernia and helping me is Helen from Russia she's visiting America and first thing I want to say is Helen is the typical kind of person who has a problem with the sphere hiatal hernia when when people are tall and slender they usually they're the ones that have this problem the worse although it can happen in anybody and Helen you've had asthma you know and some other health problems right we've been working with this with her a little bit but I want to demonstrate first of all how you how you identify this with muscle response testing so I'm going to push our our I'm going to check our polarity like this and now I'm going to go right here to the solar plexus right here I'm going to hold and you see she's weak there and just demonstrate I'm going to check some of the other things nervous system pituitary lymphatics thyroid thymus lungs blood heart and circulation liver colon colon colon small intestines kidney renal kidney adrenal necessity there's a number of things here at the testing week now what I want to show you is I'm just going to really quickly just flick like that like I'm pulling her stomach down just a little bit and I'm going to retest her hold gyroid lungs lymphatics liver circulation that's a little weak but it's better and this is this is what happens the stomach comes down through an opening in the diaphragm called the hiatus and through with the esophagus and then kind of curls around like this and what happens here is the stomach slides up into the opening in the diaphragm and impedes the movement of the diaphragm it also interferes with suggestion it puts pressure on the heart lessens a person's ability to breathe with their lungs and interferes with their ability to digest food and absorb nutrients so Helen take a deep breath for us I notice how she she breathes up here with her shoulders okay now if I breathe see my shoulders hardly move but the reason that she has this problem is because her stomach is actually in the way and interfering with the movement of her diaphragm so we need to correct this and one of the things that causes this is emotional tension so one of the things you can do to let go of it before you even begin any kind of mechanical thing is to practice throwing a temper tantrum so and this is very hard for people with how to learn to do by the way you hurt your teeth and you clench your fists go like this like you're really mad at somebody and you go taking a deep breath and go ah okay one of the things you notice is notice how that's primarily coming from her throat in other words there's this kind of like constriction here it's really hard for her to do and people who have this problem usually laugh when they do this because I can't because it feels uncomfortable doesn't it yeah so try to get but yeah let it come from down here okay now take a deep breath okay and a lot of times that will loosen it up a little bit but in this case it didn't that takes take some practice to get that to drop down so we're going to do is we're going to switch the camera here for a second and come back and I'm going to show you how to correct this with her lying on the massage table okay so we now have Helen on the massage table so I can demonstrate how to work on this problem of the hiatal hernia and while you can do this through clothes it's actually easier to do it on bare skin so I'm going to just lift your shirt up like this and you see her ribs coming right here and right here and right in between her ribs there's that little soft spot of the solar plexus and this is where you're going to be doing your work now normally I would do this a little harder than I'm going to do it right now but we just got back from lunch and so you can't like really pull hard on the stomach that what are you just eating so but what you do is you start under this side you just kind of gently pull your fingers in here and work your way up to that little spot right there and you'll feel kind of the stomach moving and then you you have the person take a deep breath and hold it and you'll feel you kind of get a hold of the stomach and now exhale hard and you pull down on that area like this only you do it a lot harder than I just did let's do that again take a deep breath and blow it out and pull down you can even just do gently pulling down like this just alternating your hands like so and that will help to open up get that stomach to drop out of the diaphragm a technique I learned from Deanna Hansen a certified athletic therapist in Canada that really helps is also to just do gentle massage on the abdomen just rotating your fingers around and just kind of relaxing the whole abdominal area and just doing this for like five minutes a day and especially paying attention to just kind of massaging right here under the ribcage like so because this actually helps to bring the stomach down now take a deep breath for me okay and what you're looking for relax let go is you want to see movement right here with the stomach and the ribs rising down here instead of so much up here and that tells you that you're getting some progress in opening up breathing and again I'm just going to work on it just a little bit and again take a deep breath and you can see the the movement taking place there what often accompanies this is a problem with the ileocecal valve and the way you locate the allylic valves you find that the point of the hip here and the belly button and net draw an imaginary line between those two and right midway on that line is where you'll find the Elio Segal valve you go just below that with both hands and you push and it's usually a little tender right and you you basically lift up like this and hold it until the tenderness stops okay which actually usually takes two or three minutes but we're not going to spend the amount of time to do that on this DVD and again just even doing this kind of gentle massage will help to get that moving the ileocecal valve is the valve between the small and the large intestines and when it gets inflamed it lets material from the colon come back into the small intestines which causes gas and bloating that pushes up on the stomach you also may need to work on the valve of Houston which is an area of the colon that constricts a lot of gas and basically if you start at the belly button go two inches down one inch to the other side and go straight down and that one is often tender too and people have a hiatal hernia yeah it doesn't build a good doesn't and you hold that again until it stops hurting which usually takes about two minutes okay and oftimes after doing that you'll actually get some additional benefit right here take a deep breath again yeah we got a little better movement that time so Jack Richardson does this really hard he really gets up there with his fingers and gets under the ribcage and literally jerks the stomach down I find that doesn't do very much good because usually the tension created by that makes it go right back the way it was so I find working on it gently every day like this is much more beneficial so that concludes that demonstration we're going to reset the camera and I'm going to show you a couple of self-help techniques that you can do working on this yourself in addition to having someone work on it like I just showed you you",

        "video_title": "How To Check Your Lymph Glands - Melanoma Awareness",
        "video_sub_title": "the aim of this short video is to demonstrate how to check your lymph glands on rare occasions melanoma can spread into the lymphatic system as part of your examination for the lymph nodes these are normally undertaken in the systematic fashion so here is our initial assessment depending on which part of the body the melanoma occurs on will depend on the type of the lymph nodes that you feel so we're going to start off with the head and neck area for examination and so the first area to examine are the ones in front of your ear these are called the pre auricular nodes now the technique is to run your fingers gently over the surface of the skin and a sort of rolling motion and both sides should be compared at the same time another set of glands are found behind the ear these are known as the post pel\u00edcula glands and the same principle applies gently rolling your fingers over the area and what you're looking for is a small mobile lump which is usually not tender the next area to examine is the area underneath the margin of the jaw or jawline these are called the submental glands and again the idea is to work your way from the angle of the jaw all the way around to the chin area in a circular motion feeling for small lumps in that the most important thing to realize is that lymph node enlargement is extremely common particularly with skin infection tonsillitis sore throats ear infections so therefore one of the commonest reasons to come and see your dermatologist is if you have a raised lymph node and you might think it's related to you melanoma more often than not is not related nevertheless it's really important to know what lymph nodes feel like and the best time to assess your skin is straight after your first examination the next area to examine is the neck and neck has quite strong muscles in there these are known as the strap muscles of the neck and the chain of glands just run in front of that strong muscle again you can work your way down the length of the muscle all the way down to the bottom comparing both sides at the same time the next area it's just above the collarbone so you isolate your collarbone and the muscle on the back and in that triangle you feel slightly deeper with some deeper pressing there the area has a lot of fat in it again circular motion feeling for lumps a question that's often asked is how do you know you're feeling a lymph node the best time to feel it straight after the consultant or nurse has seen you and if they've given you the all-clear you know that that's normal skin the final area of the examine on the back of the neck are the occipital nodes they're usually a very small group of nodes at the back here again very common for them to be inflamed or raised particularly with skin infection and the motion is to roll that area under your fingertips so the next area we're going to examine are the glands within the armpit or this is probably the Communists site to examine or have examined during your melanoma follow-ups now essentially the armpit consists of four sides and an apex or peak think of it like a pyramid so I'm outlining as you can see the four walls of this pyramid and then the deep part of it which is the apex of that pyramid right at the peak so as you're standing now the skin is stretched and tight which would make it difficult to assess so it's really important to relax the large muscles in this area before examining now you'll often see the conditions rest the arm on their hands to relax those muscles and we get to feel in a sequential way so it's very important to feel all four areas in a sequence so the way to do at home is to begin to feel the front wall against your chest in a circular motion the back wall in the circular motion far wall where my hand is again the circular motion the superior your wall up against the arm using the arm as the area to rest the lymph nodes onto and then finally really quite deeply into the armpit as far as you can go and again feel that with your fingertips you have to often go quite deep in there so the sequence of events should be the four walls examined and then the apex of the armpit examine obviously you can compare that both sides often during lymph node examination depending on which part of the body is involved the variety of lymph nodes exactly will be different but there are occasions when all the lymph nodes are examined as part of the video we'll be showing how to examine the groin it is often best done with the patient lying flat which relaxes the muscles in the area and the important part of this part of the body is to locate the bony landmarks so the first landmark the field for is the hip bone this is known as the iliac crest but it's essentially the prominent part of your hip bone that you can feel and the second bony landmark will be the pelvic bone or the pelvis so you'll feel that just deepen the growing there and then you need to imagine a line that runs between the hip bone and the pelvic bone this is called the inguinal ligament and these are the inguinal nodes so they roughly run in a chain along that line so small tiny nodes are really really common in this area of the groin has a large amount of bacteria and offered the small glands are up there is also a smaller second chain of glands that just run vertically down the inner part of the thigh just near where it meets with the pelvic bone so running your fingers again in the rolling fashion feeling for small lymph nodes in this direction be part of your examination again it's important to reiterate that the best time to examine your skin and to get to know it is to do this straight after you've had a clinical examination by a professional if they're telling you on that visit that there's nothing to feel of any significance then you know that that part of the skin feels small and therefore you know what's normal and it's important to know what's normal so that you can there was abnormal but final area very small area of the body is this area behind the knee there are small glands present here that very often are not raised but for patients with melanoma that occur below the knee then this is sometimes an area that it's felt now as the patient is standing the skin is extremely tight and therefore not in the right position to feel for glands the right position is with the legs completely relaxed and bent often in the sitting position this relaxes the large muscles or hamstrings across the joint and again it's a question of putting both hands behind the knee rolling the area under your fingertips and feelings of small mobile lumps in that area again it's important to reiterate that small lymph nodes are quite often felt and these are often inconsequential and the area behind the knee drains the foot and the foot often has a large number of infections including athlete's feet ingrowing toenails and all these kind of things can actually cause low-grade lizards so this is just a general summary of all the examinations that we do for lensman's",

        "video_sub_title": "hi I'm dr. David Hill and today we're going to be talking about how to relieve sinus and chest congestion so the most common cause of having sinus and chest congestion together is a viral upper respiratory infection or a cold the good news is that if you wait long enough usually seven to ten days the symptoms are going to get better on their own let me specify the nose gets better first usually within seven to ten days 14 on the outside however the coffin chest congestion may last as long as three weeks in a typical viral infection it doesn't mean that anything's wrong that's just how long it takes to get better now in the meantime you want to know what can you do probably the simplest thing is to put yourself in a humid environment now one thing you can do is just live in the south like I do and then you're already in a humid environment but let's say you have air-conditioning or you lose somewhere that not human you want to add some humidity to your environment you can use a vaporizer either a cool mist or steam vaporizer to make your environment more humid that said a word of caution with the with the hot water vaporizers the steam vaporizers those can be very dangerous especially if there are children around because it's really easy to get steam burned by putting your hand in front of that thing so if you have one make sure it's way out of the reach of children now another thing that you can do is to try and wash the gunk out of your nose and sinuses the easiest way to do this is to use what's called a neti pot this is a little device that looks kind of like a tea pot and kind of like Aladdin's magic lantern you introduce normal saline into the nose using the neti pot you can make your own normal saline by taking one teaspoon of salt in two cups of water you mix that up real good you might heat it up to help it dissolve and then once it's at room temperature you introduce it into the nose while you're hanging out over the sink let it rinse all that stuff around and that will help out some as well now if you have a friend who can pound on your chest gently with a cupped hand that may help bring up some of the chest congestion there is a medication sold called guaifenesin the common brand is mucinex that supposed to help loosen up gunk in your chest to make it easier to cough up whether that really works particularly well remains a matter of some debate but it's something that you can try now if your symptoms have not getting gotten better over a two to three week period you may have a bacterial infection of the sinuses or the lungs and you may want to seek care likewise if this is acting like allergies or asthma perhaps there's a known trigger perhaps it's seasonal perhaps it doesn't get better over a two or three-week period again or you have shortness of breath certainly you want to seek care from a doctor for that talking about how to relieve sinus and chest congestion I'm dr.

        "video_sub_title": "hey guys it's dr. Shah welcome back to my youtube\u00a0 channel so today I wanted to talk about something\u00a0\u00a0 that I think a lot of patients will find very\u00a0 helpful you know obviously my favorite operation\u00a0\u00a0 is rhinoplasty surgery and you'll see a lot of\u00a0 videos about that you'll see me talking about\u00a0\u00a0 rhinoplasty and answering questions on the web\u00a0 about that so one thing that brings brings a lot\u00a0\u00a0 of patients some discomfort after rhinoplasty\u00a0 surgery is the concept of managing the swelling\u00a0\u00a0 that they see in the weeks to months after the\u00a0 topical dorsal splint comes off the nose and I\u00a0\u00a0 think the answer a lot of questions from patients\u00a0 who either are afraid to talk to other surgeons\u00a0\u00a0 or don't feel comfortable talking to their own\u00a0 surgeons who have already done the operation\u00a0\u00a0 so one of the things we do in our office is we\u00a0 have actually a pretty standard regimen that all\u00a0\u00a0 rhinoplasty patients use for about two months\u00a0 after surgery and it involves a combination of\u00a0\u00a0 nasal taping at night when they sleep and then 3\u00a0 times a day soft tissue massage the vast majority\u00a0\u00a0 of the nasal swelling is gone in the first\u00a0 several months after surgery but literature\u00a0\u00a0 and research has shown that even by one year is\u00a0 a minuscule amount of swelling in the nose so\u00a0\u00a0 one of the things patients can do is control\u00a0 that swelling through behavior modification\u00a0\u00a0 adjustments to diet alcohol and salt intake and\u00a0 so what we can do is teach you how to take care\u00a0\u00a0 of your nose and the two things that patients\u00a0 can do I think that do the greatest amount of\u00a0\u00a0 good would be nighttime taping in three times\u00a0 a day soft tissue massage so I love to use a\u00a0\u00a0 product called the 3m mic report tape and\u00a0 it looks like this this is the box that your\u00a0\u00a0 doctor would necessarily show you I don't know\u00a0 if you can see it with the light but there you\u00a0\u00a0 go and it looks like this it's a small very\u00a0 like almost I don't know maybe a half inch\u00a0\u00a0 type of brown paper tape and it works great\u00a0 it hides really nicely on all types of skin\u00a0\u00a0 and you wear it at night when you sleep and it\u00a0 comes off in the morning in the shower so what\u00a0\u00a0 I tell patients to do is to tape like this so\u00a0 this part of the nose is known as the tip and\u00a0\u00a0 right above it is what they call this super tip\u00a0 and it's a great place where people can if they\u00a0\u00a0 can reduce the swelling in this space it allows\u00a0 for really nice shaping of the tip so what I do\u00a0\u00a0 is this I have patients put in a little piece of\u00a0 tape right here over the super tip and they do\u00a0\u00a0 this at night and they may do a few more pieces of\u00a0 tape with a little tiny bit of overlap like this and finally this last piece of tape up here at\u00a0 the radix comes in and gets that last piece of\u00a0\u00a0 tipping so what it does is it acts like a little\u00a0 ice wrap and it just holds the tissues down when\u00a0\u00a0 you sleep flat at night after the first week or\u00a0 whenever your surgeon tells you you can sleep flat\u00a0\u00a0 all that blood pressure equalizes between your\u00a0 toes and your head and a lot of blood cancer you\u00a0\u00a0 know flow into the face and so in the morning\u00a0 some people who don't do this recognize that\u00a0\u00a0 their noses are actually much more soul than\u00a0 they are at the end of the day before they've\u00a0\u00a0 gone to sleep and so it's nice to be able to\u00a0 feel like you've controlled some that swelling\u00a0\u00a0 at night so this is what I tell my patients to\u00a0 do at night go ahead and put the nighttime tape\u00a0\u00a0 on and then we do soft tissue massage and of\u00a0 course I'm sure you've seen these before these\u00a0\u00a0 are tongue depressors they make great little\u00a0 molding devices you know even though there's not\u00a0\u00a0 a lot of swelling after one week there's still\u00a0 stuff there and you can feel it to get squishy\u00a0\u00a0 here and it's often very firm at the nose and\u00a0 the nasal bones are tender and so you do things\u00a0\u00a0 to make that move along and one thing that we do\u00a0 we have a basically a three-step exercise that I\u00a0\u00a0 tell patients to do for one minute per step at\u00a0 breakfast lunch and dinner so it's nine minutes\u00a0\u00a0 total in a day and the first thing we do is\u00a0 have people take just the flat side of this\u00a0\u00a0 tongue depressor and just gently press down\u00a0 very lightly to exercise lymphatic drainage\u00a0\u00a0 and basically glue the skin nicely down to the\u00a0 cartilage and bone framework of the nose that's\u00a0\u00a0 the exercise for one minute there then the next\u00a0 one is nasal sidewall shaping and so you want to\u00a0\u00a0 come into a mirror and make sure these are nice\u00a0 and straight like this and then you just gently\u00a0\u00a0 press in one two in a very pulsatile motion and\u00a0 what that does is it basically tells the side\u00a0\u00a0 nasal bones that have been broken to heal and it\u00a0 controls sidewall swelling and sometimes you can\u00a0\u00a0 come in and get the tip this way with that but\u00a0 we can save the tip as the third part so the\u00a0\u00a0 third step is basically tip management and that\u00a0 would be things like side compression of the tip vertical compression of the tip and just mold it\u00a0 so if your nose if you think of your nose as the\u00a0\u00a0 lump of clay that's almost perfect it's that last\u00a0 little bit of styling and last bit of contouring\u00a0\u00a0 that you're doing it's no different than how you\u00a0 design your contouring makeup for your nose but it\u00a0\u00a0 basically allows you to manage this swelling\u00a0 this way the swelling on the nasal sidewalls\u00a0\u00a0 and again you want to keep these as straight as\u00a0 you possibly can and so keeping a nice straight\u00a0\u00a0 line between you know as seen in the mirror works\u00a0 really well and then of course you know molding\u00a0\u00a0 the sides of their nose so that's how we manage\u00a0 nasal swelling after surgery and patients have\u00a0\u00a0 found it to be very very effective it gives you a\u00a0 little bit of control and you're out outcome and\u00a0\u00a0 you don't feel so helpless watching the swelling\u00a0 go up and down and up and down as you exercise\u00a0\u00a0 or eat nachos or drink some beer or whatever it\u00a0 is in your life or go to the gym bump up your\u00a0\u00a0 heart rate for an hour and then wonder why your\u00a0 nose is pounding at the end of the day so it's\u00a0\u00a0 little things like this that will help control\u00a0 your nose and slowly get that ebb and flow of\u00a0\u00a0 swelling to settle down and become basically your\u00a0 normal nose and again it's about a year so being\u00a0\u00a0 patients important we just have people do this\u00a0 for the first two months after surgery and they're\u00a0\u00a0 good so stay tuned for more tips and tricks and\u00a0 plastic surgery but as you know rhinoplasty is my\u00a0\u00a0 favorite thing and so nice talking to you and\u00a0 hopefully we'll put up some more videos soon",

Wood what exactly is glucagon Luca GaN is a medication that we use in people with diabetes when they're having a severe low blood glucose and is it this the stuff that you shoot in you that's not that's not sugar no and one of my former patients used to call it the glucose gun instead of glucagon but no it's not glucose it's a synthetic version of the natural hormone that our body makes can you demonstrate to me how that's work sure you want to do it with me all right the good thing about glucagon is that it's a very safe medication and you really cannot hurt somebody with glucagon even if you gave more than the recommended dose for example for a child it's not going to hurt them so the first thing that you do is you take the vial out and it has a disc of powder and you take the cap off take the syringe and take the cap off inject the liquid into the vial of powder and you want to mix you shake it up like that until the powder is completely dissolved and the liquid is back to clear and then keeping the syringe back in the vial you want to pull the liquid back into your syringe and your dose will depend on your age and your body weight flick it a couple times to get your bubbles out and then inject the air back into the vial so you don't have the bubbles you take it out and then it can be given under the skin or an emergency situation we recommend directly into the muscle because it's probably absorbed a little bit faster grab the skin gently like this insert the needle all the way down to the hub and then in Jack out you'd count to three so that all of the liquid has a chance to leave the needle and then pull out you",

        "video_sub_title": "hi everyone its Jessica again and welcome to critic there are several ways in which hypercalcemia occurs my video on hypocalcemia takes the more pathophysiological approach but I've chosen a different route for this video for simplicity so make sure to watch my previous video as well let's flip the switch in this video and start with treatment because the workup isn't that relevant in the acute setting let's get started when you encounter a patient with hypercalcemia check the serum levels corrected for albumin and check for symptoms symptoms include polyuria polydipsia nausea vomiting constipation upper abdominal pain kidney stones confusion and lethargy in their physical examination you typically see a dehydrated patient with muscle weakness and hyper reflection this dehydrated state is caused by a hypercalcemia induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus in which the mechanism isn't completely understood so in short a patient with hypercalcemia is typically a dehydrated confused patient with constipation get an ECG to check for abnormalities especially shortening of the QT interval if your patient is asymptomatic and only has mildly elevated levels of under 3 millimoles per liter they do not require treatment per se if your patient has levels higher than that they require a large amount of IV fluids ie hyper hydration start with normal saline at 200 to 300 cc's per hour and aim for a urine production of 100 to 150 cc's per hour so give them a urine catheter some physicians add a loop diuretic to enhance calcium excretion but this is now only advised in patients prone to heart failure if your patient is symptomatic or if levels are over three and a half milliliter get that calcium back into bone by giving a bisphosphonate like pamidronate 60 to 90 milligrams or Zolo donate four milligrams note that in severe renal impairment bisphosphonates are contraindicated and an osa map 60 milligrams subcutaneous is preferred in extreme cases calcitonin four units per kilogram can be given to promote renal calcium excretion and it also inhibits osteoclast resorption the efficacy of calcitonin is limited to the first 48 hours even with repeated doses indicating tachyphylaxis which is why it is reserved for only the most severe cases for the workup of hypercalcemia i want you to remember these seven groups sorry I couldn't get them into a nice mnemonic PTH vitamin D cancer bone meds immobilization and no crime for the workup of hypercalcemia you first check PTH levels if it's increased the cause of hypercalcemia is primary hyperparathyroidism when the parathyroid gland over produces PTH if PTH is low you check vitamin D levels both active vitamin D also known as Cal C trial or 1.25 D and its inactive precursor also known as Cal C dial or 25 D which is generated by the liver from Cola Kelsey Farrell increased calcium levels is indicative of increased dietary intake so check supplements increased Kelsey trial levels should trigger you to think of extra renal production in granulomatous diseases or lymphoma or increase real production that can be induced by primary hyperparathyroidism if PTH is low you also need to check serum levels of PTH related protein if you encounter a patient with hypercalcemia due to increased PTH related protein find the cancer as this protein is over produced in certain types of cancer notably lung cancer and breast cancer non-hodgkins lymphoma chronic myeloid leukemia and adults T cell leukemia lymphoma bone cancer skeletal metastasis or multiple myeloma caused hypercalcemia for now obvious reasons so find the darn cancer so you can treat it several meds can cause hypercalcemia the most important ones being thiazide diuretics lithium calcium supplements next up is immobilization when someone has been bedridden for a longer period of time osteoclasts will trump osteoblasts and calcium will be released from bone and last but not least several endocrine disorders other than hyperparathyroidism can cause hypercalcemia as well like hyperthyroidism pheochromocytoma and adrenal insufficiency and that's all on hypercalcemia be sure to watch my other videos on calcium to get a more complete overview if you like this video help me out by sharing it thank you so much",

        "video_title": "Storing Winter Clothes",
        "video_sub_title": "hey guys so today well today and tomorrow to be honest I'm gonna be filming partiz tomorrow because I'm packing up our winter stuff at our family vacation home in Utah and I have to do laundry to pack the rest of the winter stuff so I'm just packing the ski stuff today but I wanted to show you what I do to pack up winter stuff so that's why I'm going to be filming over the course of two days this really isn't a long proper process at all it's just a matter of timing where we're leaving um so I'm gonna be wearing something different in the other segments but bare with anyway um like I mentioned in a previous video my closet at home back in it you know the Midwest is very large and I do not need to put away my winter items into storage or summer items you know I don't need to pack things seasonally because I have enough room to keep it out year-round and you'll see all that when I do my master closet upheaval which will be coming up in the coming months but um you know it is an important thing that many people have to do be for lack of space um and so I just wanted to show you what I do at our home in Utah you know it's my husband's parents second home yes but they're very kind and let us use it whatever we want when they're not here and we're here just for a little weekend like February weekend getaway and the next time we're coming is late April and there's obviously not going to be skiing in a late April well there could be but we're not going to be skiing late April I would find that highly unlikely anyway and we're probably going to not need like winter jackets and and sweaters and things like that um this area can get very chilly in the summer and spring and night in the morning so I'm not packing like everything that made you might necessarily pack in a different part of the country of the world for winter storage but this just general idea of what I do here and what I might do at home if I had to so I brought from home these cedar blocks in different sizes and these are lavender scented I just stood there my smelling I like the smell of the cedar blocks like the original smell anyway but I got fought a package which came with five of these drawer sized ones lavender cedar to put in bins specifically that don't have a lot of wool in them but just the I bought them to put in every bin basically that I put winter stuffing and then I bought two packages of these little block size ones to like put in between wool sweaters and cashmere sweaters things that I'm particularly wanna keep protected from moths damage I mean that's the reason has that so moths are deterred from this scent and they won't eat holes in your clothes and then I bought two of these hanging ones it's still in the package but you can see with pencil hanger it just screws in the top there's already a pre-drilled hole and I will hang these in the closet because I do leave some flannels and things out that we're not here a whole buncha I just I feel better if there's some thumb layer of protection so that's what I thought about all you see to the Container Store my favorite place and I'm just going to start today before I do the laundry to show you how I'm packing up our ski stuff now I know people might not have ski stuff to pack up but this really goes for any winter things um lots of people wear long johns in the winter and thick wool socks and scarves and mittens and you know Pat's and sweatpants and things of that nature so this is very similar now there's not a lot of wool things this is mostly cotton and synthetic materials so I'm just going to put one um dror cedar liner and the bottom of each bin and I'll show you here you look at what I did okay so I have two bins one for me gents key stuff you can see that right there and one for dawn dawn ski stuff and that's enough room for our main things I'll sometimes leave our depend you know what we have two that we use for skiing changes sometimes I'll take things home or bring new things whatever and depending on how much room there is the bin I may or may not be able to fit our helmets in and I may or may not be able to fit our ski coats in I usually always set my ski coat in there it is it's already in the bin because my clothes are obviously smaller than my husband's and he wears his ski jacket here as his winter jacket here whereas I have a different winter jacket that has nothing to do a skiing for here so sometimes I put those in different bids or just hanging them in the closet but basically you see I've everything's clean and thoroughly dry and I've just nicely folded everything by category so pants and long johns and then those are sweatshirts and undershirts and same for me and then also in the phone we have all of our like accessories so scarves hats gloves Turtles socks gobbles helmets and what I'm going to do is I'm going to layer the things in the bins making sure there's plenty of room for the lid to shut with my cedar planks on the bottom and I will do that right now and I would like to see my husband Stan my trusty lavender scented cedar plank I'm just going to put it kind of smack dab in the middle just like that and you want to mess myspace anytime to put anything in the bin but I folded things for that with that purpose in mind I'm just gonna go about trying to fill all the spaces as efficiently as possible so you can see how easy that was forty filled half the bin and everything's nicely compact but it's not like smooshed in there so looks like I'm gonna have some room okay so that's all of his things that looks like I have room for his helmet and not his coat this year which is fine I could probably actually fit as coat in on top but we're still here for another day but everything fits nicely voila it's not you know things aren't shoved in there I don't recommend overfilling winter storage bins when you have them off protection in them because just another way for a moth to get in kind of um you know said point so that's that one and now I will swing this mount and I mean this is taking like a second to - you guys can see that okay now I'm on to my he's tough Jansky stuff I already start my co in there so I'll just take that out and put my cedar plank in these are the insults to our ski boots we have custom insoles for our season so I just save these always save stuff like that like even with tennis shoes if you have custom orthotics for your sneakers or even ones that you buy at the store always save the original ones you never know those are some bottom I'm gonna go ahead okay sure I can fit all mine let's redraw my socks oh nice neat I always have a bunch of hammers and foot warmers on hand always on here because I get very poor circulation in my extremities and I don't want to have to run out without those now let's see put my tops in my clothes see are much smaller than his so they don't take up as much room the his being my husband's so my little tiny spandex tights that I'm just double folding to max in my space a little ski belt and I have from my heart my ski pants these are lighter ski pant and I'm just folding them in thirds so they again for maximizing space the smells you can see my helmet and my goggles to further protect the goggles I like to store them in the helmet goggles are expensive and they should last you a really long time there's no need to buy goggles all the time good beer goggles and I think yeah that's a little taller than I want to be so ok readjust I think I'm going to put this right down make sure is gonna close and now you can see everything's in there nice and neat clean and for storage and it does closed very nicely all the way so that's my ski storage my ski stuff storage and when I come back tomorrow I'll show you my like regular clothes storage very similar concept I just use more of those cedar blocks I forgot to mention but I decided to put another one of these long Sleater box the English cedar blocks on top of the box I show there's one on the bottom but I've decided to put one on top of each of our ski stuff boxes just to kind of sandwich the thetour effect in and make sure you know everything's in good shape when next winter when we come back to ski and there's no holes in anything ok so I store all of our winter food sleep in as well you say well says Jen winter coats boots and shoes that's not quite true anymore it's Jen and Dawn's winter boots and shoes so I'll exchange that that's because you're like huge I had to keep the in the bin I make sure I wash the soles and if there's any mud on them you know I washed the other parts of the boots first but I just think it keeps it here I'm gonna go ahead and play around with the arrange see I've already put in Dawn's huge pair of boots and then two pairs of mine so that's a good start I have my bugs these are little juicy slippers and because the odds are lined and chillin I'm going to put in one of those cedar planks just think good idea you have shearling or wool or anything then he's just winning these are our winter slippers make sure upside-down I think to maximize space like I said before I want the fins closed all the way now of course in this case I do put a bin on top of this home so it's okay it actually does close all the way now you have it all of our winter boots and one bin ready for next winter clean and stored I'm back today with all of our clean which are close as I laundry yesterday and put them in the bins now this bin labelled Jen and Dawn winter this is for our winter coats that aren't ski coats and I washed the ones that needed washing you know you should wash you winter coats on someone at least once the ear I would imagine but um since they're rather big and ugly I can't really fit a whole lot in here very sweet so I we wear the winter I did these some gloves and a light scarf out cuts destined to get chilly here in the spring the summer like I mentioned and again since I'm putting some wool items in there I'm gonna stick just one of these will see your box thinks it's really just for the mixes and the hat so I don't think I get big one I think the coat lady push down real nice and these are stocking set Christmas Eve done closed oh I don't know if this is true for all men but at least here at our vacation home I have a lot of winter specific clothes of our husband really doesn't and I do have a bin for him sometimes we have guests stay in this house and I put all of our clothes away and bins so that the closet and drawers are free but he only has two little things a sweater and a Christmas t-shirt so I'm just gonna put them in my bin because they'll fit and it's silly to put like one thing in a bin but I'll know that they're there so here I just have my eyelet see there's my husband's two things I mentioned put those in first and then you have my sweaters and these are cashmere and wool so I'm going to put little blocks around the bottom these are the still see your blocks just keep things safe then I have my flannels and winter specific or holiday t-shirts as well as these are flannel eyed pants love those since the Jonah pants and then these are little fun Christmas t-shirts and I made sure everything is clean obviously but I folded everything nice and laid it all out like you saw before I put in the bins I just like to visualize everything before it goes in and then I have super soft which are too hot to wear in the summer types and then these are cashmere socks that I have I have the same ones both here and at home because I like them so much and I think I mentioned I have poor circulation in my extremities so that just helps keep me nice and warm all right so that's all my socks and then Christmas up and again since I put more wall on the top I'm just going to put a few more these little feeder blocks in ruff just enough come home with me and that's it I'm going to put everything up in the closet I'll give you a quick look and that's how I pack away our winter clothes yes that's how I pack aware what's your clothes ok so in our closet and our bedroom in Utah here you can see em I'm Samardzija Paul my husband's clothes because we don't have a lot of room in our room for dressers so I just keep them on shelves in here but um I have some things hanging these are things that we wear year-round so I don't put them away on the bottom here I have that boot box that I showed that's a box of stuff for my dog um and then I keep our winter clothes stored up top um normally I wouldn't like it bins are hanging over the edge but since it's at the very top of a closet it just really maximizes space I think that's all right so those are our ski clothes pins and our winter clothes and jackets and that's it that's how I store my winter things how do you store your winter things I'm curious to know thanks for watching",

        "video_sub_title": "hey everyone Jessica bassy here today's tutorial is going to be how to whiten teeth now I've read a bunch of comments on other tutorials about how people are very confused by the tutorials and they just want something very simple to follow I'm going to try to make this tutorial very simple now here's an after and that's before so again it this is literally like two layers hopefully I can make this as simple as possible so let's begin now the first thing you want to do is actually select the teeth now I always start out with a duplicate background layer so go to command J and it will duplicate the layer for you now we want to go over to the magic wand tool right here and this is going to help with our selection so you want to select only the teeth so if you simply click anywhere and you can see that some of the teeth have been selected so holding the shift button so I'm holding shift see how that little plus sign comes up if I'm holding shift it means that I'm adding a selection on to the current selection so I'm going to press the other teeth and this isn't going to be a perfect selection by the way but as you can see there's like a little bit over here that I missed so let's say it misses some teeth what you want to do is press the Q button on your keyboard it changes everything into a quickmask so don't get scared and all says this looks really like intimidating but this is just a quick mask so go to your brush tool and we are going to by using we're using a white color by the way and make sure you pull that hardness up so that it doesn't become fuzzy so let's all you want to do is just complete your selection by selecting the other teeth and this doesn't have to be perfect I mean okay maybe it does but when you're doing it but for the sake of this tutorial I'm just going to try to do as best as I can so I'm when my coloring skills are really on point today okay so I think that's pretty good so now that I finalize my selection all you have to do is press Q again and it goes back into a selection pretty easy right now go to image adjustments and then we're going to go to hue and saturation now you're going to first want to change it from master to yellows because we are trying to get rid of the yellow so by lowering the saturation you can see that's getting rid of all that yellow color so but we don't want it to look too fake so I wouldn't like go all the way to you know don't get too crazy because you don't want it to look fake so if I like you know pull up the lightness just a tiny bit you can already see that difference so I'm going to just make sure this is what I want I'm going to press ok the very last thing that we're going to do we're just going to add a little bit of brightness to this go to layer new adjustment layer and then curves now we're going to make sure that the selection was still active so as you can see it only selected our selection hopefully I didn't confuse anyone so this means that anything I do will only affect that selection that you just made which is what we want we don't want it to affect the rest of the picture so again very subtle we just want to move these curves up just a tiny bit and there you go I mean it really doesn't get more simpler than that as far as whitening teeth go play around with again hue/saturation curves but don't get too crazy and make sure that the curves are on eclipsed masking layer that only apply to the selection so that like if this wasn't on a selection this is what would happen like the rest of the picture would be all white I mean if you if you don't mind it being the whole picture being brand but anyways um hopefully I explained this pretty well please let me know if you have any at all and thank you so much for watching",

        "video_sub_title": "every nervous okay hello everybody welcome back to another tested Tuesday today I've got a product that I've been really excited to trial and to show you guys and this product is potentially gonna help make my beard look thicker a lot further it also give me a nice clean the line down the side this brand is topic hair fibers this is their little travel kit like order from Amazon of course something will be down below now these fibers are colored fibers I've ordered the black because I've got black hair but they come in loads of different colors they're little fibers that attach themselves onto your hair to make your hair look thicker and fuller really have high expectations for this the reason I chose topic is because I've seen them all over Instagram being used by barbers you know and to get that really crisp fine line which I'm not a fan of by I'm a fan of thicker looking hair on the side so okay so here we have the hair building fibers I got them in jet black okay so just take off the plastic film this is supposed to make the application of the hairs a lot easier okay you then screw this on hi guys okay so here we are on my face so what we're going to do is spray this all around here and then like in the barber videos we're gonna use a clean blade to like tidy up and really get that fine line in so yeah here we go I'm guessing I just spray this everybody nervous oh okay wow it's going on very patchy as you can see and what if I hold it forever away it smells like smoke machine at a disco you can physically see where I'm spraying it like it's very an obvious must say though some going on very easily it's brie dot best to talk while I'm doing this there's a lot of fire you bet in the air at the moment now it looks very patchy it's a bit everywhere but what I did see in the video is they combed it through so ngrep gonna grab a comb it really quick and just see if we can get this looking a bit more natural because it's kind of looking like a fake beard at the moment it looks like I stuck it on okay so have my little moustache comb moustache this look does not suit me at all okay so as you can see like I haven't quite got the line right and it looks a little bit patchy where I started spraying it really really close so let's try let's try the other side I'm gonna hold it further away so that kind of gives an even coverage and hopefully doesn't attach onto my skin that's a lot better so I'm holding it like here now I feel like that's a lot better I kind of went wrong here but as you can see on here I filled in this kind of like patchy bit that I have here and I don't feel like it looks that real I think keeping it a little bit of patchiness is gonna kind of make it look a lot more convincing not it it's just taking a lot of practice to get to work out how to do the coverage if that makes sense like where you need to hold it how many sprays you need if that makes sense so yeah let's try shaking it up a bit now can't tell where my actual facial hair is now oh right let's ignore what's going on in my ear and on my cheek where I've definitely over sprayed it the coverage is pretty good like it's definitely it's definitely filled in quite a few gaps okay I'm gonna go and get like her face wipe and just kinds Heidi everything up yeah so I don't think this is the most flattering look on myself it makes my cheeks look really big like so I don't have the shape before this kind of like you know fine line beard going on they do give you a natural comb but what I think I'm gonna do when this video goes live is I'm gonna I got a snapchat and Instagram stories how if this comb is any better as far as the actual fibers go what they are really really good they attach them to the hair they make it look a lot thicker there is a technique behind it they obviously haven't figured out yet it is actually a really decent product it's just gonna take a lot of time to kind of get used to and figure out how to use properly and how it's not like an art form you know like where to spray and how to spray it they were actually look fibers kind of like all around this area all on my nose I was like a fine black covering which I did have to wipe off and that would annoy me after doing my whole skincare routine and then going in and doing the fibers that would really really annoy me so yeah also in the videos they do have kind of like a guide so the are doing that if that makes sense so that's a good idea that I should have done it does also kogas setting spray to keep the fibers in place which I'm not gonna spray on my skin because I'm not sure how much gonna react to it yeah I actually I do think is a really decent product this would be great for your hair as well if you are thinning in certain places yeah it's just kind of getting the right technique and the right way of use the screw top puff thing applicator I think is a genius idea is very very good for like ease of application so with all that in mind I think I'm gonna give this four and a half stars out of five because it's good it's just gonna take practice as I keep saying like everything in life takes a bit of getting used to a bit of practice I personally will not be using this product because I hate this look on me so yeah I'm glad that went well wish I think that went well but yeah let me know if you use hair fibers it doesn't happy topic let me know if you use any on your facial hair any tips that you might have in regards you know shaping it up properly and as always make sure you subscribe to my channel and leave your comments down below I'll try to answer them within like the first 24 hours of the post in the video but yeah that is it for this week guys I will see you next time

        "video_title": "Parallettes Workouts - What beginners need to know",
        "video_sub_title": "- Hey, I'm Ryan from GMB Fitness. In this video series I'll be covering everything paralettes. Be covering topics such as the benefits of p-bars, looking at difference in height of the p-bars, in material of the p-bars. Also be looking at a full routine that you can use that covers bent arm as well as straight arm exercises and a whole lot more. Alright, let's get into it. Parallettes are a great tool to help you build really solid upper body and core strength. Now, something that I really like about the parallettes and using the parallettes is that it's a bit easier on the wrists. So if you're having wrist problems when you're performing push ups, hand stands or anything else on the floor, you can take those movements to the p-bars. And because of the angle of the wrist, when using the p-bars, it helps to alleviate a bit of that pain and allows you to continue working on those particular movements. Now, something else is they're fun. It's an alternative to just doing a particular movement. As well, it can be a good stepping stone going from movements from the floor and working up to the rings. Because of the stability of the p-bars, it allows you to practice certain movements, going deeper in those movements before you then move on to the rings. Two common questions that are received regarding the p-bars is what is the best height of the p-bars and what material of the p-bars should I be using? For example wood, pvc or metal. Now to address the first question, in a perfect world, you could have two sets of p-bars; one that is low and one that is higher. Now, they both have benefits. For example, in the beginning when you're working with p-bars that are higher up off of the ground, the movements will be easier. Lets say that you're working on a L-sit. When working on the tuck position, because you're higher up in the air, it's gonna allow yourself to pull your feet back. It's gonna make that movement easier. As well, when you're learning new movements where you're having to pull your body from the front of the p-bars to the back of the p-bars, simply gonna be easier because you have more clearance. Makes sense, right? Cool thing though, about having higher p-bars is when you start working on some of the more advanced movements, say the handstand pushup, because they're higher it's gonna allow you to drop your head further in between the p-bars making it more difficult. Making the movement more difficult. Now likewise, if you have a set of low p-bars, as you get better, taking things to the ground is gonna force you to compress your body more therefore further strengthening the core. So, the best set of p-bars to be honest is really whatever you have in the very beginning but then as you get better, making adjustments and then possibly buying a set of higher p-bars or lower p-bars depending on what you wanna work on. Now to address the next question, what is the best material to use for the p-bars? Well first off, I would like to say that I believe that for parallette work, parallettes are the best thing to use. In other words, a set of kettle bells, or dumb bells, I personally don't think are very good. The reason why? They're not stable at all. Heaven forbid you use those, lose your balance, fall on your head, break your neck. We don't want that. So, first and foremost, if you're doing a lot of parallette work, I suggest purchasing a pair of parallettes. These parallettes are actually bamboo. Our good friend Dusty makes these. They're P-Barz, with a zee. These are actually custom built for me. I'm beta testing some of these but doesn't mean that you have to have these. Anything will work. I prefer wood. The reason why is over time the natural oils in your hand seep in to the wood making the grip even better; therefore you're not going to be slipping. Metal is perfectly fine as well as PVC, again, it's kind of a personal preference. I do suggest though, if you're using metal or if you're using PVC just to make sure that the grip is solid on there. So for example, something that you can do is take tennis tape or even athletic tape, wrap that in order to make sure that you're not slipping off of that. Again, this is a personal preference regarding height as well as material. Let's take a look at how to set the width of the parallettes as well as the hand placement when performing movements. Now, there's three settings that you can use and I got this from way back when I was in gymnastics. This is how we would set up the p-bars whenever we needed to perform our routines. It's very, very simple. What we're gonna do is we're gonna take our elbow and measure out to our wrist, our knuckles or the fingers. The width is gonna depend on your personal preference. If you're looking for more of a narrow setting for your p-bars, you'll place your elbow to the inside and then set it up to about the start of the wrist. So basically where my watch is right now. This is pretty narrow, pretty narrow. Now the other option is simply just to move this out so that it's at the top of your fist. This is my personal preference. This is what I like to use but that's just me, okay? Also, by the way, make sure that your arm is straight across and not at an angle. That will mess up your p-bars. The final one is simply extending the fingers. This is a very wide position for the parallettes. It's up to you; again, my personal preference though in the very beginning, if you just wanna try this one out is to make the fist, go from the elbow right to the top of the fist. It's a good general place to start off. Now lets take a look at hand placement. This is a big one. Make sure that you're using this. You're gonna find that it's gonna help tremendously and also just make it a lot easier on the wrist when you do this. So, very simple, all you're gonna do is start off making sure that your shoulder is over your wrist. This is very straight. The way to do this is to simply place your thumb on the top of the p-bar so that it's facing forward. Now notice that my wrist is not turning outward or dropping. Nor is it dropping to the inside. We don't want that at all. So by placing the thumb on top of the p-bars, then you'll notice that you have this straight line. Now its just a matter of wrapping the fingers and wrapping the thumb, keeping that position with the wrist. This is a very good habit to get in to when you're setting up for the p-bars. Very beginning, placing the thumb on top of the p-bars, wrapping the fingers and then wrapping the thumb before you're setting up for your movements. Pretty simple but a big one for wrist health. Alright, next up, we're gonna take a look at a full routine that you can use to train all the movements using the five-p framework.",

        "video_sub_title": "[Music] hi everybody hope you're having an awesome day today I'm so excited to be filming today because it's the first video that I've done post off so say hello to the girls I haven't named them yet so I am open to name suggestions down below in the comments all jokes aside I'll be posting my TV talk video or my boob job vlog journey video on my vlog channel tomorrow I'll leave a link down to that vlog channel make sure you subscribe so you don't miss out today's video I wanted to talk about keratin bonded extensions and I've never done a video on this and I don't really know why I've had these extensions for two years now and I love them to bits and I could not recommend them more but I really want to tell you a lot of in-depth things about them and I also want to answer some of your questions to clear up a lot of misconceptions that permanent extensions seem to have so I'm not 100% sure on the science behind it but from what I understand keratin is a protein that your hair is made up of and each one of my little extension bonds is glued to my actual hair with that keratin protein so you can see one individual strand my hair has been attached here and there's a bond here and there's extension right here with my actual hair in there as well this is what the bonds look like they're individually placed every so often and each individual bond looks like that and it's attached to that much hair so that is what it looks like if you're wondering how these bonds are applied I have a video gonna link right up here of the first time that I ever got these put in so my hair was really bleach damaged it was short and it was quite brittle and as you can see my own natural hair has grown so much since that time majority of it sits right at the top of my boobs so to start off the questions I want to address the main question that I always get about these type of extensions do they damage your hair it's like anything else if you take good care of it it's not gonna break it's not going to get damaged and you're not gonna have a problem with it for some reason people tend to forget that a lot of the time when people get extensions or they get blown hair or they get a boob job they think that that's that you know once it's in it's done but that's not the truth aftercare is so so important if you want it to last if you want to look good and if you want it to be how your stylist or your surgeon or your colorist want to be you have to do your aftercare typically a salon can choose from so many different options when it comes to hair extensions but if it's a reputable salon there will always choose remy hair what remy hair is is hair that's considered to be in the best possible condition the cuticle is kept intact and it's all running the same direction so it's smooth it's shiny and feels soft and it's strong the benefit of remy hair is that it'll be better conditioned throughout its entire lifetime compared to any other type of hair so it'll be shinier and they'll have less tangles stuff like that your hair also has an ethnicity and I know that that sounds crazy but if it's real hair it has to be girl in somewhere right so I use European hair and the reason why I use European hair over something like Indian or Asian hair is because European hair is a lot not thinner but it's not as thick in his course so my own natural hair is quite thin and it's really really small strand hair it's not think it's not coarse and if I got extensions that were thick and coarse it wouldn't mesh with my hair it wouldn't look proper it just wouldn't look like my hair it would look like somebody else's hair attached to my head and that is not what you want with extensions so needless to say it's absolutely crucial to ask your salon what kind of hair they're using for your extension there's also different extension weights and so what I mean by that is how much hair is actually enough one extension so if I grab one of mine this one extension right here is one gram so it's one gram of hair there's also different lengths you can get tons of different lengths generally shorter lengths or cheaper longer lengths or more expensive I mean more hair you're obviously paying a little bit more mine are a 20 inch and they come just past my boobs and I like that length I probably wouldn't go any longer because it's already a lot of aftercare for this much hair you can also choose how much hair it goes in your head so say if you already have a lot of hair so you have pretty healthy hair you just want a little bit of length you might only choose to get a house head of extensions so meaning they would only put extensions just through the back and through the sides they wouldn't put any enough talk they wouldn't put any of talking near the back they just put a little bit underneath and that would give you the length that of course will be a lot cheaper than getting a full head like myself now that brings me to prices it's really hard to say what you should be paying for this type of extent because it's different all over the world with every different salon personally my best friend is my extensionists and hairstylist and colorist so she only charges me typically for just the product and not the actual labor generally when I've gone into a salon and I've inquired about keratin bonded extensions they're usually anywhere between 900 and $1500 of course again that does depend on how many you're putting in your length and the quality of the hair itself a lot of you have asked me is there a specific shampoo or conditioner or anything special that you have to do while washing your hair with this type of extension I personally haven't bought any type of shampoo or conditioner that's specifically meant for my extensions I've just use regular stuff but with that said I use regular stuff that is really high-quality I don't use drugstore shampoos and conditioners on my hair because I feel like I spent way too much on my extensions to skip out on aftercare it is so important to have good products if you're going to spend that much money on an extension because the good products will help that extension lasts for longer therefore your money stretches longer so I don't mind paying for a really good shampoo and conditioner if it does help my hair in the long run as for washing it there's not really any difference your hair feels a little bit heavier especially the first couple times you get in the shower just because you have a lot more hair for styling and stuff like that nothing's different you just have more hair again so make sure you do a lot a little bit more time towards your hair styling because it takes a little bit longer another question is how does it affect styling your hair personally since I have pretty short hair to begin with so just to the top of my boobs and it's really really thin if you guys probably seen it in previous videos when I had my extensions out in January anyways since my hair is pretty thin I have a lot of extensions in like I have probably about 250 pieces if not more in my head of extensions so for someone like me who has got many in it there are going to be a couple of different things I can't really do that well with my hair like half up styles so if I pull my hair half up you can see that you can see the bonds and that's not really something that you kind of aim to have done so typically I like to keep my hair you know in and down or op type thing when I do put my hair up and I actually like full-blown put it up if I spend the time too I can pull it up so that you can't really see the extension but there's no chance I can do like a full tight to my head style because you can see the bump where the extension is attached but if I'm doing just like a looser or messy style I can just put it up like that and you can't really notice and the thing is is that the extension is the same color as your hair so it kind of blends in anyways Carolee notice unless you're looking really close a lot of you have asked for thin hair can you see the bonds poking through and honestly if you have a bit of volume around the top and if your stylist just place them correctly you shouldn't be able to see them at all like if I turn my head like this you can't see any of the bonds although if I go like this and I pull it really really tight you can kind of see the bulk of the bonds poked through but day to day you can't really see it at all as long as the placement has been correct I do think the nice thing about styling your hair with keratin bonded extensions is out of any other extension option these are probably the most easiest to hide the fact that you have extensions another question is do you get them moved up or do you replace the entire lot you don't ever get them moved up they're completely glued into that exact spot so they last for however long you have them in then you get a new set although I will say after about two months I go back in and I get probably 15 pieces put back all around in spots where they have either fallen out or look a little bit sparse and yes they can fall out if your being you know rough with your hair and you can pull one out or say if you run a heat tool over top of it and you damage the bond it can fall out definitely if you have healthier hair like less bleached or less damaged hair it'll slip down the hair shaft a little bit so I can slip out of your hair and once it's out its out you just have to go to new and put back in typically I don't really find I have a huge problem with them falling out you know I might get maybe ten of them fall out in a span of three or four months but that is why I go back into the salon and I get them put back in whatever spots that I need them and I'm only charged a really really small fee like 20 bucks or whatever for putting that mani back in so it's not a big deal at all and I kind of like the refresher because it kind of refreshes your entire look your hair just looks like it's just been done when you do just a couple more pieces in your head another question is didn't matte up at all no they should not matter long as you're taking good care of them again I stressed the aftercare and I talked a lot about this in the second part of this video where I'm showing you how I style them and how I take care of them from shower to bedtime pretty much as long as you're doing those proper steps you won't have any issue another big question is can you swim in the ocean with them yeah it's absolutely no problem but I would say either wear your hair in a low ponytail a braid or let it flow free I know it sounds kind of weird but I found I have better luck if I just let my hair flow free in the ocean religiously before I go swimming I always put this product in it it is CPR bread the frizzy phase one smoothing cream essentially this helps protect from heat humidity solar saltwater and chlorine so this is great for blond hair if you have blond hair because chlorine can damage blond hair I speak about that in my blonde hair care video so don't miss out on that video I will link it down below I use this or a hair oil or a conditioner if I'm really stuck in my hair before I go in the ocean especially because I feel like it smooths my cuticles down and it really really protects my hair from the harshness of the salt water or the chlorine somebody is asking how long the processes of putting them in completely depends on how many you're getting put in your head like I said if you have a lot like me can take a couple hours I think the first time that Brooke did them on me it took about four hours she is so quick at it now she can probably put in my whole head in about two hours but if you're not getting that many in I mean you can get them put in like wham-bam super fast if you're only getting a touch-up like I said a little half pack or whatever Brooke can do that in like not even 20 minutes somebody is asking does this type of extension work with short layers yes it does and I speak from experience I had really really short layers of damaged bleached blonde hair and it worked on me you definitely can tell that you have extensions but if they cut your hair correctly at least it'll be very minimally noticed especially when your hair is curled definitely would recommend curling your hair because when you have your stick straight hair and you have a really short extension or if you have a really short layer you can totally see where the layer is and where the next layer is and where the next layer is but when it's curled at least curled into each other and it's a little bit Messier looking so it's easier to hide the main thing is after application your stylist has to cut your hair properly but extensions like these you can't just cut like a cross and do layers like that you have to slide cut so they take the hair and they cut will slide the scissors down your hair and that creates like wispy layers and it just blends your hair so much nicer Brooke does show that in my application video of when I got this applied the very first time so do check that out if you have kind of any questions of how it looks with a shorter layer the only bummer about having them with a shorter layer is that when it's windy or stuff like that your shorter layers can fly up in the wind and you can see the extensions underneath I used to have that happen all the time and especially since I have really really thin light hair that does happen to me but I mean there's only so much you can do right did they put stress on your scalp the first date or so that you have them yeah it definitely does you'll notice I usually have a headache the first day that I get the mane and it feels like it's been pulled but only because the hairstylist has to pull your hair a little bit while they're applying and so every individual piece over 200 times in my head has been pulled yeah your heads probably gonna hurt a little bit so I always take a Tylenol or whatever pretty much an hour after I get them put in but I feel fine the next day another question is are they comfortable when you sleep definitely not for your first you know two or three nights and especially if it's your first time ever getting a permanent extension in you're gonna feel them and they are tight to your head for the first you know a week or so so you feel them on your pillow it's not particularly comfortable but like I said take a Tylenol you'll get over it it'll be fine a good question that somebody's asked is how are the color matches with these extensions totally depends on where your salon is getting their product from but I do find and my hair stylist finds that most blonde colors generally come a lot warmer or more yellow toned than the average blonde I mean yeah you might keep your blonde really really yellowy and warm but I definitely don't and so when you put an extension in that's yellowy or arm lots of girls find like oh my gosh it doesn't match with my natural ashy hair so what you have to do is either get the salon to tell them beforehand or generally I find that I can just use purple conditioner like a really strong one and that'll tone it down enough and I'm pretty sure that that was what Shannon had with hers as well when she got hers in her natural hair is quite a bit ashy er than the extension all you need to do is purple shampoo or conditioner and they're like perfect match ask for highlights and lowlights it's no problem at all because they can order packs of slightly different colors so currently in my hair I have two different colors I have a platinum blonde which is kind of a highlight and then I do have a couple pieces that are a bit more of a low light throughout for brunettes I don't think it's an issue whatsoever it's really easy to match brunette colors as well as redhead colors and darker colors a lot of you also asked me can they be dyed I wouldn't recommend it even though you can the main reason I wouldn't recommend it is because it does damage that extension and you want that extension to be in the best shape for its entire lifetime until you get a new set so any type of bleaching or dyeing will you know damage it so I probably say keep with the same hair color as long as you have that set of extensions in if you want to change to a different hair color do it in between getting a new set in and just order the new set in whatever color you're planning on being somebody's asking are there any activities that you shouldn't be doing when you have hair extensions not particularly like I said if you're careful when you're swimming or in the ocean or in the pool that you're fine as long as you take you know precaution as well as you deal with aftercare of that you make sure that you are conditioning it using a good hair mask and brushing it out I would say if you're going to be summer really really windy like in a convertible or something I would put your hair back just because if it does get really really windy and messes up your hair it's easier for your hair to match so if I was riding on a motorcycle I'd put my hair in a braid and put my helmet overtop another commonly asked question is why would I recommend keratin bonded extensions over any other type of permanent extension when it adds to this I'm totally answering it from just my opinion in my experience I mean I'm sure there is lots of other exceptions and other people have other extension methods that they love and that's great if it works for you but I would definitely recommend a keratin bond to anyone who has thin fragile hair or colored hair or something like that because it is going to be a lot gentle or on your hair like a microbeads say if I try to put a micro bead in my thin blond hair it would tug it it would break it it would be heavy on it it would cause way too much stress and that's just not good for my hair whereas a keratin bond it's just stuck on my hair it's not particularly heavy blends in really well and it's not going to cause like damage and pulling on my hair as opposed to a metal bead or say with a like a woven weft when you put in like a sewn in hair extension and it's a weft of hair that's woven into like a really really tiny braid like they braid a tiny tiny braid along the back your hair and then they sew in an extension when you braid something and you're pulling that hair really really tight and close to your scalp that's gonna create breakage and for someone like myself that's a huge no-no because my hair breaks easily and not that would just cause even more breakage tape extensions I wouldn't recommend because I just think they look really really bad in most cases I mean no offense if you have them I mean you never know it could look nice in your hair but from the ones that I've seen they're generally not really really great extensions it's kind of about the cheaper option you can also really really see them when you put your hair up and stuff like that so I mean personally they're not my thing and I wouldn't recommend them to somebody else so yeah that's probably why I would recommend an keratin bond also you don't have to get them like touched up like they just stay in your hair that's it like there are months they're in they're in you don't have to go in for alternate appointments you have to pay more money they're just they're in okay when it comes to getting them out there is no like set expiry date pretty much issues personal preference you are going to know when you want them out and when they don't look good anymore and when they're patchy because a couple of them falling out you're gonna know for myself I don't get them removed until about 6 or 7 month mark because like I said I baby mine as well as I get a couple you know replacement ones put in throughout time of getting them so I really stretch it out when you do get them removed make sure you do go to a salon I know a lot of people think that they can do it themselves and hypothetically yes you could but you'll probably damage your hair a lot more if you do it yourself what a salon uses is pretty much an acetone based liquid so pretty much your strongest strongest nail polish remover almost similar to that they put that on the bond and they twist and twist and twist and pull and twist and then it'll slide off your hair yes sometimes that will take a little bit of hair with it but honestly I haven't had any problem with breakage through and through after two years having these extensions and getting them put in and take it out and put in and taking out and bleach blonde hair like I have really fragile hair and I honestly haven't had any issue with breakage with this type of extension and I would say that I'd probably be the best kind of model to put that on because my hair is bleach blonde and it is fragile and if a hair is going to break it's probably going to be this kind of hair but my hair has been in the best condition that it's ever been in since having these extensions and having blond hair and I would totally recommend them there's a lot of girls that do you have horror stories about these type of extensions but you have to look at everything what kind of extensions did they actually have what type of hair was it what did they do at the salon how did they apply them how did they care for them afterward it's like there's so many different factors so I think that that answered the majority of your guys's questions now I'm going to jump into how I care for my hair extensions from literally damp hair to when I go to bed so I hope you enjoyed the second part of the video and I hope that I answered all of your questions if not please do leave your question down below and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can [Music]",

        "video_sub_title": "[Music] when influenza came along National Public Health leaders said this is ordinary influenza by another name it was referred to as Spanish flu that was echoed in nearly every place in the country the Surgeon General said if proper precautions are taken you have no cause for alarm in other words they did nothing and they lied to the public your book describes a tragedy of unbelievable scale in the United States alone six hundred and seventy five thousand people died which is comparable to about a million point seven this is a 1918 what are we facing now how does this resonate with you this is your history of 1918 must play in your head all the time as you're watching television as you're thinking about what's going on a little bit too much right I'll let you know they're they're both respiratory viruses obviously fortunately this virus is I think considerably less lethal the 1918 unfortunately this virus is much more contagious the 1918 so even with the lower fatality rate which we're still not sure exactly what it is but it does clearly seem to be lower than 1918 you even with that lower fatality rate because more people are going to be infected we're still facing you know incredibly dramatic unfortunate numbers one of the most chilling moments in your book about 1918 comes when you compare Philadelphia to st. Louis what happened there Philadelphia was one of the first hit cities hit they again echoed the line that the national government was putting out there they had a huge Liberty loan parade scheduled virtually everyone in the public health community and the medical community wanted that canceled except public health commissioner he was part of the political machine and no backbone so the rain went forward and just like clockwork roughly 48 hours later the disease exploded in Philadelphia ended up with about 14,500 deaths if my memory serves - about two-thirds of them died in a 1415 week period beginning in late September 1918 st. Louis imposed all sorts of social distancing measures early and and had a much better outcome they didn't back flatten the curve a question there seems to be a minority opinion but it's one that I've heard come up in it and it certainly influenced at least for a while Boris Johnson's thinking in UK other heard of me or anything yes the idea is you let the influenza sweep through the community the death rate is higher but you haven't destroyed your economy because if you destroy your economy the downstream effects of that are even worse on the public health that a prolonged depression would lead to all kinds of horrible public health consequences even worse than the flu what do you think of that rationale well I think it's a legitimate question to ask the question is what price you going to have to pay to get there right now I think it looks like the number of deaths that might occur would be high enough that that would argue against that approach I actually to agree with Trump on one thing and that is once we get past this I think the economy will surge there are still going to be unfortunately tremendous number of dislocated workers you know hopefully Congress as we are taping this Congress is trying to figure out what they were going to do hopefully that will be addressed something like I heard you know Schumer say the government should guarantee four to six months of full compensation for those who are unemployed and if we do that that will significantly minimize the economic impact and again there will be demand for every thing once we get through the cycle and we will get through this cycle obviously the only way that this virus disappears and it's just real eradication is not that's not going to happen this virus is here forever right it is either through herd immunity where the vast majority of people are immune in some way having had it or vaccine comes along and protects a huge number of people right below that with the vaccine that's at least a year out herd immunity nobody really wants to absorb the losses that come with that so how do you see the waves of this occurring over the you know I guess to be a historian is by definition to have the luxury not to predict the future but rather to examine the past but indulge us for for this one time how do you expect to see this in terms of the science in terms of the virus itself playing out in the next year or two or three if we can quote flatten the curve phrase you've never heard right and if the healthcare system can function well then we will accomplished a lot you know I would expect to see this come and go we may get lucky most viruses do in fact in high humidity and high heat do less well outside the body so we may get arrested and as summer comes but I would expect to see essentially several waves of this waves of this scale I would I would expect to see up and down up and down at least several cycles of that and I would think the next cycle would probably be less and then less you you wrote recently in the New York Times whether we use that time well meaning the time that we have to get out in front of this although weird however belatedly we're whether we use that time well will determine whether a month from now the United States looks like Italy where the virus seems out of control where South Korea which seems to have gained control by testing whether 270,000 of its 51 million people just the United States now resemble Italy more than it does South Korea well on the plus side I think we've instituted the social distancing much earlier than Italy they started out with quarantine but it was in extremely leaky quarantine so it really had no effect in terms of testing obviously were way way way way behind you can't isolate someone if you don't know they're sick you can't trace your contacts if you don't know they're sick I have a lot of concern I'm over 70 so I'm target audience my wife's over 70 she's the target audience if you're infected with the virus it could take anywhere from 2 to 14 days before you get sick it's important than that point be made to everyone so that they won't lose heart when they think that we're doing all these things and yet the case counts are still going up there's a real time lag between the institution of any restrictions and any benefit that we see real keys to success is compliance if people don't heed the advice then we're in trouble what do you recommend as people are trying to live their lives and be as safe as possible what are the key things that you recommend in New York with your great historical knowledge and your knowledge of what's going on now I would say what's going in what we are doing what most of us are doing anyway the social distancing that doesn't mean you can't communicate with people you can communicate over the Internet I was just walking through the French Quarter people you know stopping on the street from different sides of the street talking across you know and there's actually a good feeling when you have that human connection I think it's very important you [Music]",

        "video_sub_title": "[Music] hi welcome to another episode of talking with docs I'm dr. Bradley and I'm dr. Paul's alo'so on today's episode we're just gonna answer a viewer question my leg is swollen after my hip or knee replacement is this normal good question barrel woman not sorry sorry to tell you totally normal it's very very common to have swelling after surgery of the lower extremity so people see anybody like had surgery a hip why is my foot Swan makes no sense makes no sense so far away it happens though whenever we do surgery or you have surgery there's bleeding okay it's inevitable there's gonna be some bleeding there's gonna be some inflammation and bleeding and inflammation results in fluid yep in that extremity and because we live on earth gravity pulls the fluid down and no swelling down your leg absolutely the other thing that I tell people is that if you notice when you wake up so long it's not too bad and then if the day goes on gravity does exactly what Paul's talking about pulls it down to your feet and then the third thing is cuz you're not walking as much as you normally are that fluid is not being kind of pumped back to your heart so the muscles of your calves every time you push your toes down onto the ground it squeezes against the veins that have one-way valves and pushes that fluid back so there's a tendency to pool one hand at any age those one-way valves we come a little bit incompetent yes and they can't deal with the excess fluid as well so it's harder to get that fluid back out of there what do you tell people to do stand on your head for six hours a day get one of those those foot boards those yeah traversing clients no no why I tell people would get up move around as much as you can yep and I'm a big fan of compression stockings okay yeah you know who's not a big fan of people's after American and you might wear it stuff they're very hard to put on yes and they're uncomfortable but they work amazing or Ted's doggies or like when you're even on the plane a lot of people wear them so if you can get those bad boys on I think it's a great idea get some help I think elevation is important for me so not that you're having being elevated all day but if it does get swollen is starting to throb then put it up for a little bit means maybe you're doing a little bit too much yeah another thing I tell people is ice yeah I think if you if you can ice it it's gonna reduce some of the local swelling and if you have a total knee replacement and you ice your foot it might not make a big difference for you should ice the knee and then they'll end up being less fluid in your foot here's a tricky thing I check for to let's say operate on someone's right hip or right knee and we're looking for swelling and you're seeing swelling in the right leg that makes sense yeah now let's say I'm looking I'm examining my patient after they've had swelling in the right hip area and they have swelling in both ankles sympathetics one my sister had surgery now my legs are swollen no it's it's an it's a very important distinction after you've got swelling in both sides that could be a more systemic sort of issue maybe you've got too much fluid on board maybe your heart can't keep up and you can't pump the blood I mean swelling in both ankles in the absence of any surgery is can be an early sign of congestive heart failure yeah or maybe have bad beans on both sides to start bad veins on the outsides so if you have swelling if you're swelling is getting worse on both sides you kind of want to check that out and make sure everything is going okay with the old pump make sure your heart is pumping everything appropriately and I'd say one other thing that I think is really important if you have a really swollen leg after surgery that's common but if you have a really swollen leg and a very painful calf this is a sign that you may have a blood clot so a deep vein thrombosis oh when blood pools there sometimes you can get a clot and that clot can cause swelling and pain so swelling without pain down in the lower leg is common just swelling in the lower leg that's very painful is is thankfully quite uncommon but not impossible in the setting of a hip or knee replacement and that needs to be investigated carefully okay so there you got it swelling in the limb after lower extremity sir is common even after trauma and the lower cabinets common things to watch out for though you want to make sure it's not a blood clot which we'd have swelling in a calf and it would it would really hurt well or swelling in both sides that's sort of a lot worse than what you typically get and of course if there's a lot of redness pain fever could be a sign of an infection but the majority of the time swelling in the lower extremity after surgery is common and just part of the healing process last question how long everybody's different depending on those veins and depending on the valves you know I honestly tell people it can be swarm for six months or so do I three six months yes you know what I mean yeah it can it can persist quite a while yeah so don't so don't panic if you if a month later you're like oh man my legs not getting it's like improving but it's still so on that would be very very common just put on some compression stockings yeah walk it off there you go so if you liked this video please like it subscribe to our Channel and remember you are in charge of your own health see you next

        "video_title": "5 Tight Muscle Treatments - Ask Doctor Jo",
        "video_sub_title": "hey everybody it's Doctor Jo, and today I'm going to show you my top five treatments for tight muscles. so let's get started. so the first thing you want to do when you have tight muscles is do a good warm-up first. if you go into stretches right away, you usually don't get as much benefit if you warm up. then the muscles are nice and loose and warm and they stretch a little bit better. so I usually like to use a band just to do a warm-up. so if I was having my tight muscles maybe my quads my hamstrings maybe even my glutes, I would just take a band and then just kind of put it around my thighs here and then just lie down. and the reason I like the band is because it kind of gives you some resistance in a bunch of different direction, so I'm going to do a bridge but I'm gonna do a bridge with the band. so I have some resistance going this way as well as when I come up .so I want to still keep my knees about hip, shoulder width apart, and then I'm going to try and keep that amount of tension on it as I come up into the bridge. so if I if my knees start coming in, and they can't hold that tension, it might just be a little bit too much of a resistance band. but just holding right there come up into that bridge, get that nice kind of straight line at the top if you can. if you can't that's okay and then just nice and slow controlling it back down. so with this I would just start off with maybe you know 10. you can do one to two sets of ten and this is a great way to kind of get those muscles loosened up. it's kind of a whole leg kind of thing. you can also stand up and do some squats with the band as well. so kind of using that band to get that extra kind of warm-up with it, but you're not doing a big heavy exercise yet. you're just getting those muscles warm. so after you get up nice and warmed up, then you can do a little bit of rolling out. if your muscles are really tight sometimes stretches don't quite do the job, so you can use something like a rolling stick to kind of get it worked out. so let's say my quad's really tight here. I like using a stick because you have a little bit more control. you can come over on the side. I get that IT band a little bit come up onto the quads. you can get the lateral you can get the main one, you can get the VMO on the inside and then even the adductor. so if I'm really tight in that area this is a great way to kind of loosen it up. even if I wanted to go back into the hamstrings on this side I could do that as well. so when you're using a rolling stick, or something this one's nice because it is firm it doesn't give. and so it gives you a lot of some pressure on there you can easily just start off with maybe like one minute if you have really tight muscles this this will work it out and you're going to feel it but eventually you can go up to you know two three maybe even five minutes of just rolling out the whole body. you can kind of even go into the calf as well and get it nice and loosened up. so if if you don't have a rolling stick, or if you know you want something maybe a little bit more pressure than the rolling stick, you can use a roller. this one is really cool because you can see it's got some acupressure points on it. so again maybe if I wanted to roll out my calves but maybe the stick wasn't quite enough, then I can start using a little bit of bodyweight pressure. so I'm just kind of I can turn it in and out get all sides of that calf. these little acupressure points are giving that extra push in there, and so I'm feeling a nice good stretch in there. and if that's not if that's actually too much with the acupressure points, you can take this piece off right here, and then just use the roller. now this isn't a foam roller you can see here it's it's made out of a firm rubber material, so it's nice and solid. so again this is going to give you that nice pressure for those tight muscles to work them out. and so as you can see here, I've used a couple different things so far and the folks at Skyin sent me their recovery kit. and so this is really cool because if you have if you work out a lot, and you have tight muscles sometimes it's nice to have a variety of things to use because you know this might be great for a smaller muscle, this might be great for a larger muscle group. you know if you're doing your arms or your shoulders you can do it with just here, but that might not but enough pressure. so you can get the roller now since this is not a foam roller, since it's that hard rubber, you don't want to do something like rolling out your spine because that's going to just be a little bit too much pressure. so just make sure that you're aware of that and so then also you can just use for the acupressure points here. so if you were sitting you could put your feet on it. a lot of times when you have just general tight muscles even down into your feet like a plantar fascia maybe, the plantar fasciitis or just maybe some cramping and the arches. if you're sitting in a chair, you might get more pressure you can also just if you've got some tightness in your low low back. a lot of times those acupressure points have been shown to really kind of help relax the muscles. so you can just kind of lie down on it for some people this might be uncomfortable at first because you know they're they're little points. so you feel the kind of tingling feeling but if you lie here for long enough maybe a minute to two minutes it gets a kind of nice warm feeling because it just helps increase the circulation. and a lot of times with tight muscles, what's happening is you're not getting good circulation in there. so that's just a really really good way to kind of try different things and get that that blood flowing that circulation increase to get those tight muscles out of there. and the strap is really cool I wanted to go back to that really quickly because you can see here that you can change the loop size, and that also gives you a little bit of different tension. so it has a couple different spots here where you can change it which is really nice as well. and then it also has a little two little silicone strips on the inside so then it doesn't slip as much. so this is a really cool type of band as well and it's also cloth instead of latex so it's gonna last you a lot longer than other types of resistive bands. so if you're interested in purchasing the recovery kit make sure and click on the link up there .so the last one that I really like is kind of doing just a whole body stretch. especially if you're tight sometimes you might just be maybe tight in your calves because you're running a lot, but a lot of times if you're doing a whole body workout you're you're tight kind of all over. and probably my favorite whole body stretch is a prayer stretch. and so with a prayer, if you're comfortable getting down on your knees that's great on the floor any of these you it's better to do on a firm surface, but you can do them on your couch or on the bed. but if your knees aren't too painful just to come down like this. you're gonna go into a prayer stretch where then you're just stretching your arms out and then coming all the way down. so you can see here I'm stretching out my shoulders. if I have some tight shoulders I'm stretching out my hips, my knees, and even my feet. you can see they're pointed out so it's really a nice whole body stretch. and so this one you'd really want to lie here for about thirty seconds and then come back up and do three times. so you can you can start here and roll out or if that doesn't quite work for you maybe if your knees are a little tight, you can actually start with your hands out in front of you, and then lean back. so if I couldn't go all the way down I'm still getting a really nice shoulder stretch. I'm still stretching out my hips and my knees and my feet as well. so I really like to finish off with that whole body stretch which is really nice. so those were my top five treatments for muscle tightness. if you're interested in purchasing the recovery kit, make sure and click on the link up there. and don't forget to subscribe by clicking down there. and remember be safe, have fun ,and I hope you feel better soon.",

        "video_sub_title": "I have to start again poll look at me look at me you better still be rolling buddy or there's gonna be trouble okay this next secret let me ask the group as a whole how many if you really don't like taking your head and neck into extension and be honest only one you're lying okay there's three four and there's many more than that I want to show you through this this jaw and face exercise sequence just why it is that people don't like to take their heads and neck back they see they feel it feels insecure firstly and secondly it hurts that's why people don't like to do it so the first test is how wide can you open your mouth so we want according to travellin sums I'm quoting the great two villains Lyman's now we need to be able to fit three knuckles in between upper and lower jaw so what minimum flexibility now we were doing this on one workshop once and this and this girl I can't remember whether she was tall or short like I mean she put a whole fist in mouth is fist just disappeared into her mouth and everyone just looked shocked but she had very very flexible jaw muscles that's the point so what we want to do is did you feel when you open your mouth wide could you feel what was actually restricting you there so watch this sequence please and we're going to do this now we are going to stretch the muscles which these muscles here the jaw muscles very powerful muscles with extremely good leverage I think human jaws can generate four or five hundred pounds per square inch or it might be up even higher anyway lots of force and people who grind their teeth at night time it's a Brooke Brooke cirrhosis Brookes bruxism Thank You Brooke closes at some cattle disease I think for them anyway if you do grind your teeth these exercises are immensely helpful okay so sit up straight everyone please now watch me do it first before doing it so this is a Simon Says thing wait for me to tell you please say open your mouth wide ah ha ha ha ha ha let me add some worse to that we open the mouth as wide as possible you put 2 fingers of each hand on the lower jaw you apply a gentle biting force to your fingers and don't let your fingers move then take a breath in and on a breath out very carefully draw the jaw down now listen be aware this joined here the temporomandibular joint is an extremely small joint if you look at a skeleton it will shock you am i right it's about the size of your little finger now it's very small what's more it's a gliding sliding joint and so the resultant force and what you experience is pain or tension at this joint here is nothing more than the sum of the forces of all the muscles we're going to stretch in the next few minutes you want them soft and relaxed okay so open the mouth wide everyone please place the fingers on the bottom jaw and take the down a little bit further your fingers will allow the jaw to come down a bit throw that can everyone feel that and then once you're in that second position apply a biting force to the fingers but do not let the fingers move 3 2 1 stop now having done that take a breath in and gently draw the jaw down and keep it down do it slowly please and feel the immense sensation in this area here keep going down bindu further down breathe and relax ok then stop that bring the jaw back to its normal position open the mouth wide again and normal position and relax wait we'll get there Jack we'll get there now the next action that I'd like you to practice is protraction pushing the jaw forwards at all I'm just going to turn side on so you might want to reframe on this it's like this with the teeth separated everything nice and straight and then watch pushing the jaw forward and again do this slowly please you'll feel this is a completely different set of muscles that move the jaw forward so and relax and now retraction the opposite direction so it turns out on again pull so as you can Raymond this it's bringing the jaw straight back so and fill that up in here and feel that inside the mouth and then last of all sideways movements but not casually done slowly and put a little bit of effort into it so I'm talking about this and back to neutral and like so many of our exercises can you feel there's a difference between left and right going left and going right you're starting to identify these fundamental jaw tension patterns can'tcan't hard to go and the other and the other way when when when when you watch a roomful of people practicing these exercises it does look as though we've been hitting the alcohol or just it's just a bit hard so just quickly to go through them again it's added two little contractions in and then protraction rejection card right bye-bye and now jack any easier okay now this is just a setup I setup for experiencing the sensation of taking the head and neck but before we do that let's do a neck rotation exercise because as I've mentioned elsewhere many times if you have anybody in your class who claims they have a neck problem and who may indeed have a neck problem the most the safest and most indirect way into helping someone with neck tension if it's assuming that the neck problem is a result of neck tension is simply to encourage them to turn the head further and we do it like this remember just let your hands rest lightly on your knees sit up nice and straight now straight here is not an aesthetic thing it's trying to make the spine as long as possible as in all of our rotations we're trying to distribute the load over as many vertebra as we can rather than just a few do you remember that from the seated rotation so like this if I turn their head to the left and go as far as possible until you come to that barrier stop let your shoulders drop down take a breath in and on a breath out turn the head further again let the shoulders drop take another breath in and turn the head further in the same direction try not to move your shoulders and come back to the center position and if we've observed before even though you've done that and seen that effect that still won't allow you to go past that barrier when you go to the other side so as far as possible turn stop take a breath in turn further stop breathe out take a breath in and further still and come back to the front and then this is the bit that I love the most go straight back the last position and straight back to the last position without impediment that's what we want that's all you need to do to improve your neck rotation capacity now the last part of this sequence for the last two parts we open the mouth wide I'll demonstrate this first and then overthrew we open the mouth wide and then and then close the teeth and immediately so treat that as one sequence that's backwards forwards and then back to the start position so open the mouth wide slowly tilt the head back rows your teeth is still closed just checking open the mouth wide and slowly tilt the head back now if you have freely it moves by comparison to normal and now once it's all the way back don't let it move and slowly close your teeth now feel all that tension in the front of your neck that's why you don't like to bend your neck back normally because you're requiring of these muscles at the back here to stretch the front neck muscles as well as move the head and for many people's necks that's too much work to ask and the muscles at the back of the skull and Neath the back of the skull just tighten up or go into spasm so now open your mouth bring the head forward you can use your fingers to help you do that if you need to immediately close the teeth and bring the chin as far forward as you can and by all means put a little bit of extra weight on the back of the head like this to stretch the back of the neck and then run your fingers over you're fired and lift the head bending the head back was that different that time that is the secret loosen these muscles here you know culture people are extremely tight in the jaw muscles and extremely tight yeah however everyone can do this and on a strength note just aside and aside to this we've tested this many times if you lie with your head with the head in and the back of the neck over the edge of a mattress for a bit of support you'll find most of you will not be able to lift your head up ten times from the face up position but if you do the same thing with your head facing down you'll have no trouble doing ten or twenty the muscles at the back of the neck are way stronger than the muscles at the front the muscles at the front are very tight we want to get that into a better balance and for many people strengthening the anterior neck muscles and stretching the posterior neck muscles that's all I need to do and the way into that the easiest way into that is to encourage rotation first because if you watch the muscles in my neck and if you hold this artificial alignment one set of muscles is really doing the work of turning the head the rest are involved in holding the alignment but all by getting a stretch a stretch or a strengthen are there any questions on that sequence",

        "video_title": "DIY Archery Target - Third Hand Skins",
        "video_sub_title": "so I just finished building one of these targets four foot by four foot by 12 inches deep made following the instructions and the target skins from third hand archery which by the way Jim from third hand sent me and big shout out and thanks to him for sending those over I've been using one of his bow holders on my tree stand for years and years and years so I figured this would probably be a good product but of course had to check it out first and I probably put about three to four hundred shots into it so far I'd guess as far as the actual build itself it came with a sheet of instructions and it's based off the fact that you're using 12 inch wide lumber and then the front face is just quarter inch by like one and a half inch wide trim that goes around underneath the target skins and themselves which there's one on the front and one on the back it calls out to use black plastic or black fabric of some kind and essentially the only purpose it serves is to make sure that you can't see all your stuffing material through the white face of the fabric so I just use some black landscaping fabric and I attach that down underneath the skins this target is made to be a feel point target not a broad head target and one of the main ikono officials a concerns one of the main questions I had about this target was you know you can buy these skins from third-hand for around $40 what makes them special what makes them different from just using like a tarp and otherwise doing the build on your own could you use you know like a feed bag or some other kind of material other than the skins that they sell and so I asked Jim this question and he said going back years and years and years like 35 years ago he found out by accident that clothes old clothes stop the arrows well I don't know the full story behind that but it's probably pretty interesting but he had a company that he worked with that had this fabric and that fabric worked well for containing all the clothes and he had a bag target that he sold and they tested over a hundred different kinds of fabric to test for durability of the fabric itself how well it did outside how well they could print onto it and eventually wound up just using the fabric that we still have today and that is currently in my target and in fact on some of the targets the third hand sells some of the skins I should say they're not full targets they do have warranties the 4x4 doesn't have a warranty because there's no spots printed on it but the other target skins like the three by three that do have printing on it they do have warranties if you punch through a certain size hole over time soon X number of arrows as I was building this thing I read through a bunch of threads and Archer talked to try and figure out what the modifications from the original design people had made what they decided to stuff their target with to stop the arrows of course Jim said use old clothes the best thing they found over the decades that these things have been sold I had gathered all the clothing that I could find in my house and it basically got up to about right there and it was like three laundry baskets full of stuff that I was just gonna date to good well so I had all the rest of this stuff to fill up with and I had seen people using you know old plastic bags which I've also heard could stick to the arrows a whole bunch of different things but what I eventually decided to do was we have a goodwill here in the Twin Cities that has basically bulk shopping you can go in there fill up a shopping cart roll up the shopping cart onto a scale and they'll charge you ninety nine cents a pound and so after I had filled the Target up to here it took one trip of 48 pounds to get the target to about right here and then one more trip of 25 pounds to really stuff it in the top and I was really jamming those clothes tightly in there and I wanted to try and stick with items that were synthetic rather than cotton so I went to grabbed all like the fleece throws comforters that were synthetic all that kind of stuff just because they packed together really well it was less total garments than trying to go through like a bunch of sweatshirts and t-shirts and stuff so I really try to stay with those fleece blankets and it seems to have been holding up very well so far the other kind of question are concerned that I had is how was it going to hold up with micro diameter shafts because I've got standard diameters I've got lots of micro diameters for hunting and just kind of general shooting for the last few years I've really moved toward core diameters I've got some Pierce Platinum's that I shoot out of my compound and then I've gone through a bunch of different things with my recurve but what I'm using right now is some victory VIPs and the thing with shooting those kind of arrows into this target is of course if there's anything that can catch on the backside of that insert it'll make the arrow harder to remove and then it of course also can degrade the life of the target I guess so your best bet for target longevity is gonna be standard diameter shafts but basically all the shooting that I've been doing in this thing so far has been with these micro diameters and yeah it sticks a little bit sometimes you pull the thing out but so far there's no big gashes no big holes that still stopping the arrow it's just fine I shot my compound basically at point-blank range 25 arrows as soon as I had this thing put together all pretty much in the same spot didn't adjust the target at all and none of those arrows were protruding through the backside of the target which was a good sign obviously the backside of the target was bulging out a bit and if you kind of shoot across the entire face and spread the arrows out it does kind of seem to really negate that it's only shooting the same spot over and over and over again that you get that little segregated bulge but then when you could what you can do once you shoot this thing a lot is you can take the whole target rotated 180 degrees and then start shooting it back the other way and that kind of takes all that stuff again slowly moves it back the other direction so following that kind of a pattern you could of course use this thing for a really long time some of the other mods that I'm not going to be doing for this target but I've seen other people use one I've seen people add wheels so they can move the target around it's extremely heavy obviously because you got not only close to 100 pounds of stuffing in here but also you got the weight of the lumber the two by twelves and everything else so it makes sense to have something that's mobile what would make more sense to me if I had space to do it if I had the space outside to have a 6,800 yard range I would almost rather just put that target in one spot build a nice awning to go over the top to keep the rain running off it and then just drill in arrow holders at twenty thirty forty all the way back so that I'm moving myself as opposed to having to move the target which is gonna be a lot easier the other thing that I found through reading the various forums is that for sticking targets onto the face of the target itself these plastic cap nails for roofing work really well the actual nail itself is kind of a this kind of got like a ribbed surface and then of course you got this nice probably a three quarter inch diameter plastic face so when you stick this thing into a piece of paper you can hear it really grip into the face of the fabric and it holds those things in there really nice and well so to this point so far out of the few hundred arrows I putting this thing I've been pretty happy shooting both the recurve and the compound the compound obviously the arrows are going a lot further and then it will to recurve and that kind of depends also on what your gonna stop it with and how tightly you pack it if you got a bunch of kids that are gonna be shooting these type of targets then you don't want to stuff it as full because sometimes those arrows will just bounce out versus if you're shooting like a crossbow you're really gonna want to pack that stuff in or maybe even bump up to a wider target overall and put more clothing in it to try and get that total stopping force so I'll probably end up doing a follow-up video on this maybe you know several months down the road just to see how this target face has continued to hold up after continued shooting with these micro diameter shafts but so far at this point have been pretty happy with it so if you guys have built one of these yourselves you're thinking about it have any more questions leave them down in the comments down below I'd love to hear what other mods some of you guys have come up for this thing thanks for watching",

        "video_sub_title": "\u266a Bob and Brad \u266a \u266a the two most famous physical therapists on the internet \u266a - Hi folks am Bob Schrupp physical therapist. - Brad Heineck physical therapist. - We are the most famous physical therapists on the internet. - In our opinion of course Bob - Surgery for your knee arthritis, not so fast. We're gonna show you eight best exercises of physical therapists and hopefully, this'll maybe buy you some time. - Right. - Maybe it'll buy you years. - It's really very possible. - Sure. - By the way, if you're new to our channel, please take a second to subscribe to us. We provide videos on how stay healthy fit and pain-free. and we also, (chuckles) every day. Also if you get a chance, go to www.bobandbrad.com, go to the giveaway section, because we're always giving something away. We have a giveaway contest where we're giving away a Booyah Stik. You can always find the contest, it'll be pinned at the top of the page on Facebook, and if you go to Twitter or Instagram or Tick Tock, you get a 60 second version of our program. - There you go. - Brad, this video is actually for a former patient of mine. He's been having some trouble in his knee. I know we showed you some exercises, but we're gonna show you a few more maybe here or at least condensed, you know have them summarized. - Sure. - So that he knows what they are all are, I know also I've talked to you about using a walking stick or a cane, and I don't know if you're still doing that, but if your knee is still bothering you, I'd still like you to go back to that for a while. - Reduce the weight-bearing. - Yeah I'm gonna mention a couple of ones that were sent to us by a company here. We have no relationship with them, but as I just mentioned, I liked their Prime stick. This is actually a walking stick that they use. It adjusts, yeah you can make it any length you want and it just easy. You just twist it like this and it's lightweight, it's got a good handle. And yeah, you're uneven there Brad. - Yeah that's alright I've always been that way. - They also came out with a cane. So that's called the Prime stick. This is called a Cyclone Cane. I didn't like the adjustment on it. I gotta be honest Brad. I thought the adjustment was a little onerous, a little hard to do, - Yeah - But once you got it in place, it doesn't matter. - Right, you only adjust once. - A very comfortable cane as far as handle. - I really like the handle. - Best handle I've seen. They recommend you actually have the handle out like this instead of like this. - Right. - Interesting. - Which, i like it. - Ergonomically works better, but not set for me right now, - No its a little short, let me try. - Yeah, that's good for me. - Yeah. - Yeah it really has got a nice grip. - Alright let's go into the exercises. The first one and I think you're doing this one already. I don't wanna use your name because I don't know, People - No you better be stealth. - The first one you're actually going to do, I know we talked about that. I don't want you to sit with the knee bent more than 90 degrees. So if you are like this, I don't want you to sit because he works at a desk a lot. - Oh sure. - I don't want you to sit (mumbling) he said yeah my doctor told me that too. - Yeah - Because this actually is putting pressure on the knee all day long. So you wanna have the knee out like this sometimes Or maybe just like this, but every so often, you're gonna do active knee extension - Yeah. - Five times I'd like to see you probably do both knees, just five times every 30 minutes. And this is just getting some movement in there, getting some fluid in there. It's just a great one to do. It doesn't take very long, You know, you can actually keep working while you're doing it. - Yeah it's good for circulation, strength in the legs. - Now, if you're on the opposite end of the spectrum, and you're doing a lot of standing for some reason, Brad, if you're standing up for a long time, Your job requires it, then I want you to try to sit down every so 30 minutes - Right. - And you're gonna flex the knee. One, two, three. - The idea is to keep things moving - Four,right. - Don't be in a static position for long periods of time. - All right So, that's the first two. The next one. If you're lacking some knee extension, your knee doesn't completely straight out. Especially if you compare like one knee, that's worse than the other. All right If I put this knee up and they can see, you have a little bit of a bend, this one goes completely straight. You're gonna wanna work on that extension. It can be very Subtle by the way. - Sure - It could be very minimal (mumbling) train die. It would take a train die sometimes to pull it out. - Right, perhaps exaggerating so you can see it. - So what you're gonna do is you're gonna work with that knee. You're gonna do pressure on, you're not gonna push right on the knee itself, but I push right above it. Pressure on pressure off. pressure on pressure off six. You know you can do that for 10 times, but you can do it on a bed too, six to eight times a day. This is a really important one because we have found, if you regained the extension, quite often what happens is that the pain level goes down. It just a seems to coincide. - So I was just showing you could put a towel roll underneath your ankle, that gives you a space if you're doing it, you know in bed. You could put a towel, not a towel roll but you know ( both mumbling) Yeah just to make it more comfortable - Now let's say you're doing this. Ah, it's just not helping. What I want you to try, is either turning the foot out or turning the foot in and then do pressure on pressure off. See which one feels better. For my wife It was turning it out a little bit, and she did pressure on pressure off like this. She really, it took time, but she really had good results from the knee. She's back running again like we just mentioned a different video. kind of really almost a semi miracle, because I mean she was to the point where she was using double crutches. (both chuckling) I mean she was - Did you get credit for that Bob? - Yeah, she does She does give me credit, - Good - But it's funny, I just remember her crying in the bathroom like \"I don't want a knee replacement\" and I'm like no, you're not having a knee replacement yet. - I hope she doesn't see this video. - I know I hope she doesn't either she's not gonna be happy with me. - So anyway, try one way the same thing It's gonna be 10 times, six to eight times a day. I know you're going to say, are you kidding me? I can't be doing an exercise that often. Well then you're gonna live with the pain. You know am sorry. - And they don't take that long 10 times its gonna take you 30 seconds. - Yeah its gonna make a big difference. Now, let's say you're one of those people that's lacking bending. So I check one side, check the other side and it doesn't bend as far. All right In that case, what are you gonna do is the same thing, but pressure on pressure off with the bending and again 10 times. - And the nice thing about this one you can do it laying down, you can do it in bed. You know, you can go on the floor if you'd like to. You wanna show them? - Yeah show the towel, if you're not making gains on that, what you might do is take a rolled up towel, stick it on there into the what do we call it? Knee gap? - Its a popliteal fossa. - Popliteal fossa i was trying to think of that. And then I was trying to think of the lay person term. I couldn't come up with either. So this actually kind of gaps the knee. It actually feels good. It's a great one to do. You know, when you are checking comparing one knee to another, you may not even hardly see it. Like there's a lack of a vignette but you'll feel it. - Sure - Yeah that one just doesn't go as well. - You Can I actually put your hand in there like this and do it doesn't work quite as well, but you get some benefits from that, just an option. - I'm gonna Show you one more variation on that too. So I'll show it in this direction here actually toward you. What you could, this is an advanced one. So what I'm gonna do actually, while I'm bending the knee, I'm actually gonna turn to the, the lower tibia fibula out this way. I'm gonna turn it and while I'm turning it, I'm gonna bend the knee. I'm holding it in the turn the whole entire time. The only reason I bring this up, is because some people have really had good luck with this. So I'm twisting it the entire time out this direction. If it was this leg, I would twist it this direction. All right. - Yeah that one is a little advanced. I've had patients that've had, it's somewhat tough to teach some people. - Yes - Because you're not, you know you're grabbing the tibia through the flesh. - The only reason I'm doing it Brad is cause some people have really had good luck with it. I just hate not mention it. - So You'll know if you do it because it's gonna feel good and It's gonna be very obvious that you can get more range. - All right then we're gonna start you with some strengthening. So like in the McKenzie book, which a lot of this is from by the way, how to treat your own knee, Robin McKenzie. What they actually do is they have you take your chair up to a door. Let's say the doors this way Brad and you can actually grab the handle and start doing sit to stands like this. Now you certainly can do this by a sink too, just grab onto the sink or our counter. - So if you're strong enough to do it without that you stooge. - You can well, what they want you to do is quite often is pull yourself up and then lower yourself down sure you're doing a little bit of eccentric strengthening. But very soon, if that works pretty well, you can then progress to just doing squats without it. So you can just do them like this, or you can even do pushups, push out if you have arms on the chair. You can do them prisoner squats. - Ooh that's a little more aggressive. That's quite a bit harder. - Right and eventually you can even go to the point where you start going down and don't touch the chair. - It's nice to have the chair behind you, just in case you need gives out or you lose your balance, You don't fall. - Right and the whole thing here is We're trying not to flare up the knee. Don't do things that are gonna make it worse. - Right - So Brad, we're already at number eight. We made it. - Eight - I know you like seven. - I know I like seven but - You know what i did? I added one just to bug you. - Oh really? - Yeah. - Okay Show me. - Well, that was it. Number eight. - Oh (laughing) - I could've done seven plus one a bonus. - We are really in tune today. - All right, enjoy the eight. Thanks for watching. - We did it already. - Yeah we did it.",

        "video_sub_title": "Sinusitis is a common condition that causes the lining of your sinuses and nasal passages to become inflamed. It is typically caused by bacterial or viral infection. Some symptoms include face pressure or pain, headaches, a blocked nose and fever. There are two types of sinusitis: acute and chronic sinusitis. To treat acute sinusitis, there are some home remedies you can try. Using a saline nasal spray which can be bought at your local pharmacy will help clear your nose. Sleeping with a few pillows that elevate your head well out mucus to drain and help you breathe easier at night. To relieve your sinus headache you can place a cold pack on your forehead. Holding a warm moist flannel over your sinus to help relieve the pain and pressure in your face. Some people find that neti pots help to clear your nasal passages. It is important to use sterile water, not tap water. This can be purchased in a pharmacy or you can boil some water and I'll allow it to cool. Drinking plenty of water and staying hydrated will help thin your mucus and treat your sinusitis. Essential oils such as peppermint oil can help to create a sensation that your nasal passages are opening. Make sure to take a break and get some rest to help your body recover. Using a humidifier can help keep moisture in the air making it more comfortable to breathe. Unfortunately there is no single cure but there are lots of different treatment options available to manage your chronic sinusitis. You can use a saline nasal wash, either a spray or a douche or a neti pot to help clear irritants and allergens. Other treatments you can speak to your doctor about include nasal corticosteroids, oral corticosteroids, long-term antibiotics and surgery if all other treatments fail. Please note you should visit your GP if your symptoms are severe and painkillers are not helping or your symptoms are becoming even worse.

To learn more about sinusitis Dr Abby Hyams has written an in-depth guide for Medicspot. You can find a link to the full guide in the description below.",

        "video_sub_title": "hello and welcome to math simplified i am dr umar malik and i hope all of you are doing well in this video we'll be talking about tina cruz better known as jokset tina cruz or jock itch is a fungal infection that causes a red scaly and itchy rash in warm moist areas of the body the rash often affects the groin the inner thighs and is usually shaped like a ring jock itch gets his name because it's common in athletes it's also common in people who sweat a lot or who are overweight although often uncomfortable and bothersome jock itch is a very common condition and usually isn't serious but keeping that in mind never ignore any disease and always seek medical help at the earliest hence it is very important to treat it at an early stage because if not rated in the early stages it becomes very difficult to treat later on as the topical drugs that are used for the treatment of normal fungal infections of the skin fail to act effectively at later stages of the disease fungi thrive in warm moist environments so this type of environment can cause them to naturally overpopulate the same fungi that cause nail infections athlete's foot and drink worm can cause jock itch these belong to a group of fungi known as the termatophytes trichophyton is the most common dermatophyte involved in jocket other dermatophytes that may be involved are epidermophytin and microsperm before we get into how to treat jock itch let's first look at some of the factors that increase your risk of getting jock itch jog itch is especially common in summers and rainy seasons because this leads to increased sweating and temperature which are ideal conditions for the fungi to grow if you wear tight fitting and synthetic clothes that occlude your body and prevent air circulation this also increases the risk of getting these fungal infections sharing towels or personal clothes with other people can also increase your risk personal hygiene is very important and habits like not bathing regularly and not breathing after sternous workout sessions or exercise also increases the risk of getting these fungal infections if you have untreated fungal infections at other parts of your body the fungi can spread from those areas to the groin and cause an infection having a weak immune system or diabetes also increases your risk of getting jock itch now let's talk about how jock itch or tina presents and what symptoms you can develop jock itch is typically found in the groin inner thighs or the anal region also it can be located on the lower abdominal area symptoms include itching and burning a red scaly circular rash with raised edges scaling flaking or peeling of skin in the infected region the rash usually begins with a reddish area of skin in the crease of the groin it often spreads to the upper thigh in a half moon shape the rash is usually ring shaped and can also have small blisters it may burn or feel itchy and the skin may be flaky or scaly if you visit a dermatologist they can confirm the diagnosis by performing a few simple tests the first basic test usually done is skin scraping test the doctor scrapes the edges of the rash and observes it under the microscope to check for the presence of fungi these skin scrapings can also be sent for fungal culture test in most cases the dermatologists can easily identify jock itch and they can promptly start the treatment without any tests now let's look at some lifestyle modifications you can implement that will help you to prevent jock itch in the first place keep your groin area dry dry your genital area and inner thighs thoroughly with a clean towel after showering or exercising also remember to dry your feet after taking a bath wear clean clothes change your underwear at least once a day or more often if you sweat a lot undergarments made of cotton or other fabrics that absorb moisture and keep the skin dry also help to prevent this infection always remember to wash your workout clothes after each use make sure your clothes fit correctly especially your undergarments avoid tight fitting clothes which can rub and irritate your skin and put you at an increased risk of jock itch try wearing boxer shorts rather than briefs don't share personal items don't let others use your clothing dolls or other personal items also don't borrow such items from others control any athlete's foot infection to prevent its spread to the groin area now if we look at the treatment itself it can be divided into topical antifungals which are applied over the skin and oral medication topical medications include soaps body washes lotions creams and gels we will look at them one by one and see which one is best for you topical antifungals are the first line of treatment for the patients of chocolate the most effective topical antifungals include drugs like azoles which include chloramazole ketoconazole oxyconazole and certaconazole another very effective category of drugs are allylamines like tobinophene and butanophine and there are some newer antifungal drugs also like cyclopirox and selenium sulfide which are proving to be very effective for the treatment of jog set you can start the treatment with a soap or body wash containing clottery muscle one percent or ketoconazole two percent and use that to wash your body every day when you apply the soap or the body wash make sure to leave it on for a few minutes before you wash it off so as to have the maximum antifungal effect you can also use cyglopidoxolamine or selenium sulfide body washes next we move on to the antifungal creams gels or lotions you should use again similar antifungal drugs are present in these creams and lotions like ketoconazole two percent chloramus all one percent laliconazole one percent eberconazole or certaconazole selenium sulphide 2.5 lotion and cyclopirox one percent cream are also very effective you should apply these creams and lotions twice daily once in the morning and once before sleeping i have provided the links to some of the best anti-fungal soaps body washes creams and lotions in the description box down below so make sure to check them out as per my experience as a dermatologist i have found lalal one percent cream selenium sulfide and cycloperoxolamine creams to be quite effective in the treatment of jock itch the treatment with these topical drugs should be continued for a minimum of four weeks if you have a mild infection and if you have a severe infection involving larger areas of the groin upper thighs or abdomen you should continue the topical treatment for at least six to eight weeks oral antifungal drugs are indicated in the case of extensive involvement of the skin and in patients who fail to respond to the topical therapy such as creams and lotions now there are three main fda approved anti-fungal drugs for the treatment of teenagers these are terbinophene etroconazole and fluconazole these drugs act by inhibiting certain enzymes in the fungi that are important for the fungi to synthesize their cell wall without a proper cell wall these fungi cannot grow and they soon die out out of these three fluconazole is mainly indicated for the treatment of vaginal candidiasis oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis while itaconazole and turbinophene are mainly used for the treatment of tinia and we will focus on them itrochonazole is available in 100 milligram 200 milligram and 400 milligram doses fourteen year crore is usually 100 milligram twice a day or 200 milligram once a day for two weeks is the minimum you should take this drug tabinofen is given as 250 milligram tablet daily for two to four weeks these drugs are usually not available over the counter so you need a prescription from a dermatologist while undergoing this treatment make sure to take proper care of your hygiene and wash your clothes regularly with hot water also make sure to iron your undergarments before each use as many of the times these fungal spores can get deposited on our inner wear clothes and this can cause frequent relapses and treatment failures so that was all about jock itch and its treatment in the coming videos we will discuss about tinea pedis tinea capitis and many other topics related to fungal infections as these are very common in today's population also i am going to make some videos regarding home remedies and natural methods to treat tinea infections so make sure to subscribe and hit the bell icon so you don't miss out on those videos thank you so much for watching if you found this video

        "video_sub_title": "hi i'm brian francis from Billy Beck the third personal training and performance center today I'm going to show you how to lift weights without injuring your neck with me here demonstrate is super trainer Lauren huff now the main reason most people enjoy their neck when they're lifting weights is to get out of neutral spine alignment and it's very simple to tell if you're a neutral spine alignment the main thing you ought to look for is where your ears are in relation to your shoulders so as long as your ears are over your shoulders it's going to be pretty hard to end your neck it's when people stray away from that that they get neck injuries from muscle and pigment and getting that spine at neutral alignment so we're going to show you too common movements that people do incorrectly and how to do them the right way so you don't injure your neck so the first one you see all over the gym is a lat pulldown and what people do is they pull the bar behind the head so again we're always trying to focus on that neutral spine alignment ears lined up right over the shoulders so as Lauren does this incorrectly if you look from the side you're going to see her ear two inches in front of her shoulder what that does is increase her risk of injury from muscle and pinch Minh so again don't pull behind the head what you're gonna do position that ear right over the shoulder you're going to pull right down to the front just as if you were doing a pull-up or a chin up it's the same exact movement occurring at the shoulder but now we have that neck in that neutral spine position so that's the first example second example that you see a lot of people do is they do an overhead press and they overextend the movement so what Lauren's going to do is a very simple overhead shoulder press with the pair of dumbbells and she's gonna do it correctly the first way do it correctly just for two repetitions so notice the position of her shoulders in relation to her neck now what she's going to do is overextend at the top so when she comes up you'll see extra elevation at her shoulders again we have no stability in the cervical spine when she's in this up extended position again placing you a very increased risk of injury for neck issues i'm brian francis and this has been how to lift weights without injuring the neck",

        "video_sub_title": "hey guys so today I did a look that is sort of like a sexy shimmery eye for a date for a fun night out anything like that I know Valentine's Day is coming up soon so this is a good option I think for when you want a bit of frost or shimmer but you don't want like a complete like foiled look or anything that's super in-your-face especially like they're going out on a date you know and you you still want to look like the person that the person asked out you know what I mean so this is a look that I do very often using The Naked 2 palette which is funny because this used to be my absolute least favorite Naked palette but it's actually turned into my favorite probably the last like six months a year so I don't know it has become definitely my favorite one I like it because I can use some of the silvers and some of the shimmery colors but they don't end up looking blue like a lot of silvery colors can do it's just a good mix I think of cool and warm shades and it works so this is a look that I have been meaning to do in a tutorial for a while now because it's just one of my go-to looks that I do if I'm going out at night or anything like that using this palette so I hope that you all enjoyed it and if you want to see how I did it thing keep watching alright so first to be used in a bit of my NARS Pro prime smudge-proof eyeshadow base just a tiny bit let that set for a few seconds and then I'm gonna use a very light base this is the NYX jumbo eyeshadow pencil and milk we're gonna smudge it out so you just want to feather it on that's probably actually too much these will crease if you really color them on too much you see that even when you blend then they keep a lot of their color so this just really is gonna help brighten up the shimmery shades that we put down pull a little on the inner corner as well I'm gonna start with my crease color and tease this is a e35 brush and I'm just gonna keep that right in the crease I don't want to get it too much on the light and then lightly kind of pull that up next I'm taking a knee 55 brush in this color called verb it's very silver the two colors and they use our verb and chopper for the shimmer putting down burr first because it's just a really light silvery shimmery color and then to keep that from looking too much or too like robot cuz I'm very funny about silver eye shadows I'm gonna then take that chopper color that I just showed so you keep the brightness of the silver but you get that sparkly Sheen as well or sparkly little flecks that that has I'm gonna take this color called busted and this is an e25 brush it's just a little more of a precise crease brush go put that right in the crease just a blend use that first crease brush to sort of blend around the edge to fini to take a little bit of that same color and put it right up under my lower lash line on the inner corner and I use this color called booty call and put it right there I take a little bit of this black on a pointy err crease brush just sort of swirl it right in that corner I'm gonna take this in that shade called foxy on a really big brush and just sort of lightly just put it right up under your brow just very subtle I'm gonna use my Stila eye liner pen and dark brown I'm gonna use the Too Faced better than sex mascara before I do my false lashes just to get my natural ones coated really well you're gonna use just the regular Ardell less bees and place them on that they're squeezed pretty closely to your very closely to your natural lash line all right so for the sake of keeping this pretty simple and you guys have seen me do this a million times especially lately since I did that tutorial about like bronzing and contouring and all that jazz I used the Too Faced chocolate Soleil the medium deep one I really loved that I used the Tarte blush and exposed gives you color without screaming like hot pink or brown or something that's too intense and on my lips I use the world lipliner well first I used my tony moly honey lip balm which I just love and it doesn't have a color to it I used it just very very lightly just to make my lips soft and then I used the world lip liner by Mac and this one actually you can make it work pretty dark or you can make it work as very natural so most days I just use this very it just works super naturals and then I wanted some color on my lips I didn't want them to be too bright and in-your-face I didn't want the texture to look too goopy or like not kissable so I used these that I really love these the Too Faced melted liquid lipsticks and the problem is is that the colors are a bit tricky for me it's just hard for me to find a color that I like totally on its own I really like the sugar one which is one of the new colors it's very very nude but I really love that one for when I want just like a totally like nude lip but I used the melted nude and it's a bit on the like orange Etan dark nude side so I actually mixed it with this other new color called melted frosting which is very very pink like pepto crazy pink and these are beautiful together so that's what I did so that's it for the tutorial I hope that y'all enjoyed it and that you have a very very good week weekend I'm not sure but I'm gonna post this but thank you guys for watching and I'll talk to you very soon bye",

        "video_sub_title": "hello and welcome back with my channel dental hygiene with Whitney today we're going to talk about just so you know cavities can also be called dental caries just so you know so let's just drink right in we're going to do five tips like five ways to get cavities starting with tip number one is brush and floss as previously stated in one of my videos I mentioned and I just remember mentioning to floss then brush then rinse with like a mouth rinse um I learned something recently and it may not be the best order there's no like best order usually however since we're talking about preventing cavities the best way may be to brush then floss then rinse so the reason behind that is you're brushing with a fluoride toothpaste right don't rinse with water and then spit out and then floss don't do that just brush with the floor in toothpaste you can spit but don't rinse keep that fluoride toothpaste on your teeth and men floss the idea being I'm at is that the floss is getting in between the teeth with the toothpaste and kind of putting that fluoride to help prevent cavities in between the teeth so maybe brushing them flossing then rinsing is a better option than what I said in my old video either way if you're flossing that's great but if you're trying to do the best thing ever maybe try the brush floss rinse does that make sense swish to your mouth with a fluoride rinse before but my favorite is it's um I just like it because it does not have that burning sensation but any anti cavity fluoride rinse will work I also have the Listerine purple one it's the anti cavity they're both great no joke I just prefer the apt because I don't like the burning sensation it makes my eyes water and I don't like the thing you need to know about the floor and mouth rinse we recommend that you use it before bed because you're supposed to wait 30 minutes before you eat or drink anything so you don't want to use it in the morning and then have your morning coffee because it's just gonna rinse it away you want that fluoride mouth rinse to sit on your teeth throughout the night so swish and go to sleep rinse with water drink water horns with water after you eat or drink because say you just had a graham cracker first I don't know why that can a graham cracker I like graham crackers with butter very good say you just have one of those in the chewing surfaces of your teeth all those little grooves if you don't already have Fillies or sealants bad graham crackers stuck in those little grooves on your chewing surface the more water the better throughout the day another thing about water it's better than drinking pop I know we all do it but just try to drink more water it helps prevent cavities the more water you drink the less other crappy stuff you drink we don't like sugars on our teeth all day number five get routine check-up x-rays at your dental appointments generally they do it once a year maybe for you they want them every six months that you're cleaning but kick them they're called bitewing x-rays you might hear a blood Wayne's bug lose today you do four bite wings get them they're so important it's the only way we're able to see in-between the teeth of any cavities are forming that we can't see clinically we can see them on the x-rays and before they get big we can take care of that the goal of x-rays is to benefit you not to hurt you a lot of people decline extras because they're concerned about radiation I get it but the amount of radiation you get for those four easy bite wings and especially if they're digital it's so minimal I think it's equal to eating a banana because banana has radiation truly it's so minimal there's research on the banana check it out they're really important we're just trying to help you get your x-rays this one kind of goes in conjunction what we were talking about with rinsing with water but basically this tip is cut down the sugar in your diet specifically fermentable carbohydrates now what is a fermentable carb I feel like in dental hygiene school that's all we talked about was fermentable carbs form interval carbs they're bad the thing about fermentable carbs is that they work with bacteria in your mouth to begin the decay process decay is a cavity cookies cakes some candies but the less obvious ones are bread crackers breakfast cereals thank you for watching I hope you learned something I hope you don't get any cavities please subscribe to my channel I hope you subscribe to my channel please",

        "video_title": "How To Put In and Take Out Contacts For Beginners | Contact Lens Insertion and Removal Training",
        "video_sub_title": "Are you new to wearing contact lenses? Maybe you\u2019ve worn them before and need a refresher on how to properly do so? Regardless of your experience level, below is a simple, step-by-step guide to putting in and taking out contact lenses! Putting In Your Contact Lenses: Step 1: Thoroughly wash your hands with soap and water. Step 2: Dry your hands with a clean towel. Step 3: Remove your contact lens from its package or case. Note: If you wear contact lenses stored in a case, rinse them off with contact lens solution. Step 4: Check to make sure your contact lens isn\u2019t inside out by doing one of the following: Option A: Look for a \u201cU\u201d over a \u201cV\u201d shape. Do this by placing the contact lens on the tip of your finger. Carefully assess the lens to make sure it makes a \u201cU\u201d shape. If it makes a \u201cV\u201d shape or flares out, it\u2019s inside out. Option B: Perform the \u201cTaco\u201d test. Do this by putting the contact lens between your pointer finger and thumb. Next, pinch the lens together and look to see if it makes the shape of a taco. If it appears the lens is bowing out, it\u2019s inside out. Option C: Look for number or branded laser markings on your contact lens. Place the lens on the tip of your finger and look for number or branded laser markings. If they\u2019re backward, your lens is inside out. *Not applicable for all contact lens brands. Step 5: Hold your upper eyelid with your alternate hand to prevent blinking. It\u2019s best to hold your eyelid as close to the white part of your eye as you can. Step 6: Use the hand you\u2019re putting in your contact lens with to pull down your lower eyelid. Again, it\u2019s best to hold your eyelid as close to the white part of your eye as you can. Step 7: Place the contact lens onto the front of your eye. Note: Some people find it easier to look up or down and place the contact lens onto the white part of their eye instead. Step 8: Release one eyelid THEN your other eyelid (but not both at the same time). From there, gently close your eyes and slowly move them around \u2013 this allows your contact lens to settle. Step 9: Open your eyes, blink a few times and enjoy clear, comfortable vision wearing your contact lenses! Things to remember: If a contact lens is irritating your eye after putting it in, take it out and make sure it\u2019s not inside out or defected. Also, keep in mind, astigmatism and multifocal contact lenses often take a couple minutes to settle for clear, comfortable vision! Taking Out Your Contact Lenses: Step 1: Thoroughly wash your hands with soap and water. Step 2: Dry your hands with a clean towel. Step 3: Fill your contact lens case with fresh contact lens solution. Note: You can skip this step if you wear daily contact lenses. Step 4: Hold your upper eyelid with your alternate hand to prevent blinking. It\u2019s best to hold your eyelid as close to the white part of your eye as you can. Step 5: Use the hand you\u2019re taking out your contact lens with to pull down your lower eyelid. Again, it\u2019s best to hold your eyelid as close to the white part of your eye as you can. Step 6: Slide the contact lens off the center of your eye using your pointer finger. Step 7: Pinch the contact lens between your thumb and pointer finger and remove it from your eye. Step 8: Place the contact lens in your contact lens case for proper storage. Note: You can place your contact lens in the trash if you wear daily contact lenses. That\u2019s it! You\u2019re now ready to put in and take out your contact lenses like a pro! If you have any questions, make sure to talk with your eye care professional. Good luck!",

        "video_sub_title": "are you dealing with fluid-filled clogged and congested ears that might be leaving you with a little tinnitus even vertigo and just a lot of frustrations that your ears are not cleared and you've got fluid behind the eardrum or in the middle ear and today's video I'm going to share with you a proven super simple step-by-step process protocol that I created just for you to help you drain your ears naturally I'm clogging them and opening up your hearing and making you feel better stay tuned for this informative step-by-step video [Music] welcome back everybody I'm dr. Melissa Gallagher I'm a naturopathic physician if you are new to us and just joining this channel welcome I hope you'll subscribe for more great health tips here in today's video I'm seeking to answer a ton of your viewer questions I have two videos that total over a half a million views on clogged congested plugged ears and many of those comments on those videos are taking this video a step further and digging into how to drain the ear tube your eustachian tubes and to get rid of excess fluid that might be in behind the eardrum in the middle ear space so I'm going to give you a four part step-by-step process here in this video these steps are included in my ear draining protocol this has another v very important step that if you want to download this this is available for 495 online I'll have a link where you can buy that down below so most importantly one of the first things that you want to do is to actually help your ear joints drain so most of you probably don't even realize that we actually have joints in between the three bones in your ear these three bones are connected in a hinge like fashion and those hinges the joint sockets that's called our ocular joint this joint is what we want to lubricate and open up because a lot of times when there's congestion fluid and even pressure there can be congestion of that joint which causes tinnitus and the changes in your equilibrium your balance and can cause inflammation in that area when we really want to get that fluid drained the most impactful step in this protocol is to grab oil of oregano this is super super powerful potent it is considered a hot oil and I've had a lot of people comment about whether or not you can put this on your body what you're going to be doing in this protocol is actually applying the oil to the outer lobe and just right back behind ear I'm gonna demonstrate that for you so what you're going to do with your oil of oregano is you're going to put one drop on your finger and what I do is I just put my fingers together and on both your so it doesn't matter if you're dealing with one ear or the other ear typically it's it's both are gonna be fluid filled but even if it's one side both sides are going to help open up the canals of your ear so your city eustachian tubes are actually going to open up the power of oregano oil is so amazing because it gets through the skin layers and helps to break up fluid in the synovial joint those three little bones I mentioned they are hinged and connection to each other the joints often when we have a lot of pressure a lot of fluid buildup and we have a loss of hearing or even vertigo those joints actually get immobilized by the build-up and inflammation of the synovial fluid so not only do you have eustachian tube fluid you have joint fluid that we need to eradicate by applying oregano oil on the earlobe and I just use circles like this this kind of Circle Circle Circle up and around really motivate it just on the outer ear lobe that is how you can apply oil of oregano now the other thing that is really important there's a little spot back behind here so it's just back behind your the bottom part of your earlobe I just do a quick little swab back a little swap and this is on both sides so I'm doing a little demonstration here for you so that you can see this and again my step by steps are highlighted in my protocol something you can always print out and have accessible so that you don't have to watch this video all the time but by doing a little rub on your earlobe and just swabbing the back that is going to flush and help drain those joints of excess fluid and inflammation actually help make them more mobilize that actually gets those joints moving and that helps them respond better to pressure that's actually in the ear that therefore helps drain your ears better so that's step one step two is moving the lymphatics of your head your neck and the throat area there's really two steps to this the first is to use a dry skin brush on the skin I'm going to highlight some videos we can get more detailed in-depth info but essentially what you want to do is you want to start on the left clavicle do circular pattern dry bristle brush Circle Circle Circle Circle just below the clavicle on both left and right five and then what you're going to do is little sweeps just above the clavicle bone and then sweeping from the ear point down the pressure simply is putting the brush on your neck and just sweeping down you don't have to do any type of major exfoliating this brush is already rough and I have sensitive skin so it is going to cause my skin to turn red that's totally normal but you don't need to go rubbing so what you want to do is you want to continue along dry skin brushing the whole back of the neck and ideally you want to go to your hairline and brush down okay so brush down brush down at the base of your neck you want to do circles and then sweep to that area you're gonna be doing this on both left and right sides that's when you're going to put the dry skin brush down and you're going to use your finger so if you have just applied the oil you want to cleanse your hands because is we're gonna oil as a hot oil you don't want it near your eyes you don't want in your your lips or your nasal passages so I've cleaned my hands I'm going to show you a quick way to drain the lymphatics of your head draining the lymphatics of your ears nose and throat will help move the excess fluid that is sitting in the sinus cavity causing pressure in the ear and it'll clear the eustachian tubes that's causing pressure and build up an ear so there's a lot of stuff kind of going on sinus lies up in this sinus cavity up in this sinus cavity and then a lot of times if you have any type of fluid in ears there's going to be lymph node involvement along the chin line this will all get that moving so you want to do sweeps from the inside of your nose down to your ear and then down sweeps from your nose to your ear and then down so two fingers put at the corner of your nose sweep to your earlobe and down to the clavicle just be doing that in that motion sweep down sweep down yeah and then you do a light fluttering so you can take one or two fingers while your fluttering up right here right above the nose that little bone here in between your eyebrows sweep sweep sweep up and then you'll be doing this down and around I'm getting sinus drainage by doing that so as you do this don't be surprised if your ear canal your eustachian tube starts draining that drains into the back of the throat that's when you're gonna know you're getting fluid moving even your popping as I'm getting now I don't have any fluid in my ear but I'm moving the fluid this is fantastic for all of you who might be prone to ear infections sinus congestion it's also really good just to keep the lymphatics moving in your body because moving the lymphatics will keep your ears your nose your throat and your whole entire head clear of excess lymphatic fluid it'll keep your body healthier and what you're doing is by moving your lymphatics you're enhancing your immune system so not only are you going to be dry skin brushing and moving lymphatics with a gentle lymphatic massage of the head I also recommend in my protocol using the homeopathic lymph stem that's a lymphatic motivator homeopathic dropper that's a fantastic way to get things moving step number three is to incorporate sinus draining so what is sinus draining that's using a neti pot or like a saline spray literally into the nostrils sinus neti potting is where you're putting a distilled water solution in this and you can also do a Himalayan salt inhaler this is another alternative if you are not a big fan of doing neti potting or not a fan of the saline spray no saline sprays work out really well for children I recommend that for use with infants and children really up to the age of 10 to 12 who then can move on to nutty potting but it's okay if you're an adult to use the saline spray as well the advantage of using a neti pot is fantastic for clearing out the drainage the fluid that's stuck behind your ear because a lot of the drainage issues have to do with pathogenic exposure candida fungus yeast allergens viral and bacterial matter what the natty bobbing is going to do is it's going to help clear out the gunky mucus that's harboring these pathogens and it can help minimize the inflammation and irritation of the sinus passages now in my protocol I bump up the power of a neti pot with things like colloidal silver and even an Eddy wash that you can add to the saline solution that's just going to give it a power punch of immune boosting anti-inflammatory properties that are going to help minimize the impact of the upper and the lower sinuses and causing fluid congestion you can have mucosal build-up that's going to cause fluid congestion so Nettie potting is a great thing to have in your arsenal the fourth healing aspect of my protocol is to incorporate inflammatory reducing herbs in your day to day routine you guys probably hear me talk a lot about ginger and turmeric tea or tumeric tea I love to incorporate those daily because wine is hot and very warming very clearing of the sinus passages - turmeric and ginger have very strong anti-inflammatory properties and then when you're consuming them in a live tea form you're going to get a major potency of those properties you can also incorporate things like inflamed X which is really great that encapsulates those inflammatory properties inflammation of your passages of the ear nose and throat the ear drum itself can be inflamed some of the reason why we get the fluid in the first place can be from the inflammation within the ear tubes and the ear drum and then also the sinus passages so this is a very multifaceted approach to managing the fluid that your body's retaining now there's also a fifth element that I include in my protocol this is targeted at minimizing the pathogens and pathogenic exposure bacterial viral Candida yeast mold exposure that you're dealing with as well as boosting your immune system so I incorporate these three items in detail step-by-step how to use them how much to use and how they can be quite impactful in your body and these can also add to the 4-step so friends I hope you give this protocol a try these four steps will greatly enhance the fluid flow and draining of your ears if you need a little bit more impactful work I'm going to include a link for my ear draining protocol that features step number five that gets into enhancing the immune power of your body to get rid of pathogenic exposure and it also features how to boost your ear nose and throat oral biotic activity by incorporating a really good probiotic that I know will be helpful friends as always I want to thank you for your viewership I'm so grateful for your time I know that these four steps and that fifth one I include in the protocol are going to greatly help you deal with your current fluid-filled situation if you have any questions please message me below so thank you for your time and I will see you on Friday's video have a great day everybody [Music]",

        "video_sub_title": "[Music] restoring needs are breathing in the vast majority of people and children it's very easy to do a child breeds through the mouth or an adult breech through the mouth generally for one reason they breathe through their mouth if they feel air hunger while breathing through the nose what causes air hunger air hunger can be caused either by rhinitis that the nose is stuffy or it could be allergic rhinitis that child or adult is a fever or for instance they could have a head cold or they could have a mechanical obstruction to the nose or you could have a child for example with a large light noise at the back of the noses obstructed or quite simply the child or adult could have developed a poor breathing pattern that the response rate is quite fast and that their breathing in excess of what they should be over breathing and if you're over breathing and if you're trying to breathe through your nose you may feel a our hunger because the amount of air that one is breathing is too high so really what we want to do is to it mist or nasal breathing quote in children and others is to decongest the nose first it's very very easy don't do this exercise of the female is pregnant if you've got cardiovascular issues or if you got serious ill health however it's just involving cooling of the breasts to decongest the nose you can take a small breath in through your nose a small breath out through your nose you pinch your nose with your fingers and walk around while you hold your breath if you hold your breath on an exhalation and walk around and you continue walking and holding your breath until you feel say a medium to strong air hunger then let go and breathe in through your nose rest diminish with normal breathing and repeat it again and repeat it five times your nose will have opened up that's how we restore nasal breathing we first have to determine can we remove the obstruction can we have to decongest the nose and yes we can and very understudied fields you know this is been written about since 1923 in that bread falling in man resulted in reduction of nasal obstruction so we know that when when human beings when we do breath falling or when we do a physical exercise with mat closed it's going to increase a gas called carbon dioxide in the blood and it may be the increase of co2 in the blood that helps to open up the nose but also happy to branch on we're holding our breath and at the same time nitric oxide is continuously released into the nasal cavity and it may be that nitric oxide could be playing some role another aspect may be that should buy me more direct we're activating the body's sympathetic response or stress response and that may be helping to open up the nose so anybody with nasal obstruction in the vast majority of cases we can help you open up your nose and restore nasal breathing under permanent basis try that simple exercise I repeated your nose should be opening up that will temporarily decongest your nose your nose will be more permanently free when you're both score which is the body oxygen level test reaches about 25 seconds so if somebody comes in to me with nasal congestion I would say don't listen I can give you an exercise which will you know we're pretty much guaranteed this is how will help open up your nose if you've got any fever if you've got perennial rhinitis if you've just got nasal congestion nasal stuffiness runny nose we can help however you'll get a much more permanent result when you switch to nose breathing on a permanent basis when you practice the various breathing exercises that we teach and when you're all score increases your nose is much less likely to get congested this is what our auntie histamines without nasal steroids this is without any medication to help open up the nose that's simply by changing your breathing patterns you can open up your nose try it [Music]",

        "video_title": "KT Tape: Shin Splints- Posterior",
        "video_sub_title": "This application is for posterior shin splints-  where the pain often is located in the anterior or front,  and slightly medial portion of the shin. This is often due to overuse of the posterior tibialis muscle which is actually on the backside of the tibia. muscle which is actually on the backside of the tibia. This application is more for pain relief versus functional correction. One of the most common areas for shin splints is actually along the inner lower leg. And if I placed a dot approximately where  pain typically occurs.  This can vary from person to person:  higher, lower, front, or back.  What I am going to have you do is tear a strip of tape off the roll. We are going to split that into a Y-strip by folding it down on the perforation  and then tearing down the tape.  And it will stop at the anchor. Let\u2019s go ahead and tear the paper off the back of the tape now at the anchor-  which is the logo end of the tape.  Now place that anchor 2-3 inches below that site of pain. Now lets go ahead and rub that on really well...  And from here-  what you can do is just peel  the paper off the back of one of the legs all the way down to the last inch  and a half or so, and now grab that so there is still paper on there.  Holding the anchor you are going to put that tape on full stretch just going next to  that site of pain, and with this hand go ahead and lay that tape down.  If you go up by your knee joint you can just go ahead and lay down that anchor with no tension. (go ahead and lay that down\u2026 ok, rub that spot down)  Ok, lets go ahead and take the other piece off- same thing, leave the last inch and a half and go around that site of pain. You can put that tape on stretch and bend  right around that site if you would like. Laying that tape down.  And that last bit of tape- the last two inches or so again, lay that tape down without any tension.  Lets go ahead and rub that on well with the paper backing (actually very helpful). And now I will have you tear another piece of tape off this roll. Again split that into a Y-strip by  folding it down the center and tearing it right down to the anchor.  And you are going to remove the paper backing.  Ok, this is important- what I want  you to do is anchor on skin on the back of the leg at about the level of the site of pain.  Make sure that anchor is on there well.  From here you are going to take that  paper strip just like we did the first strip you are going to leave an inch and  a half- and you are going to pull  with good tension on that piece.  Again going around that site of pain,  and you can go up the leg and lay that down or across the leg. Ok, the same thing with this second piece.  Now you are going just above the site  of pain this time putting good  tension on the tape.  No tension on the anchor and good  tension at the site of pain and then  laying that tape down again with no tension.  Rub that on creating a little friction. That heat from the friction does help  the tape adhere better.  I like to get down by the anchor  really good, just to make sure- that\u2019s kind of a very flexible point  that needs extra adherence, and that\u2019s the application for posterior shin splints.",

        "video_sub_title": "[MUSIC PLAYING] --show you how to create a really cool smoky eye using Masterpiece Colour Precision Eye Shadow. And I really love this, because it's kind of like a smoky, silvery gray color, so it works perfectly smudged in with a Black Kohl Pencil-- very, very sexy, very modern again. Because we're using a cream eye shadow, you get that lovely kind of shimmery effect to it. So we're going to apply Stardust very simply from the applicator starting in the inner corner of the eye all the way across the lid. Again, you don't have to worry about being too precise-- no eye shadow falls down-- onto your beautiful base. Just do that lovely kind of half moon shape and, again, just blend in with your finger like so. And if Mona looks up for me, just take the applicator right underneath the lashes, right to the inner corner. And, again, at the inner corner of the eye, that's when you get that lovely kick of light. And it really does wonders for the eye shape. It really brings out the overall shape of the eye. So again, just a little bit underneath on the outer corner, so you get that lovely smoky finish. And it's as simple as that. It's really, really pretty and really reflective. So what we're going to do to add the drama to the eye is just use a little bit of Black Kohl Pencil just around the bed of the lashes. And you want to take the pencil just to the base of the lash line all the way around. With this look, you don't have to be too precise. That's the wonderful thing about it. And you take your finger, and you blend it in to the cream eye shadow. And as the cream eye shadow dries-- look up for me-- it all sets together. Take the Kohl right to the outer corner of the eye. And again, smudge it on just at the last lash. And again, use your finger or a cotton bud just to smudge very softly the Black Kohl at the outer corner of the eye. That's what gives it that lovely kind of doe-eyed finish. So we're going to finish off with False Lash Effect Mascara. This is an obvious choice for this. Look up for me. Instantly, you get these great, thick lashes coming out of the smoky eye. It's just such a simple way to create a smoky eye. If you're working with a lot of eye shadows, gets a bit messy, a bit fiddly. But with these eye shadows, it makes everything so much more easier and much more trendy as well. So the last little thing to my look is, after the mascara, I'm going to use a little bit of the Kohl Pencil just inside the inner rim of your eye.",

        "video_title": "Why Do I Have Tonsil Stones?",
        "video_sub_title": "A sore throat can be a sign of all kinds of medical maladies. You might have caught a cold from your coworkers, or just cheered too loudly at the big game last night. But if it feels like there\u2019s an irritating lump in your throat, there might actually be something stuck back there: a whitish-yellowish tonsil stone. These hard globs come from the food bits, dead cells, and other junk in your mouth. But even though they might be a little weird and uncomfortable and gross, they\u2019re not really dangerous. Your tonsils are part of your lymphatic system. They work with a bunch of other tissues to get rid of waste, and fight off infections. There are actually three different groups of tonsils, but tonsil stones mostly show up in the palatine tonsils The palatine tonsils are those two squishy patches at the back of your throat that you can see in the mirror if you open your mouth wide enough. The palatine tonsils are full of tonsillar crypts, which are deep folds of tissue that are designed to lure in bacteria and maximize the amount of tissue that those bacteria touch. That way, lots of immune cells can be exposed to potential pathogens, and start to build up a targeted immune response with antibodies to fight them off. Unfortunately, when you have cozy crevices for bacteria, sometimes they get a little too comfortable. These crypts can collect dead cells, extra mucus, and food debris or other particles that somehow end up in your mouth \u2013 which provide a delicious breeding ground for lots of different microbes. After a film of bacteria forms, these goopy lumps can start to calcify, becoming hard structures made of calcium and other minerals. The solid lumps that form are called tonsil stones, or tonsilloliths. Tonsil stones can vary in size from a couple millimeters to a couple centimeters. Sometimes people just swallow them, or sometimes they stick around and can irritate your throat. Some bacteria that have been found on tonsil stones produce lots of sulfur compounds, which might cause bad breath. But that\u2019s usually the worst of it. It\u2019s really rare for tonsil stones to get big enough to be dangerous and make swallowing painful or difficult. If you want to get rid of them, you can try to pop them out using a brush or some gargling. Or you can go to an ear, nose, and throat doctor for extra help. Tonsil-removing surgery is a last resort, if these chunks form all the time, or become severely irritating. Other than surgery, there\u2019s not much you can do to stop tonsil stones from forming. They\u2019re just one of those weird things your body does sometimes. But at least they\u2019re not dangerous.

Jerry Sherrod your skin expert for today let's talk about hair fall which is a complete nightmare for a whole lot of people so what are the causes of hair fall the most important cause today is stress it could be physical stress lack of sleep lack of adequate rest very bad lifestyle or it could be mental stress where one is overloaded with work or it's a personal stress which can cause a hormonal change and result in a lot of hair loss the other causes causes genetics so if there is a family history it comes down the genes and then you have hair loss the third cause of hair fall something which you are deficient in iron deficiency biotin deficiency protein deficiency most importantly remember there are hair are made up of keratin and keratin F is nothing but four so be very very careful about what you eat you must have a very high protein diet a diet which has minerals you know biotin in it you can also take supplements of biotin and proteins the fourth course is an illness so if you suffered from any illness like say a typhoid or malaria or even a viral fever there is a damage that occurs eventually and the hair fall starts approximately two months after the illness and it goes on for a couple of months so there you will need some vitamin supplements once again if you've undergone any kind of surgery that's against rest of the body so that's when you will see that you're losing hair again similarly post pregnancy exactly about two to three months after pregnancy but you find that the person is losing a lot of hair that condition is known as telogen effluvium and that happens due to a hormonal change in the body so that's when you must again take supplements iron calcium b-complex biotin and proteins and do not panic another reason could be some drugs that you're taking so if you're taking some steroids or some anti-thyroid drugs or even anti-cancer drugs of course will cause a lot of care for people who are suffering from a liver disease or even from thyroid we most commonly experience a lot of hair fall a lot of times people who come from other cities suddenly see that there is a lot of hair fall that could be due to the water you know when you have certain chemicals minerals and magnesium and fluorides and a lot of lead content in the water it does lead to headphone and then of course don't forget all these treatments like performing straightening frequent coloring will make the hair brittle and you will end up in some sort of breakage of the hair shaft and there will be hellos if you have any comments or any problems regarding hair fall you can post them here you can subscribe to skin finiti and you can tweet to me my handy is at Jesse shuddered take care",

        "video_sub_title": "hi I'm dr. David Hill and today we're going to talk about how to get rid of post nasal drip and cough what do we mean when we say post nasal drip well it's pretty straightforward the nose is connected to the back of the throat and when you get a runny nose the mucus and secretions drip down the back of the throat that can be really annoying it can cause some sore throat and as that stuff drips down into the lungs you have a reflex to COFF it back up and get it out of the lungs so post nasal drip can also cause cough getting rid of it depends on what is the cause there are several things that can cause post nasal drip the most common is probably a cold medicine we call that a viral upper respiratory infection or a viral Rhino sinusitis and really the only thing to do for that is wait until it's over rest will help a vaporizer man make you or your child more comfortable if they're having this some adults find help with a neti pot which is like this tea pot it almost looks like a like a genies Lantern and use it to introduce a little bit of saline or salt water up into the nasal passages that can help open them up and wash them out a little bit but don't overdo that either anything can be overdone so several times a day is fine but every five minutes is probably way too much in children the use of the neti pot has not been as well studied and very few children are able to really tolerate it and cooperate adequately with it now in young infants you can use a little bit of nasal saline just a little salt water dribbled in the nose two or three drops and sucked back out after a few seconds with a suction bulb which may help clear the nasal passages now if you're running stuffy nose and call for coming from a sinus infection how do you know well they've probably been going on for more than 10 to 14 days you may have had a fever for greater than three days or a fever greater than 104 degrees in these cases we often use antibiotics whether the antibiotics work is another question all together in children there's some evidence that antibiotics can help with a bacterial sinus infection like I just described in adults the evidence not as good so while we do it frequently you might talk to your doctor and say hey are you really sure this is going to help now if this is from allergies there are some great allergy medicines out there the best are the nasal sprays with steroids in them fluticasone or Flo nice is now over it's not over the counter but it is check so it's inexpensive and it works fantastic but there are several other competing brands most of them are more expensive because they're still branded but they work great an antihistamine can be a helpful medicine as well the most common in popular right now are cetirizine zyrtec or loratadine which is sold branded as claritin so you can use those they don't tend to make people quite as drowsy as some of the older antihistamines and they last longer it may be difficult to tell which thing you've got you may have two or three going on at once so if you're a post nasal drip and call for not getting better relatively quickly or if there's something unusually severe about them for gosh sake check with your doctor and see what needs to be done talking about relieving post nasal drip and cough on dr.

        "video_sub_title": "[Music] hey everybody its Ryan here your personal trainer here online talking about knee pain knee problems and more specifically quadricep tendonitis I have a pretty good amount of experience with quadricep tendinitis specifically with me and that case would be my own self diagnosis so keep in mind that a lot of my ideas are based on my experience and might not necessarily apply to you but take them as a grain of salt and maybe consider some of the ideas I share that maybe help you in your own journey towards becoming stronger with your squat benches and deadlifts and also it's trying to solve knee pain so tonight is characterized as inflammation of a tendon or inflammation of an area in this case it\u00eds tendinitis that's why it's called tendinitis in a tendon this is my quadricep wall up my leg here and you can see my quad so you can see my media as latter dollas got some good muscle mass there and you can see that there is the patella and these must of the quadricep the four muscles Steve medialis lateralis rectus femoris and intermedius all come together to form this common tendon called a quadricep tendon and it attaches to the top of the patella and the knee pain that I have that comes and goes from time to time is a this is a basically shooting pain on top of the patella right here at the attachment point I can really feel it kind of hurts so when I squat what will happen is I'll squat down and then I'll come up I'll squat down and when I come up what will happen is I'll get a little shock not feeling anything right now but it's very common that I'll get pain there when I squat when I do some squats typically if I have 135 not really hundredths ever like 185 pounds or more and what's interesting enough when I get up to a certain point like 300 pounds the pain kind of goes away I know but the problem is that that sort of doesn't make any sense well I guess it does because that probably means I'm using more of my my glutes and I'm using more of my hips adductors maybe unless than my quads was just probably why my quadriceps so my undestand bothered me as much at heavier weights but it definitely does kind of make me tentative when I squat so I want to share with you kind of what I do to kind of solve some of these problems or minimize them one thing is wrapping up your knees using an e-wrap these are actually quite effective now I don't use them in the way that met I don't know depends on what audience you are whether you're a power lifter or you're just trying to solve your own problems in the joints is that people who use knee wraps when they do power lifting typically wrap them pretty much freaking tight so tight you lose circulation within just a few seconds or your circulation drops considerably I don't wrap my knees very tight I just wrap them to say very small I don't know if there will be like a radiancy I'll be like a medium and the purpose of that is I use them as just kind of a mild support if I wanted more support I wouldn't make them tighter but my goal is not to become you know really strong with a knee wrapped it's really just meant there's a support system to prevent my honestly my need from hurting because before I started using a traditional like power lifter wrap for a classic raw and then you you spla powerlifting Federation I would use a Buddha floss man as an e-wrap and just to briefly show you kind of what I do is that what I'll do is I'll wrap my top of my leg like this and I'll make this pretty tight maybe about this is what I got from Kelly Starrett and this is a mobility WOD band I will just make it pretty tight about 70% so like this is a hundred percent and I'll pull back a little bit and then wrap so again it's 100% but 70% and wrap and what I'll do is I'll just keep wrapping so I'll wrap a little higher up and what I'm doing is I'm basically cutting circulation a little bit different than then the doing this is actually meant of support and what I'll do is I'll squat with it if you've seen some of my squat videos I'll use it with I use it with my squats as two reasons one is support and what I've noticed that when I really make this tight and I really wrap this up there's no need paint so for whatever reason what I think happens is that it basically it compresses the muscle right the muscle tissue and makes it so there's more support around the knee or the muscles around the the quadricep and the Hampshire insertions right here are able to fire better and then when I squat and makes it so that that tendon doesn't take so much stress because a big part of the reason for my owners means that the tenant essentially gets too much tension on it like because you just imagined a piece of cable right and we'll use as analogous as a muscle and certain points of the cable get more stress than the others some people will argue and they will say like oh well if you pull a one it pulls on everything well you know again this is all experience so based information this is not like a necessarily scientific study understand that I know that when I wear a wrap or wrap my knees even if it's just a little bit the pain basically goes away and when then when I take it off it hurts and I just and then interestingly enough when I when I squat and it starts to hurt I wrap it up squat with the wraps take off the wraps squat again the knee is come other than the knee pain the quadricep tendon itis is completely gone why does it go away I have no idea to be totally honest I just know that works it works for me and you could do a lot of different things so the whole purpose of the the Moodle floss ban actually is really to restrict blood flow so that way when you take it off you can kind of see like how the it's like red there or everything's kind of dissipating now is that it makes kind of a customer like a pump makes air so when you when you reduce circulation to the area of the thought of the the quad when you start doing exercise like squats and then you take it off it makes the blood rush to the area so you give them a blood flow in the area so that's one way that I think helps a lot again again that's why there's a reason why Kelly Starrett calls these the Voodoo floss of the Bands their Voodoo so it's kind of funny how it works out that way but again there's lots of different things out there and I know that for me that's sort of what works I'll use sometimes I'll use this and this is kind of like what's interesting because I remember what Jason Blaha saying that using knee wraps is dangerous for the kneecap because it presses on the kneecap and can actually cause more pain and if you use it to like completely wrap your legs so tight that you can barely move it and it hurts well then I can see that being dangerous over time and really bad for the knee but if you use it as kind of a mild support I really think you can help the knee because one thing I also learned again not not necessarily scientific is that we saw these uh these knee wraps or none you just need this knee sleeve we sell to gyms like ninety bucks it's through Bayer Bey a bear but I forgot the name of the brand but I'll leave a link in the description soon as soon as I put this video together is that what it does it says base it's sort of like a the rehab knee sleeves that we use in powerlifting or Olympic lifting to be very popular amongst CrossFitters is that when you wear them it this particular knee sleeve I'm talking about or new support is meant to give you just the right amount of pressure to kind of activate the tissue around it so that it's it's like it's like what's think about it's like wearing a belt but not wearing it tight and that's kind of what's designed to do and what this nice Neve does it kind of increases proprioception and I think when I wear one of these uh well ooh to floss man or knee wraps and again not super tight just mildly mild support I think that what happens is it allows the muscle to basically just become more aware of itself and interestingly enough it doesn't I think that's another reason why people feel like they get a performance boost when they do when they were compression pants because it kind of helps improve proprioception now how much does it help I don't know how much it might not help a lot but I think it might get people warmed up much faster because kind of you have a sort of a signal to the brain when something's being pressed like just imagine like think about this I'm sitting here right talking about the human body and I want you're watching this video and I just think about your left calf right and think about the bottom of your left calf can you feel that muscle can you feel that can you feel your leg can you think about that the area in your calf now I'm thinking about this area right here it doesn't really matter where it is but the whole idea is that because you thought about it you put some effort into it it was there's support there or some I don't know how well you I guess there's proprioception there I don't know you would call it but imagine if you had something wrapped around there there's gonna be almost like a faster signal that's going to that area because you have something wrapped around it again I find that this stuff works for me I don't know if it's necessarily gonna work for you you don't have to believe in it it's kind of like meditation I hear so many good things about meditation how beneficial it is but I mean some people think it's just voodoo magic and it's just BS but again to his to her own whatever you want to call it you can have your own how you want to believe but I'm just sharing my ideas I kind of what works for me and I found that this is how I use it not again not wrapping super tight so that it causes issues in the knee but it's more so in a sense that it creates better proprioception and I think that's one of the reasons why my rapping technique or the way I use the raps help and then all I say wrapping technique it just means I'm just wrapping it enough to give some mild support not so tight like a powerlifter where I'm trying to get the most out of the wraps which is not what I use them for and then again for the roof lost man is a way to kind of help improve warm-up and blood flow to areas that have irritation on occasion anyways

case they should really bring overalls back hey those were sexy oh speaking of remember when Justine that Chris Christina when Christina remember when Christina Aguilera went dirty I've always thought they're cute on other people but I would never pull like a Katy Perry hair cuz that's too crazy if I were to dye my hair one crazy color it'd probably be green like Denise wanted so every once in a while whenever I feel like I want to go and I want to wear you know like 20 inch long tensions oh yeah these babies these are my true rubble extensions I actually have a pair of washed month so they're still trying but I'll show you what anyone look like is this burn well I guess we're dyeing your hair brown I actually wore these extensions in a photo shoot that I instagrammed [Music] I'm not gonna talk boy you talk about this because I'm gonna show you the really cool ones but I'll do an open yeah I'll do an open box for you we Filipinos get our P's and F's mixed up all the time pipette button oh you got a new cell phone oh I'm still on that pager there are a hundred percent real human hair treating it like it's your own hair except it's not I wonder whose it is it's mine now girl look how not her that looks like even if it's dark brown it fades too like an hombre personally my opinion I think that clip-on extensions are way better than glue-in extensions because remember when I had that hair crisis I thought Benji's hair can get matted pretty badly now I know how Britney Spears feels like oops that girl did it again but uh so I got two pairs of extensions just in case one is in the dryer hmm you get a really long piece a semi longi and you have the ones that fit around the side and you have four mini ones for the side now I don't use all of it because my hair is so thick I'm gonna look like I've got a bigger head and that's tiny but if you're wondering what color this is it's the Express so ombre if it is 120 grams if you're curious that's a lot of hair but enough hair for the needy that's how thick it is but the ones I want to show you guys a tutorial on look how funky these colors are blue color trips are so soft mmm smells like Pantene I just washed them in the tutorial for you guys having worn these on and off for two months just makes me feel like I'm sixteen again yeah so I got three shades I picked out this blonde one which is in my hair right now I got a turquoise one which is my favorite I think it's great because I don't have to bleach my hair cuz I remember what the last time I bleached my hair you don't want to mess with one stick hair it took me a year to get my hair to be this way again ain't never going back to beach but I do prefer my hair straight or curly with them but before I show you guys on how to apply them or is my room again being purple this thing puts the up and suck okay so the reason why I got these extensions is because of these extensions so I got these from Sephora for like 25 bucks or something ripoff I know and I saw this really cool and bright hair color for so for 25 bucks at Sephora you got something that's two grams do you hear clicking noise like hello get Bassel to the clip aqua mate won't snap and trust me I've tried all tricks to make it snap it just snap if I lost the receipt and I can't return it and basically it's just pointless that's what I always wanted to do to weigh so here's a tutorial on how you can wear them mix and match them for pretty much any occasion [Music] okay so applying clip in extensions is actually very simple fast and easy so like normal you would straighten your hair first just so that it's easier to place extensions wherever you want it after prepping your extension part a layer of your hair so that you can hide the clips very well and you might want to put hairspray above the part and tease it from the top instead of underneath just so you can have the clips grip and won't slide off then you just place the clip oddities and listen for the snap to make sure that it's clipped in now you can put as many as you want but I prefer to you just want to hide the hair over and straighten it just to blend it there's so many different colors to choose from [Music] so like I said the are 100% human hair so I usually wash them every twice of you see look at the website there's actually like a shampoo and conditioner you can use but I don't have any of that so I just use what I have at home so mine will smell like my own hair and not like medicines the website oh I did get a mock this website right it's great that they have a lot of colors you can choose from too and not only did it get to me pretty fast but shipping is free so you can check it out maybe get yourself a discount a checkup Wow so yeah that's where I've been rocking for this summer or I gotta go to my kickboxing class now Google I kick button there's actually a lot of thick crannies during that class but ain't no way grannies gonna kick higher than me it's so gay in front of this granny I [Applause] think I pulled a groin muscle",

        "video_sub_title": "hi I'm dr. Robert HS I'm an at cedars-sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles I'd like to talk to you today about how to fight allergies that caused an itchy nose and that's very appropriate for me because my last name is Isis you dropped the Ian yet and and itchy nose is what I live with and live for and lived because of and people come to see me about and then she knows makes you do some things and makes you go like that sometimes or you could go like that or like that or like that it's it's all some people think they're like ticks they're not ticks their their allergies and why do you have it you have it because there are allergy cells in your nose called allergy mast cells they release chemicals that like histamines and luca trying to make you itch that's the process so the deal is how are we going to reduce this how are we going to deal with this how are we going to make this less of an issue well one thing would be decreased exposure so you know you could be the boy in the bubble and live in a bubble and you'd have less exposure but I don't know if that's practical you could decrease exposure possibly by moving to the ocean and that is nice and that's not always practical either sometimes there are seasons that are worse like spring times worse but so let's let's put you stuck in a situation where you have outdoor exposure whether or not you like it even when you're indoors and it's in the springtime and you have that itchy nose so what are you going to do about it well one thing you can do is you can use medications there are over-the-counter medicines that are like antihistamines and sometimes decongestants that you take orally not don't use a decongestant as a nasal spray that causes new problems and though what they'll do is they'll calm the allergy cells down so you have less allergy symptoms now if those don't work you might look at medicines that are prescriptive there are other antihistamines they're available and a lot of times we use nasals we use nasal sprays that are any histamine sprays or nasal sprays that are cortisone sprays and these are often helpful and sometimes kicking faster with the antihistamine sprays and the cortisone sprays just calm things down in general now there's also a pill that's a leukotriene antagonist that's used that's a prescription that's also very good for allergies what if you don't want to take pills or they're not working where do you go then well that's where allergy shots come into play er allergy immunotherapy where logistically you get a shot of what you're allergic to and a small dose you form allergy antibodies that are blocked because of it they actually form protective antibodies and over time you get protection rather than allergy and so you really sort of solve the problem I'm dr. Robert HS I'm a board-certified allergist at cedars-sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles and I discussed with you today how to fight allergies that cause an itchy nose thank you",

        "video_title": "Vascular Dementia: Causes & Prevention",
        "video_sub_title": "dementia is a general term for any brain disease that cause us a long-term and often gradual decrease in mental ability dementia is commonly attributed to Alzheimer's disease but recent research suggests there is a new and under-diagnosed type of dementia called vascular dementia vascular dementia or vascular cognitive impairment is a huge and growing problem affecting nearly everyone by the age of 70 vascular dementia is the result of small blood vessels deep within the brain weakening with old age the breaking down of these tiny arteries is called small vessel disease this breaking down of microvasculature is associated with poor blood pressure but aging itself has been shown to weaken these blood vessels there are two major pathological factors that contribute to small vessel disease the first is the loss of an elastic protein called elastin elastin is located within the walls of conducting arteries such as the internal carotid arteries these large arteries stretch in response to each pulse and help maintain a relatively constant blood pressure but as elastin weakens with old age the pressure becomes less regular the second factor is a buildup of a protein called fibrin within the walls of small blood vessels in the brain vibrant is normally involved in the clotting of blood but this substance builds up in the arteries as we age leading to poor blood flow to the white matter deep within the brain let's take a closer look at the relevant anatomy and the specific pathological mechanisms that lead to vascular dementia blood reaches the brain by two major sets of arteries the internal carotid arteries and the vertebral arteries the internal carotid artery is composed of three layers the outermost layer the tunica adventitia the tunica media and the innermost layer the Tunica intima the tunica media is a thick muscular layer made up of smooth muscle cells and elastin filaments elastin as mentioned earlier assists in keeping a relatively constant pressure within the artery despite the pulsating nature of the blood flow after the age of 60 these fibrin filaments become weak and less responsive to pulsation resulting in irregular blood pressure and contributing to the breaking down of the brain's micro vascular systems you you the vertebral arteries merge anterior to the brainstem and form the basilar artery the basilar artery then branches laterally giving rise to the posterior cerebral arteries these arteries form an important anastomosis or connection with the internal carotid this connection is called the Circle of Willis at this connecting point the internal carotid branch upward and laterally becoming the middle cerebral arteries and finally two arteries branch superior lis from the middle cerebral arteries forming the anterior cerebral arteries these are all the primary arterial branches responsible for providing blood flow to the brain within the brain is a complex network of tiny vascular systems all working together to perfuse the deep brain the main artery is responsible for this perfusion are the pol arteries which dive deep into the brain from the superior division of the middle cerebral artery the sub ependymal arteries arising from the lateral ventricles which are branches from the choroidal arteries and finally the lenticular striate arteries which arise from the m1 segment of the middle cerebral arteries each of these groups of micro vessels profuse different sections of the white matter there is a small area of white matter that depends on blood flow from each of these systems this section of overlap is known as the subcortical watershed area since this area relies on all these arteries for blood supply small vessel disease makes it extremely susceptible to ischemia small vessel disease is very common in people over the age of 60 around this time these small vessels can become distended and weakened additionally fibrin a fibrous non globular protein normally involved in the clotting of blood begins to accumulate within the endothelium of these vessels the build-up of fibrin dramatically narrows the lumen obstructing the flow of red blood cells and depriving the white matter tissue of much-needed oxygen this results in ischemia consequently the tissue loses density and develops large white matter lesions slowly over time more small vessels break down causing chronic ischemia and the subsequent spread of more white matter lesions this white matter damage is dramatic enough to be visible on radiographs such as MRI scans this is how vascular cognitive impairment is typically diagnosed within the white matter lesions the neurons become d myelinated leading to a loss of the cognitive ability that is associated with vascular dementia there are currently no known cures for vascular dementia but it has recently been discovered that making simple lifestyle changes may help prevent it there is a large body of evidence suggesting that physical exercise can dramatically reduce the risk of cognitive decline new studies have found that drinking beetroot juice will also dramatically decrease the likelihood of developing vascular cognitive impairment beets are high in nitric oxide which has been shown to improve blood flow and lower blood pressure thus potentially preventing the breakdown of the smaller blood vessels in the brain lastly a new therapeutic strategy is being developed called remote ischemic conditioning this approach strengthens an organ over time such as the brain by inducing brief cycles of non-lethal ischemia its older patients are less willing or less able to exercise this may be a good alternative it works by using a blood pressure cuff to temporarily restrict blood flow to an appendage repeatedly for a few minutes each day which increases blood flow to other areas of the body including the brain the increased blood flow activates a series of natural protective mechanisms so later on when potentially lethal ischemia develops the damage to the tissue is not as severe this device is currently being tested in clinical trials but will be available to patients in the coming years",

        "video_sub_title": "hi my name is virgin Derek and today we'll be discussing about cluster headaches now according to the headache International Society cluster headaches are a rare type of headache it affects around 0.1% of the population in affects males 5-6 times more often than females now although cluster headaches are uncommon they are regarded as excruciating and the worst type of headache you can experience out of the knee 300 different headache diagnoses known to date cluster headaches are the highest recorded pain level they are commonly referred to as suicide headache the pain referred is experience is about severe to extreme nature and has been reported by female sufferers to be worse than the pain of childbirth attacks occur in cluster periods or in cyclical patterns there will often awaken you in the middle of the night or a set times during the day duration of attacks range between 15 to 118 minutes and may occur anywhere from 8 times per day to once every second a belt of attacks known as cluster Paris can last for weeks or several months followed by weeks months or even years of remission which are headache free Paris pain affects one side of the head most commonly around or behind or above the eye and or the temporal region and is usually always on the one side now the common signs and symptoms so those are cluster headaches usually cannot keep still during they are often tried to relieve their pain by pacing around the room walking back and forth or sitting down in a hot shower rocking back and forth and sometimes hitting their head against the wall until their pain stops now they're certain as symptoms can include the followings which are severe pain behind or around the affected side and can radiate around the face head and neck region pain is usually unilaterally which means it's firmly usually on one side you can expense restlessness difficulty breathing redness in the eye watery and teary eye runny or congested nose on the same side where the pain is swirling around that same eye or eyelid drooping of the eyelid sweatin of the forehead and face and even pale or flushing of the face now there are two types of cluster headaches the first type is something called episodic cluster headache now this accounts to roughly 80% of all cluster headaches sufferers will have attacks with bouts of cluster periods which can last weeks or months followed by pain-free periods called remission periods which can lasts two months or years they often occur seasonally in a set times during the year on the other hand chronic cluster headaches accounts to roughly 20% of all cluster headaches now sufferers will have a tax larsson for a year or more with out remission periods some may have pairs of headache free days however the is remission periods lasts less than one month so it is quite chronic and severe in nature let's not discuss what risk factors are forecast ahead the risk factor is firstly men men are five to six times more common to have that moon females another risk factor are smokers sufferers can usually be a heavy smoker or their parents are smokers alcohol is another risk factor significant alcohol consumption kin causes and the age the average age is between 20 to 15 years old however this condition can be developed in all age brackets another risk factor is family history having a family member with cluster headaches may also increase your risk of having cluster headaches so what is the cause of cluster headache recent research has shown that a common cause is due to a sensitized brain stem now the brain stem is located below the brain and is located in the upper three cervical spine of the neck the brain some houses a nerve called the trigeminal survival new twists now this can innovate all the way up into the eye where cluster headaches receive the pain if that nerve or if the brain stem is hypersensitive and overactive it can ease it contributes and create cluster headaches symptoms and cluster headache pain so what we would recommend is that you do seek a professional who deals with chronic headaches and migraines in more importantly cluster headaches if you do suffer from cluster headaches then email us or even call us on 136 is treatable and can be managed quite well my name is Bertrand Dirk and hopefully you have a better understanding of what cluster headaches are thank you",

        "video_title": "Grey and Champagne Natural Smokey Eye Tutorial",
        "video_sub_title": "hi guys its Jamie and Sam to show you how I did this book on my eyes it was kind of like a natural smoky eye look that I do I myself I like it because it's kind of smoky and gray but it's also kind of like bright where my eyes don't look too small there's a lot of light colors and there's really not that many colors involved um so this is kind of like an everyday look our this at night maybe even during the day too but it's a pretty simple natural but you had kind of smoky look so I did a little bit of a pink or cheek and a nude lip to go with it and um yeah so let's get started into the tutorial so the first thing I'm going to do is take my mac 227 brush which looks like this and naked lunch which is this pretty frosted neutral pink color and I'm just going to get that all over my brush like this and just Pat it onto my lid and going a little bit into the crease and making sure i really get it in this corner here so once you have all that patted on I'm going to take a pencil brush looks like this and I'm going to take the same color The Naked Lunch dab this in and take it underneath my eye just like this on the lower lash line this will really help reflect light and make your eyes look a lot bigger and then I'm going to make sure I get it up in here really well to on this cold on this inner corner and I'm going to take another pencil brush this is also by Mac it was just a little special edition one and I like this one because it's a lot more rounded than this one I use this on my other eye dats why it's dirty but it's a lot more rounded this one's a lot more pointed so I'm going to take this pencil brush into my scene eyeshadow which looks like this it's kind of like a bluish purplish grade so I'm just going to take my brush into it like that tap off any excess and then I'm going to take this on the outer part of my lower lash line and I'm going to bring it up towards my eyebrow just kind of drawing a line and slowly working this a little bit at a time it's ok if this line looks a little bit weird we're going to blend that end now we're just going to take this color down and I don't have a lot of space like in between my eyebrow in my lid especially when my eyes are open just like that so you may need to just adjust how you do this a little bit like you may not need to take it up kind of like I am but I want to create that shape so now I'm just going to take this down once I have that little wing I'm just going to take this Stila brush it's the number 30 and I like this end of it and I'm just going to dip a little bit of this into the scene then I'm just going to work and blending this into the outer corner of my eye and into my crease a little bit once you're done blending you should have something that kind of looks a little bit like this just kind of smoky but kind of neutral so now I'm just going to take the blending one step further and I'm going to take a matte color called kid by Mac and it looks like this and I'm just going to dip a 217 brush into the tip of this and then I'm going to take it over this just to kind of blend everything in into my crease and up to my brow bone just so there's no real harsh lines or anything so now I'll just do deep in this outer color just a tiny bit more I'm going to take print by Mac which is kind of like a darker gray color get it on it same fluffier brush just drag those along the very outer corner of my lash line and then on to my upper lash line so now I'm going to line my eye with the Makeup Forever aqua eyes and it's the gray color I got this in a little set I guess it's the color 21l but it really doesn't have a color name maybe because I got this one like a little set but i'm just going to use this pencil to line my upper lash line and my upper tight line and I start at the middle of my lashline work my way out I like to wing it up a little bit and draw it into just right around here so once you have a nice line kind of drawn like that just a little bit of a wing I'm going to take my trish mcevoy precision eyeliner brush which looks like this and I'm going to dip it into some print eyeshadow by mac and i'm just going to tap this on the top to seal in my eyeliner and to fill in any little spaces that I may have missed along my lash line you can also take this under your lash line here if you want some added definition okay so then we have that now I'm going to take the same eyeliner I used for up here and just do my tight line just by looking up and ever so lightly lining the top of that i'm going to be doing my bottom waterline and a little bit of the Makeup Forever aqua eyes and this champagne color which is 23 l and it's a lot similar to the mac Naked Lunch and it looks really pretty with this kind of gray color and I like to keep my bottom waterline kind of light so that my eyes look awake and open I tend to feel like they look too small if i use to dark of a color my eyes look too small so i'm going to use this and just tell my head down and line my bottom waterline and then i'm just going to take a little bit of this and draw it on to a inner bottom lash line just for some added shine now i'm just going to curl my lashes and put on some mascara and then i'll tell you how I finish this look so for cheeks i kinda did a lot i use the man cream base and so sweet and so easy just because I thought a bright pink kind of against the Grays in this kind of neutral I like it would be nice to have like a path of pink so I use this cream base and then over it I used the mat well dressed blush which is this one right here so pretty light pink and then just for kind of a contour I use the personal style beauty powder brush that came out with the all ages all races all sexes line by mac it looks like this it's just like a really a neutral color and then for my lips I used chrome danube by mac and this YSL lip gloss and golden glass it looks like this so that's it i hope you guys enjoyed this pretty simple smokey eye tutorial and I was hot job very soon",

        "video_sub_title": "Adult BLS CPR. In this video, we will be showing you the techniques and sequence of adult CPR. 1. Always make sure the scene is safe for you and the victim. 2. Check for response by tapping the victim's shoulder and shout, \"Are you okay?\" 3. If there is no response, that is, if the victim is unresponsive and not breathing, or only gasping, then activate emergency system and get or call for AED. 4. Check for the carotid pulse for at least 5 seconds but no more than 10 seconds. 5. If you do not feel the pulse, then start CPR immediately, starting with chest compressions. Remember, start compressions within 10 seconds of recognition of cardiac arrest. Push hard and fast, at a rate of at least 100 compressions per minute. Count out loud \"1, 2, 3, 4, 5\" up to 30 compressions. 6. After 30 compressions, open the airway using the head tilt/chin lift method. Give two breaths. Deliver air over one second to make the victim's chest rise. 7. Give one breath every 5 to 6 seconds for a rate of 10-12 breaths per minute. 8. Continue 30 compressions followed by 2 ventilations, that is a ratio of 30:2, until an advanced airway, endotracheal tube, combitube, or laryngeal mask airway is placed. 9. Once the advanced airway is placed, then start continuous chest compressions with ventilations, at a rate of one breath every 6-8 seconds, or a rate of 8-10 ventilations per minute. 10. AED should be used as soon as it is available. Resume chest compressions immediately after the shock is given. Remember, for adult CPR the ratio of compression to ventilation is 30:2 for both one and two rescuers. For two rescuers, change the compressor every two minutes or every 5 cycles to avoid fatigue. Rescuers should try to change the compressor role in less than 5 seconds.",

This adult either was choking, conscious and went unconscious, either we witnessed it or bystanders witnessed it or through our assessment, they had a pulse but were not breathing and we tried to give a rescue breath and it wouldn't go in, even after repositioning the head. Any way we find this person when we don't have an open airway and we can't get air in, we're going to treat the as if they're an unresponsive choking patient. So our gloves are on, our rescue mask is available and our scene is safe. I'm still going to make sure that the patient is not breathing normally and we assess the patient for movement. And there isn't any. Whether they are going from conscious to unconscious or we find them unresponsive, if EMS or a code has not been called yet, it's at this point that we need to make sure EMS is called. So you in the plaid shirt, go call 911 and come back. If you can find an AED, bring it with you. Or, call a code. At this point in time, I am going to go ahead and give my 30 chest compressions. One and two and three and four and five and six and seven and eight, nine and ten. 11 and 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30. Now make note that these chest compressions are just like CPR. They are 2 to 2.4 inches deep and they're at a rate of between 100 and 120 times a minute. And we're still giving those chest compressions right on the sternum on the lower third of the sternum. Now something to keep in mind if this person was pregnant, if they were a female who is pregnant, we would still do these chest compressions and it would basically stay away from the baby in the womb so we wouldn't have any complications. So that question gets asked from time to time and I just wanted to make that clarification. We do the chest compressions the same exact way whether it's a non pregnant or a pregnant patient. Now, I go from there to a head tilt chin lift. I look in the mouth. Did any product come out with my compressions? If I don't see it, I'm not doing a blind finger sweep. If I do see it, I'm going to sweep it out. In this case I do not see anything but I'm going to try two breaths. I try my first breath. It doesn't go in. So I reposition the head down and back up again. I try a second breath but it doesn't go in. So I go right back to my chest compressions and do 30 more chest compressions. After the 30 compressions I go back into the mouth. I look. If I see an object, I'm going to sweep it out and I'm going to try a rescue breath. This time the rescue breath went in. So I give another one. It went in again. So now as a healthcare provider, I'm going to check for a carotid pulse for no more than ten seconds. If the pulse is present but there's no breathing normally, I'm going to continue rescue breathing at a rate of one breath every five seconds for two minutes. After two minutes I'm going to reassess a pulse, check for normal breathing, check for a carotid pulse. If the pulse is still there, I'm going to continue rescue breathing. If the pulse is gone, I'm going to go straight into full CPR and continue my 30 compressions with two rescue breaths until EMS arrives, an AED arrives or my patient revives.",

        "video_title": "AC Joint Sprain Rehabilitation - Stretches, Exercises and Massage For Faster Recovery",
        "video_sub_title": "hello and welcome to uk fitness hub my name is travis taran and in today's video we're going to be covering the ac joint we're going to be going through where it is what it does and also what to do to re-strengthen the joint up after injury let's get into it [Music] so let's get straight into it so when we're talking about the ac joint we're talking about the acromioclavicular joint and it gets its name from two bones of the body the clavicle which is just here also are more commonly referred to as the collar bone and the acromion process of the scapular which is just here so if we take a look at that the scapula is what we commonly refer to as our shoulder blade and this frontal extension that wraps around and comes around to here that's the acromion process so the clavicle attaches to the acromion process by way of the acromioclavicular ligament so let's look at the word sprain so if we've done an acromioclavicular sprain that just means the over stretching or the tear of that chromioclavicular ligament the acromioclavicular ligament attaches the clavicle and the acromion together it allows for stability of the joint and if we've got a tear they're put into grades so grades of severity grade one would be a mild tear all the way through to a higher grade tear which could be a full rupture so the complete tear of the ligament itself when we're looking at ligaments they're just connective tissues so they're strong fibrous bands of tissue that allow the joint to be able to have free function and movement and to be able to support stress on the joint there's two main reasons for ac joints brains the first one is overuse so overuse can be somebody that does a job that constantly requires the shoulder joint to be working so let's take somebody doing hedge trimming all day constantly holding up a heavy tool above the head that kind of thing and then there's trauma so trauma can be something as extreme as a car crash and something as simple as somebody falling over with an extended arm full separations and full tears of the ac joint ligament and the ac joint itself can happen due to excessive extreme force so this could be for example somebody going in for a rugby tackle where all the force is on the ac joint so that's a quite a common actual reason for somebody completely tearing the ligament itself so let's get into some of the symptoms the first one is a limited range of movement and weakness in the surrounding muscles so that's number one one of the first things that people will get tend to be inflammation and swelling redness and soreness when this happens inflammation is actually quite a good thing inflammation is clearing the sight of debris speeding up and starting the healing process so don't be afraid of inflammation it's actually quite good for the body so what are we going to do in today's video so in today's video i want you to get past the point of inflammation so be at the point where the shoulder doesn't hurt anymore it might feel weak or have a limited range of movement but it's past the point of pain i'm going to start off with some of the most simple exercises to mobilize the shoulder we're going to go through a massage technique and then strengthening techniques for the shoulder joint itself let's get into them the first step in rehabilitation after the ligament is healed is to do pendulum swings i'm using a chair here for balance but you can use the side of a table or lean onto a wall start off by completely relaxing your arm then begin to rock your body backwards and forwards in a split stance the rocking motion of your body should start to swing your arm backwards and forwards gradually increase the speed and range of motion and do this for 45 seconds twice over if you find you're pushing through pain you'll be an indication that you're not quite ready in the healing process for this exercise the next mobilization is circular swings i start in a very similar position to the last exercise the main difference however is my foot position i'm more square onto the chair now rather than in a split stance begin to rock your body in a circular motion with a relaxed arm you're trying to get the arm to complete a circle do this for 25 seconds then repeat in the opposite direction so if you used to do clockwise for the first 25 seconds you would go anti-clockwise for the second 25 seconds remember the arm throughout the entirety of this exercise is completely relaxed as if i had a dead arm it's my body that's allowing my shoulder to do this movement complete two sets in total of 50 seconds next we're going to apply a friction massage technique start off with two fingers underneath the ac joint at the top of the shoulder muscle and gently apply pressure up along the ac joint the purpose of friction massage is to maintain the mobility within the ligament and soften scar tissue start off with two minutes of gentle massage if you massage for too long or with too much pressure the area can get sore now we're going to work the joint through flexion with a stability ball you can do this without a ball on a table or work surface but i find the ball adds an extra dimension of benefits to this exercise start off on your knees with the sides of your hands in contact with the stability ball then begin to move the ball away from you with straight arms until your head is between your biceps slowly roll the ball back to the start position and repeat this for 15 repetitions three sets over now we're going to start to strengthen up the joint and surrounding muscles with a series of isometric exercises isometric simply means creating a muscular contraction without movement in this case i'm doing a shoulder external rotation i have my hand against a fixed object and resistance and i'm pushing into the object away from my body as i do this i can feel my shoulder muscles contract however because i'm pushing into a fixed resistance there's no movement remember to keep your elbow tucked into your side at all times and hold for 15 seconds for three sets over with all these isometrics make sure that you push to a seven or a six out of ten next we have internal rotation again i'm using a fixed resistance and this time i'm trying to push towards the midline of my body i keep my elbow tucked in closely to my side and hold the contraction again for 15 seconds repeating for three sets there are two further planes of motion that need to be worked isometrically next up is extension i start off in front of the fixed resistance object and place my arm behind my body a good way to remember this position and extension is think of it as being in the same position as passing a baton to somebody in a relay race you put your arm in extension to pass the baton behind you again i push my arm back holding the contraction for 15 seconds before repeating two further times to make three sets we have shoulder flexion which is the opposite of shoulder extension this time i'm trying to contract the shoulder in a forwards motion all of these isometrics work the shoulder in different planes of motion so they work different parts of the shoulder and different muscles isometrics are great for ligaments to be strengthened in the safest way possible as the joint doesn't move failure to re-strengthen post-injury can cause a reoccurrence of the same injury finally we have band puller parts you can do these seated or standing i'm using a thera-band here and you can buy these in different strengths to suit where you're at in your rehabilitation begin to slowly pull the band apart keeping your wrist straight and your elbows tucked in and return back to the start position slowly as you get tired you may find your range of motion decreases and that's perfectly fine make sure that throughout the whole exercise you're keeping those elbows tucked in make sure that you don't cheat by bringing them out as well as the hands this exercise targets the infraspinatus which provides stability and mobility to the shoulder joint aim to work up to 15 repetitions for three sets that concludes all the stretches exercises and techniques i just want to finish off by saying if you get to the stage where your shoulders feeling good you're regaining the strength through the isometrics we covered and also those band pull aparts if you get to the stage where you're feeling great and you want to go back to the gym and do shoulder presses and do certain dynamic movements take it easy the muscles are going to feel good to go but the ligament takes a little bit of time just to remodel and get back into movement patterns so make sure that you're properly warming up the shoulder joint i've got a full workout shoulder joint video on how to warm it up i'll put it at the end roll of this video so make sure to check that out if you're a bit lost of how to warm up the shoulder before an exercise workout otherwise enjoy the rest of your day subscribe for more free educational content and like the video if you learned something new you've been watching uk fitness hub i've been travis taran and i'll see you soon [Music] you",

        "video_title": "1940's / 50's Pinup Hair and Makeup",
        "video_sub_title": "- [Kayley] Hey everyone, Kayley here with this 1940s slash '50s pin-up rockabilly hair and makeup tutorial. I've gotten so many requests for this over the years so let's go ahead and get started with the makeup. First of all, we're going to start out with highlighter because highlight and very dewy glowy looking skin is very important to a good pin-up or rockabilly look. So I'm using this Girl Meets Pearl highlighter and I'm patting it into the tops of my cheeks and you can see that it gives me a really nice healthy natural luminous looking glow. And then I'm using this cream eyeshadow on the inner corners and underneath my eyebrows. Now shimmer isn't exactly accurate to the 1940s and '50s. But it does really provide a really great glowy healthy skin look which I think is very important. Then next step is to contour. It's very important to any pin-up look. And we're going to be taking this Hoola bronzer and I'm just taking it through the hollows of my cheeks and really building it up so that you get a more drastic contour than you would wear on a normal basis. And then we're going to move onto blush. And we want a really rosy cheeked application so for that I'm taking Dandelion blush and I'm just going to pat it over the apples of my cheeks and then slightly blend it back just so it doesn't look crazy. You don't want little circles on your cheeks. But you do want it built up mostly towards the apples of your cheeks just to get that really rosy healthy glow. And now we're moving onto eyeshadow. I'm going to use the Most Glamorous Neutrals Ever palette. And I'm mixing these top two colors because I want to create a color that's very close to my skin tone so I'm just putting that over my lid. And then I'm going to move onto my highlight color which is going to go in my tear duct and underneath my eyebrow where we already placed that shimmery eyeshadow base. Then once that's done we're gonna create a really great crease. The first thing that we're gonna do to create that is to take this dark brown color and then take a very fluffy crease blending brush and basically that is going to create a really diffused application. So it's going to look very light, much lighter than the color actually. You get kind of a nice diffused airbrush look from it. Then you're going to take a more focused kind of pencil brush and focus that right at the base of the crease. You can see this application is much darker so you get a really great gradient from this really dark application at the bottom fading really nicely up to the highlight at the top which is very important. Now we're moving onto winged eyeliner. Now this one can be tough and I do have a tutorial if you want to check that out. First you want to create a line that extends at the same angle as your lower eyelid. And you're going to connect that back to the middle of your upper eyelid. And then basically just line in a very thin line around the rest of your eyelid just to create a kind of flow to the rest of the eyeliner. Once you like how the outline looks just fill it in and you have your winged eyeliner. Again, I have another tutorial if that was really really fast, 'cause it was. And now we're moving onto eyebrows. To get a really great defined brow, I took the wax from Brow Zings and took that under the bottom of my eyebrow to create a really nice edge. And then I moved to the pattern to fill everything else. 'Cause that way it doesn't look like Sharpie eyebrows but you still get a lot of definition. But if it still looks a little too drastic to you, you can always take a spooly and kind of diffuse it a little bit so it doesn't look too drastic. And the next thing that you want are definitely flirty eyelashes so I used some BadGal mascara and some false eyelashes to create a really great flirty look. And finally I'm going to finish off with luscious lips. Now if you're going to be wearing this to a party, I really recommend going ahead and staining your lips with Benetint first or any lip stain that you like to create a nice bit of color on your lips. That way once your lipstick wears off, you still have some color there. Speaking of lipstick, I'm using this Hydracolor in Dare Me and it's a beautiful hydrating lipstick that creates that really nice luscious look and hydrates your lips from the stain that we just used so that your lips look beautiful all night long. And that's it for the makeup. And now we're going to move onto hair. Now this is actually not as hard as it might seem. We're gonna start out by sectioning and curling the hair for the victory rolls. So you're gonna go head and part your hair on whatever side you prefer but it does probably need to be a side part so this doesn't look silly. And then you're gonna ahead and part about three inches of hair from your hairline all the way down to your ear. And everything else from that back if you want to go ahead and separate. Do the same thing on the other side and clip the hair that it's in the back out of the way. Then we're gonna curl the hair that's in the front. You want to curl it straight back away from your face. And once you're done curling it, you want to go ahead and put it back in its curled shape and pin it in place. And then if you have any especially wide areas, go ahead and split them in half just to make sure that you're not curling too much hair at once and continue doing that until that entire section is curled. Then go ahead and repeat the exact same thing on the other side until your hair is curled and placed. Now we're gonna go ahead and curl the remaining hair. To do this we're starting in sections, starting at the bottom. So you want to go ahead and section your hair, leaving about two inches down at the bottom, clip the rest up. Now you're going to curl the hair in little square sections going in one direction and I'm doing this toward the right. And then clipping them back up once they've been curled. Once you've got that first layer curled, you're gonna go ahead and drop another layer that's exactly the same width, clip the rest of the hair up, and curl everything the exact same way again. The only thing that's really important here is that you're taking the exact same size sections and you're curling them in the exact same way. That way they all form together into great waves. But you can do this with rectangles if you want to so you don't have to do as many curls because that would take less time if you want to. And I do I have another tutorial on that if you want to check it out. Once those curls are completely cool you can go ahead and let them down and if you want to you can spray as you go to make sure that they stay really well like I did just there. And now we're going to move on to the scary stuff. Which is to comb out the curls. I'm using a boar bristle brush to comb through my hair. And I use the 3/4 inch iron before because my hair loses its curl pretty easily. So if your hair tends to be like that, go with the smaller iron. You can see that doing this creates some frizz, some kind of undesirable frizz which is actually very accurate to the 1940s but not desirable in the 21st century. So here's what you can do to fix it. I took a little bit of shine spray from Sexy Hair put it on my hand, wiped it between two hands and ran it over my hair and look what happened. The frizz went away. And the more you use, the more sleek and smooth it will look. But you can see there's a big difference between the two sides. So you can do this with a lot of different products and I'll probably make a video on it but just in case you guys need it now that's what you can do to help fight the frizz. Now let's move onto the victory rolls. Once those curls are completely cool, go ahead and let them down and then tease. The teasing is going to give you that nice shape. To get that nice kind of roll shape, you do need both the curl and the teasing to hold it in place. So once you got a tease, go ahead and smooth over the top so it doesn't look frizzy from the front. And then wrap your hair around two fingers and you're going to create a little doughnut shape. Which you can see right here. Now you're gonna take that doughnut and roll it up like a sleeping bag until it's right against your head. You can see I'm doing that very nice and slowly and meticulously. And then you let the back of that teasing just fall behind the little doughnut. And it creates a victory roll. That's basically all it takes. And then I went ahead and after that was all placed the way I wanted it, stuck a bobby pin or two through the middle of it. And basically because you got all that hair going on you don't have to worry about how you pin it, just crisscross them to make sure that they hold really really well. And then you're gonna repeat the same thing on the other side. Give it that teasing to give it the support it needs to stand up, smooth it so that it doesn't look frizzy. Then you're going to create your doughnut by wrapping around two fingers just like so and then you're just gonna roll that doughnut up like a sleeping bag until it's right against your head. And pin it in place. And that's it for the hairstyle. I hope you guys like this and if you try it out, definitely send me pictures, I love seeing them. And also make sure to check out my previous Halloween tutorials, I've been loving them, and you guys have been loving them. So you should just check them out if you haven't. And that's it, I'll see you guys in my next video, muah, bye.",

        "video_title": "Homemade Refreshing Setting Spray Pt 1",
        "video_sub_title": "hey everyone welcome to encore and welcome to my kitchen because today we are going to make a homemade refresher spray welcome back sue I know that many of you guys have been waiting for this video forever and a day and I have been trying to formulate it perfectly for months and months and months actually over a year and the problem have been running into is that the mixture basically spoils after a few days and wanted to be able to mix a refresher spray that's going to last more than a few days so I've tried many different you know combination of ingredients and the first time I did it it's both in three days and then I tried something else ten days still not long enough and I wanted it to at least last four weeks and now I finally got it to about six weeks which i think is acceptable enough considering the fact that I'm not putting any parabens in it or preserves you know preservatives so which is good because that's what I wanted to basically come up with is a preservative free refreshing spray now many of you guys have been inquiring as well as to what's the difference between a refresher spray and a setting spray basically a refresher sprays just something that you know kind of like boost up your look you know just to refresh your face or something like that now you're refreshing setting spray is basically something that you spritz over your makeup so that all the powders set basically what happens like if you use powder or a mostly powder for your makeup they're actually like spherical they're like little microbeads alright that's just surface of your skin now in order for that to set you're going to need a misting setting spray that's going to enable those fears to basically kind of melt into the skin otherwise it's just on the surface of your skin and their spherical and basically they're going to basically you know just slide off your skin and that's one of the main reason why you're going to need to touch up throughout the course of the day so a refresher spray is going to enable the makeup to set on your skin so just kind of like melts the sphere so that way at least nice and flat and sticking to your skin so today we're going to basically do the mixture for you guys in this video so that way you can do this at home as well now the ingredients once you calculate and add it all up it's going to actually cost more than you know a regular bottle of refresher spray that you buy out in the market but if you use them a lot like I do oh my gosh I use them so much sometimes it's going to save you money as well so basically that's also one of the purpose I want to do this video is for those of you guys who use them as much as I do to say below money but the ingredients basically you know once you have gathered the ingredients you can gosh make gallons and gallons and gallons of these of this refreshing spray so let's start with the ingredients very important we're gonna start with water and distilled water is best now this is distilled water that I got from my local drugstore chain and right now they're on special for 99 cents for a gallon and that's definitely cheaper than a gallon of purified water now I do not recommend for you guys to use tap water because tap water is high in calcium and sodium and you don't want that in your skin so definitely look into distilled water of course we're going to use a glycerin and I bought a new bottle again I got this at Rite Aid right there and just ask your pharmacist where you know on what aisle you can find glycerin ok we're going to use teabag and this is green tea because I wanted a green tea base and for those of you guys almost wandering this is also what's going to add caffeine to your refreshing spray see it gives you that nice you know fresh waking up look alright it's going to wake up the skin alright and of course green tea is very very good for the skin now I'm also going to add cucumber cucumber extract is really really good for the skin again it takes care of redness if you have rosacea it's going to just kind of calm it down a little bit if you have darkening in the skin that's also going to take care of that all right I'm going to use fresh cucumber in just a medium size just like this is fine and then there are two oils that's very very important that you need to get and this is what really kind of like make-it-or-break-it for this mixture the first one is tea tree oil ok tea tree oil is probably one of the most powerful antibacterial antiseptic antifungal oils out in the market alright and this is of course great for the hair and the skin and the other oil is rose oil okay again antibacterial and antiseptic great for the skin it's actually extracted from real roses okay and it's actually the combination of these two is is going to make your refreshing spray last long without parabens and other preservatives okay so these two are very very important now as far as rose water you can buy rose water from your local drugstore much like this one I got this at CBS alright it's usually going to say artificial but it's actually it's the process they make these basically they use rose oil and then they mix it with water making it hard to fishel but the rose oil is actually natural so the only reason why they put artificial is because it's not actual rose water that they extract it's the oil in that they mix it with water so that's what makes the rose water you can use this as well that I can highly highly recommend rose oil together okay so tea tree oil and rose oil now what I'm going to do is take this further because I want my refresher spray to be multi-purpose multi-use I want to be able to spray it on hair I want to be able to make it kind of like an aftershave like whether you're shaving facial hair for those of you guys or ladies if you're shaving your legs I want to be able to use the spray as well as a soothing spray aftershave so I'm going to add a few more oils and oils by the way you can buy this at like natural kind of ingredients store Coastal Scents carries all kinds of carrier oils and essential oils and this one's rosemary I'm going to add rosemary to my mixture because it's one of the best natural hair tonic so I'm going to be able to spray this on the hair with no problem of course rosemary is good for the skin as well alright and I'm also going to add sage alright sage is really good for the skin and lavender of course everybody who likes our Roma therapy you know what lavender does so when you spray this on your skin and you can smell the lavender it suits you would calm see the answers got a calming effect and definitely that's going to be beneficial to this spray I'm also going to add lemon alright because I'm using natural organic vegetables like cucumber and I'm going to use the lemon oil so that the you know the cucumber extract it's not going to spoil quickly because the rest of the ingredients might last a long time but you know some of the kind of like vegetable ingredients probably going to spawn sooner so the lemon oil is going to help extend the life of that ingredient okay so let's begin",

        "video_sub_title": "so the motor is going to go right behind this panel here and to get take that panel off we're going to have to take out the rear seats and take out the rear seats well oh definitely take out some bolts in order to take out the rear seats you have to remove this piece right here that covers the back the tools to do that just pop the back seats down we have to remove this piece right here and it just held on by clips see that and there you go so now just remove the entire assembly the cart first thing to do when taking out the back seats let's take out these bolts right there on the outside there's the other one on the other side let's take those two out so you see we got those bolts out so now we need to pull out a few from the front to put the seats back up so we can get access to those so they're under these panels covers here here and here pull these panels just grab it let's gently tug it will come off and you'll expose a new bolt let's do that to all three of them careful we'll be gentle they have clips on the bottom here so with these ones here the probably the same size is the first one yep which is amusing quo using a 14 millimeter you can't quite see that 14 millimeter so take those three bolts off now after you have these three bolts removed the seat should rock back and forth freely it's all one unit this is one of two places where you're going to need someone else's help to remove something from the car the other one probably being this side door itself so find a friend and get these seats out the next thing we have to do is remove the seat belt bolt it holds the seat belt on we have to remove both bolts this one and the next one of the next one's a bit more complicated we'll have to move that side panel but let's start with this one right here with that bolt removing just let it hang let's take a look at taking this panel off here for the second seatbelt you'll see that it goes right behind this panel panel here runs the entire length up to here to get this panel off you just want to start right here get your finger under there and just slowly pry it up and screamy gentle with it and it comes right off and then you can see this bolts a little bit hidden under there so you're using that same was it a 14 millimeter socket put that bolt out after you undo that bolt just let it hang then we're gonna have to take off these covers here let's do that first so just grab your flat screwdriver fit it underneath there slightly pry it off oh and there's nothing behind this one let's try door number two this one off and there is a screw in there and you just can't see it from this camera deep inside so remove those screws so much remove that screw put it aside I had to fish it out with the screwdriver it was really deep in there and the next one you want to take out is this Phillips screw here I've already unscrewed it let's pull it out and then this 12-volt connector so I can give you a better view of it right there you can see that so I'm going to press down on the top and pull it out and let it hang just take it off you get this back panel off you'll notice that overlaps with this panel here so taking out the first clip we're going to go to the other clip on the other side to remove this entire panel let's try get your fingers in there again just pop it up to remove this panel instead get your fingers under here tuck pretty hard that clip is in there really well zoom inside hook it out to get this piece out just your fingers under here I get off in this point along these letters start on the side on this part put some force but still being gentle pry it off put that side so now you can see a new clip closed and then next we're going to look at see if we take better image there that little cover right there which folds down this latch shut down I'll pull this one out let's even get a better view of this just get your fingers and put them behind there now open up and expose another bolt so undo undo that bolt by this point you should be feeling pretty this you can start tugging it from the bottom fingers under there just give it a nice little pulls a few at the bottom out put your fingers along up and release these and then then for this part you have to pull away from the door there you go the reason for that is these clips look like that the next thing that you'll have to do that I jumped ahead and did is remove the panel that went right here and this is maybe a good thing that will help you understand how it was connected so there's the this panel is mounted by a screw on this side and right there as well actually wrong mountain with a screw and then has little plastic Clips like I showed you earlier and mounted here in here so for pieces that are holding that panel in just to show you the panel look like it was like this so you had those long screws on both sides which protruded for looking back at the panel here one right there and then the second one was a little harder to see but it was right there so that's what the grommet hole used to be and that's where the scoop came through and they're easy to spot because they stick it out a lot just having to pry a little bit to get those plastic connectors out",

        "video_title": "Learn How to Make Machine Sewn Wefts Tutorial - DoctoredLocks.com",
        "video_sub_title": "To create wefted hair, there's a few things that you'll need. You'll need hair, scissors, two inch masking tape, nail glue, the liquid kind, not the gel kind, card stock, which can be a postcard or a manilla folder, comb, extra-hold hairspray, a flat iron or a regular household iron, a sewing machine and thread that corresponds to your hair color. Let's take a look at setting up your machine. If you're going to be creating wefts on a regular basis, you may want to consider investing in a double or a triple needle. A single needle requires four passes over the   extension hair to create a single weft, whereas a double only requires two passes and a triple needle only requires one. So it can cut down on the amount of work required significantly. There are different machine settings that are associated with each needle. Your machine settings for a single and a double   needle are going to be the same. You want to make sure that your stitch selector is set to 'Zigzag,' that your stitch tension is between eight and nine, that your stitch width is about a two, and that your stitch length is about a .5 . For a triple needle, the settings are a little bit different. You are going to make sure that you are on straight stitch only, so that's usually a setting number one. Your tension is going to be somewhere between seven and nine, your stitch width won't matter because it's a straight stitch, and your stitch length should still be the same at .5 . For your single needle, you'll thread your machine just like normal. For your double and your triples, you'll wind extra bobbins and you'll use those to thread your machine. Now let's take a look at the hair. To keep our hair orderly, we're using masking tape. We're going to be placing this sticky side up, folding the ends under so they grip the table. We're placing two strips side-by-side, with a tiny gap in the middle. The next step is to spread the hair. Because this is human hair, we're not going to be folding   it in half.  We're only going to be doing a slight fold from the top. Take care to spread your hair evenly because this will be your entire weft's thickness. The next step is to make the hair stiffer so that it's easier to work with. So we're just going to saturate it with hairspray. If your hair moves at all, you can use a comb and push it back into place. Be sure to let your hair dry thoroughly and then   you're ready to apply your top tape.  You can use thinner tape in a pinch, but the two   inch tape helps hold the most amount of hair possible while you're doing the stitches. Press these together so that they're tight. The next step is to cut your edges. And now you're ready to begin your sewing. Load the hair into your machine. I'm using a single needle, so I'll be doing a four pass stitch. Once you reach the end, you're ready to flip and do another pass. And reload it into the machine. Trying to stay right above my previous stitch. Holding the tail and begin sewing. Once we've flipped and done our second stitch, this completes our first pass. Because we've used a single needle, we'll need to repeat this three more times. If you've chosen to use a double needle, you'll repeat it one more time, and if you've used a triple needle you're done. So, let's keep moving.  We have three more times. With your binding stitching in place, now it's time to create the fold. So you're going to place your cardstock in between your pieces of masking tape and use a flat iron or an iron to press that flat. Press the seam until your weft is nice and flat. Next you're ready to do your top stitching to hold that in place.  So, we're just   going to load that back into the machine. And do a couple passes. With your stitches complete, it's now time to remove your masking tape. The next step is to apply your nail glue to secure your ends. So we're just going to add a drop of glue. Wait til that dries and then cut away your tails. Here you have your completed weft, ready for installation.",

        "video_sub_title": "\u266a Bob and Brad \u266a \u266a The two most famous physical therapists \u266a \u266a on the internet \u266a - Hi folks, I'm Bob Schrupp, Physical Therapist. - Brad Heineck, Physical Therapist. - And we're the most famous physical therapists on the internet. - In our opinion, of course, Bob. - Today we're going to show you how to stop hip bursitis pain without seeing a doctor or having an injection! - Right. - We're certainly going to give you some advice here on things to try before you go that far. By the way, if you're new to our channel, please take a second to subscribe to us. We provide videos on how to stay healthy, fit, pain-free, and we upload every day. Also, join us on our website bobandbrad.com because right now, once again, we're giving away a huge product this week. We're giving away the Teeter Inversion Table. - Right. - This is really a cool table that you can use for decompression. And Brad and I are just amazed; it's made by a guy named Teeter. - Right! - Now what are the odds that, you know, it teeter-totters! - Roger Teeter. - Yeah how is it that he come up with it, to have that name and to come up with that product? By the way, also you can find us on Facebook. BobandBrad. Want a short version of us? A 60 second version, go to Instagram or Twitter. We do it every day. - There you go. - We never stop. We're like a hurricane, I don't know. Or like a Juggernaut? - [Brad] You're babbling, Bob. Now they're gonna holler at us. - Alright. - Okay, Bob, this is why I wanted to do this. Two reasons. We did a nice video on this six years ago. I looked at it; it's a little burlar-y. There was some information that we can add to. That's one reason. The other reason is I was doing some research on it, and almost all the research I could find was talking about injections and all this invasive, aggressive treatment you need to go to the doctor for. And I really think that if you approach it properly you can avoid all that and get rid of it. Because bursitis can be real debilitating, you know? It limits your walking, hip pain, et cetera. But if you understand it-- - It can affect your sleeping. - Oh right! We're gonna show you why it happens. There's something called an IT band that comes down here, and you have some other connective tissue that goes over the greater trochanter, this is part of the hip. And what happens is when you walk and you move, the tissues slide back and forth over that bone. Now if there was no bursa there, a bursa sac, that would become very painful, and things would wear out very quickly. So what we have is a bursa sac which is represented by my little piece of paper here to allow it to slide back and forth real easily. If this bursa sac becomes inflamed and irritated, that's where the pain is. That's the source of pain right there, so we need to get the pressure off of there, allow it to calm down, heal, and get back to life. - Yeah, and the thought process is, Brad, we believe that if you have what we call a Trendelenburg, like you're kinda walking with your hips waddling back and forth, that's putting the increased stress on that bursa also. - Right. - So we want to, at some point, strengthen things. Or, should I jump to this one, Brad? - Well, go ahead, Bob! - Actually if you use a cane right now, that can stop that waddling from occurring, and that can also stop some of the stress on the bursae. - Right. - So quite often what you would do if you have bursitis just in one hip, let's say we have it on my left side, you're gonna use the cane on the right side. - Sure. - We won't go into the mechanics of that. There's a whole physics behind it, right? - But it's true; it takes pressure off the opposite hip. - So when you're moving the left foot forward, you're moving the right cane forward at the same time, and that will help straighten things out, and it'll definitely take some of the stress off. And a lot of times, if you can calm things down, it stays calmed down. I'm amazed at how quite often just a cane can make a big difference. - Yeah, we do this with our patients. - All the time. - Have them use a cane. The pain was at a six before, now it dropped down to a three just with the use of a cane as a temporary thing. - Yep. _ It's not like you're going to use it for the rest of your life. - That's right, we're not saying that you're bound to it. - Right. That's one of the options you can do. Now we're gonna give four options, and then some exercises. The second one is simply, if it's irritated and sore, get yourself a cold pack. I brought mine out like this, but Bob says, \"You gotta have a bigger one than that!\" - Come on, what is this? - Well the bursa's not that big. - For a girly man-- - You could use one like that. But yeah, if you got a big one, get like this. You know? And you can lay on your side. This I'll make my sore hip. You could do this in a recliner but you need to get that cold pack directly on your hip. But make sure you have some layer of clothing. I just had a patient yesterday, he got burned from a cold pack. - [Bob] He did? - Yeah, he didn't have the layer of clothing. So you've gotta be careful. Twenty minutes. - [Bob] Like frostbite. - Right, exactly. 20 minutes on there, and that should help calm that down as well. Number three is avoid activities that irritate it. So if walking irritates it, you're gonna obviously have to walk, but you're gonna limit. You're not gonna go on long shopping sprees, or go our for a walk and think you're gonna walk through it. - That's where the cane might help. It can help you walk further. But the other thing that is very common. Quite often people will have bursitis, and they tend to sleep on that side. - Right. - So you definitely want to avoid sleeping on that side. Let's say you're avoiding it, but you still need to do this adjustment, otherwise you're still putting stress on it. So let's say your bursitis is on the right side here, on the upper leg, and you're doing the right thing. You're not gonna sleep on it. Well if you take this pillow away, this leg rotates and it pulls on the hipbone here. The muscles do. So you definitely want to use a pillow between your legs, and that'll take the stress off that area and it'll help it calm down. Get that good night rest, and it's going to allow your body to heal a lot better and faster. - Right, and then the other thing that you can do, it just depends on you, if you respond well to NSAIDs like ibuprofen. Take that for-- I don't like to take those long-term. I think if you do it three times a day for three days in a row, it's going to do what it's going to do while you're doing these other things. - Yeah, and you have to make sure you're allowed to take them. But we've had pharmacists that recommend that you might take kind of a higher dose. You should ask your doctor or pharmacist. - Right. - Take a higher dose for three days and then just stop, and really try to blast it. - Always take those with food, but again, get that okayed with your doctor so you're not-- - NSAIDS, Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory... Drugs? D's, right? (laughs) - They're anti-inflammatory drugs. - We just call them NSAIDs. - NSAIDs, yeah. - Anti-inflammatories. - Ibuprofen's probably the most common. Now let's get to the exercises. - Sure. - Stretches, okay. - So we're going to try to stretch to take some of the stress off that bursa so there's not as much pressure on it. - Now these stretches we won't get too aggressive with. Depending on how inflamed it is, or how sore it is, but this is one you can do this on your floor or bed or even your couch. And you do cross like this, and you're gonna pull this knee across your body like this. You can see this right here, the white stripes on my pants, represent that IT band and some of the other tissues that are gonna cross that bursa. And stretch them out. Now if you do this and it hurts, and it's so inflamed it hurts, you need to rest. Don't do it. It should just feel like a nice comfortable stretch. Hold, and do this, you know, five to ten times, and it should feel good. You know, and then give it a break. Do that three times a day. The other one is, you lay down like this with your knees up. You can have a pillow; you can do this one in bed easily. And you cross, put your right ankle just below your left knee like this. I call it the Figure 4 Stretch. And you're gonna bring your left knee, my left foot comes off the bed, and you pull gently like this. Don't get too aggressive with it. You should be relaxed. And hold and stretch. - [Bob] Come on, Brad, let's say you're unable to do those. Let's say you're not as mobile. You could just start off like this, and bring it over and give it a good stretch like that, keeping your back down, keeping everything and allowing it to stretch that. This is kind of a gentle, a good start-stretch. - Right. That's a good point, Bob, because we do have, particularly some of our older people, do have a hard time. - [Bob] Getting into those positions. - Yep, thank you. - [Bob] That's a real pretzel there. (laughs) There's also the standing wall stretch. Should I show that one? - Sure, you bet. - So you could try this one too, if you're maybe a little less flexible. You go up against the wall. You're gonna be about, I don't know, I'm about three feet away from the wall. It's going to depend on your height. I'm gonna lean against on my forearm. I'm gonna stretch this one, the right one, so I'm gonna cross this one over like that. And then I'm just gonna lean like this. I'm gonna lean my pelvis into the wall. And so this is one most people can do. I mean a variation of this is just to go ahead and lean this way, and not even cross it over. But I always find it a lot easier, and it's more stable, and it's just easier to do. So obviously you do both sides, too. You cross over, and go like this, too. So you can see both angles. - Yeah and you're gonna spend a minute or two doing that stretch, and you can put the pressure on, pressure off, and work with that. Um, what was I going to say? - I was just thinking of a joke. I think this was in Reader's Digest. A lady was stretching, going against her car, and a guy comes up to her and starts pushing the car, he thinks that she's-- - Helping her out! (laughs) - This is Minnesota, that's what's gonna happen. - Right. Or I suppose they're gonna try and push the wall over. - Try to push the wall over for you. - Now the other thing, we've got a strengthening exercise. To get those muscles strengthened in that area. This works good if you have one of these loop bands, like this that stretches, I'll show you. You can start without one of these. - Yeah I, in fact, would recommend you do start without it because these are small muscles and to build them up you want to do a couple reps for a couple weeks probably. If you jump right into the band like I did, and I was doing it every day, I got a little sore. - Got a little sore. So you're gonna lay on your side. So this would be the involved side. Things are starting to feel better, it's a little calmed down, we want to start strengthening. And we call this the clamshell, because it looks like clamshell. You're not gonna do them real fast. It's up and then bring them down. And if you can, keep a gap between here. Don't let it touch and rest. Up, and there you got an inch or two in between there, and at about a pace like this you're gonna do 10 to 20 of them. You'll feel, as a matter of fact, right now I can feel that muscle right there. Like Bob said, we're working some small muscles. We're not going the glute maximus here. And when you get tired, you give it a break, and then you can do another set of 10 to 20. You can do three sets of those, as long as it's not too much. When that gets too easy, you can see I've got my little loop band right here. - [Bob] He moves it down. - Yeah, put it down by your knees, and that'll definitely give you the extra resistance you need. You're gonna probably cut down to 10 repetitions. - [Bob] These come in different colors. Generally, the lighter the color, the easier it is.

I thought, \"Oh I'm in good shape.\" And I was doing it every day for a while, and and like, oh my God, I got so fired up I couldn't sleep on that side. I had to ice it. I had to massage it. - That's the price you pay for being a man. - Yep. (laughs) - It's a guy thing. - What does that mean? - It's a guy thing; guys always overdo it! - Oh yeah sure. We're idiots.

        "video_title": "Protein Loss in Kidney Failure | How to stop protein loss in kidney disease | Proteinuria",
        "video_sub_title": "hello friends my name is Dr. Puru Dhawan and in this this video we will talk about protein loss in a kidney failure patient because in kidney failure patient when the person urinates what happen because of the presence of protein in the urine the urine becomes frothy and this froth denotes the health of your kidney this is the first symptom which appears in all kidney failure patients before the rise of creatinine so lets start how we can control protein loss in a kidney failure patient and how we can control the level of creatinine in a kidney failure patient before moving towards the treatment for protein loss in a kidney failure patient it's very important for us to understand why this happens what goes wrong in a kidney failure patient when a patient suffer from kidney because of blood pressure or sugar level or IgA nephropathy the membrane which is filtering each and everything in body which is the main the functional unit of the body which is known as the nephron is unable to keep the protein inside the body because of the pressure of blood pressure because of the high sugar level this membrane leaks protein and when the leakage happens this protein comes into urine and makes the urine frothy so in a kidney failure patient when we want control loss of protein we have to go to the cause of kidney failure and in most cases in 40% cases the cause of kidney failure is your high blood pressure what happens in your high blood pressure is that when your blood pressure is high this blood enters in your kidney with very high pressure because of this pressure it causes strike to the wall of the thin membrane of the nephron constant strike blood with the membrane  this membrane starts making changes in itself so it can survive during this mutation during this changes the membrane becomes sclerosed membrane becomes thick membrane becomes hard and when this happens it looses it function to filter out the blood and as the function of the that membrane goes the level of creatinine start increasing the kidney start losing protein from the body so if we want to control the level of protein in a kidney failure patient we have to control the level of blood pressure first without controlling blood pressure we can't control the protein loss we can't control the level of creatinine so we have to take care of the root cause of the kidney failure if we want to control if you want to manage that patient same thing is happening in the case of diabetic nephropathy patient who suffer from chronic kidney disease because of diabetes what happens because of this high sugar level in the blood first the nephron cells become weak second thing what happens our kidney works as a pressure wall for the sugar  if your sugar level increases above 200 what happens kidney opens its gate for the sugar and sugar starts moving out of the body through urine  so if this happens again and again on a daily basis what happens because of this high workload to the kidney kidney gradually stops kidney  starts loosing its function so if we want to control same thing if we want to control the diabetes if we want to control the diabetic nephropathy we have to control the diabetic first we have to make the make sure that the level of sugar is in the right amount one more thing happens with the patient diabetic nephropathy few drugs that are given as antidiabetic drugs  to the patient of diabetes these drugs open the gate of sugar forcefully  so that the level of sugar can be controlled in the body even before the level reaches the 200 and when we process sugar from the body forcefully through the kidney this damages the kidney and as the damage is happened kidney loses its function and as the function looses the level creatinine the protein lose increases so we have to take care of diabetes first if we want to control the chronic kidney disease in a diabetic nephropathy cases so these are the 80% cases so the 40% of the kidney failure is caused by high blood pressure another 40% is caused by diabetes and 10% is caused by IgA nephropathy and another 10% is caused by polycystic kidney IgA nephropathy and polycystic kidney both are the genetic disorder we will discuss these disorder in the later video but if we want to control chronic kidney disease if we want to control protein in any kidney failure patient we have to control the root cause of that problem that is your high blood pressure your sugar level or your immunity so we have to work on the root cause  if we want to control the level of protein now to control the level of creatinine and protein loss in a kidney failure patient we have to start kidney function restoration treatment in this treatment what we do step number 1 we have to control the cause of kidney failure is in control we can move to step number 2 in step number 2 what we do with the help of ayurvedic medicines, we increase the kidneys function and as the kidney function increases the output of creatinine urea potassium and other electrolytes also increases and as the output increases the levels of creatinine urea drops in the body so it important for us to increase the kidneys function because we all know once the nephron are damaged they remain damaged but we can increase the function of the healthy nephron now lets take an example suppose i have donate 1 kidney to some one else i have only 1 kidney left with me but this kidney will perform all the functions properly my level of creatinine won't increases my level of urea won't increases  my level of potassium won't increase the question arises why because kidney has the ability to increase its function  according to the need so we have to use this property of the kidney so that the remaining functioning part of the kidney  can increase it functions so it can filter creatinine urea potassium with a great efficacy  so that it can control the level of all other waste material easily now lets move to step number 3 once the cause of kidney failure is in control the level of creatinine urea is in control  the 3 step happen because of these favorable condition inside the body starts making some kind of changes in itself kidney starts increasing its function and as the natural function increases now the body doesn't need any kind of medicine any kind of support now kidney is self capable of filtering out the all kind of waste material on its own but in this KFRT treatment diet plays a very important role we consider diet as a 50% part of the diet with the help of diet we can control lots of thing in a kidney failure patient, we can control the level of creatinine we can control the level of potassium  so its very important  for all kidney failure patient to understand what kind of diet they should so that the level of creatinine  can be easily controlled so lets start with the creatinine creatinine is a waste material which is produced in our muscles and if we want to control the level creatinine we have to decrease the level of muscle metabolism and when a patient of kidney failure take large amount of protein this muscle metabolism increases and as the results the level of creatinine increases so all the patient of Sai Sanjivani suffering from kidney failure are advised to take a low amount of protein or they can take a protein-free diet if their body is strong enough and when we put patient on the low protein diet or protein free diet what happens because of this the level of formation of creatinine decreases and the level of creatinine also decreases in the body but protein is the building block of the body if we stop taking protein for a long time our body deteriorates so we can't do that we have to take those protein which are easily absorbable easily digestible and they doesn't create any kind of creatinine in the body so at Sai Sanjivani we advise all kidney failure patient to take moong ki daal without chilka because this is the vegetarian source of protein which is very good which is easily absorbable which is easily assimilated which doesn't contain any kind of creatinine in the body, so it is very important to stick things which we provide you which we suggest you so as we know that the creatinine is produced in the muscle  so we have to take care of the muscle metabolism suppose a patient of kidney failure do a lot of exercises lot of heavy exercises weight lifting and all what happens because of the increased metabolism of the muscles the creatinine increases and if the patient suffer from any kind of fever or some kind of shivering happens because of some cold climate what happens the level of creatinine increases so we have to take care of all these things now lets move to the potassium and see how level of potassium in a kidney failure patient potassium is present in each and every thing whatever we eat but few thing contains potassium naturally in low amount and few things contain naturally in high amount so we have to select food item which contains potassium in low amount so lets move vegetables and see how we can control the level of potassium in body with the help of vegetables any vegetable which is grown below the surface of earth contains potassium in high amount  like potato sweet potato turnip  any vegetable which is grown below the surface of earth similarly any vegetable  which is leafy like your mustard spinach coriander mint  all these vegetables contain potassium in higher amount so we have to avoid all these vegetables so we have to avoid rooty and leafy vegetables so the question arises what kind of vegetable we can eat we have to take those vegetable which are what we can say which are grown as a fruit on a plant or creeper like brinjal tomato bottle gourd round gourd pumpkin any kind of vegetable which is grown on a creeper or a plant as a fruit can be easily taken so if you take these kind of vegetable level of potassium will remain in a normal range and you don't have to leach the vegetable because  lots people come to me lots of patients come to me and they say can we leach the vegetable and i always suggest them to avoid leaching because when we advice leaching to a patient  what happens beacuse leaching not only the potassium lots of vitamins minerals  which is very much required by the body to heal the kidney is also leached away so we don't want to lose  those vitamins and minerals we have to provide those minerals and vitamins to the body so avoid leaching try to select those food item which contain potassium in the low amount now lets move to the fruits and how fruits can help a patient to control the level potassium in case of fruits we have to avoid few fruits and rest fruits can be easily given we have to avoid banana avocado kiwi and dry fruits dates and coconuts these are the 6 items which has to be avoided in category of fruits rest  fruits can be given you can give papaya you can give chiku you can give apple you can give grapes any fruit you want but quantity size potion size is very important don't cross the one cup of potion size suppose you want to give strawberrys one cup if you want to give apple and if you want to give papaya one cup of papaya these portion size will limit the potassium content in the body  so incase of fruits take care of the potion size so lets back to the creatinine and see what kind of food item has be avoided if you want to control the creatinine levels we have to avoid all kind of non veg items specially like chicken mutton fish lamb dairy products like milk custard and curd has to be avoided because if don't avoid these kind of things the muscle metabolism will increases and formation of creatinine will increase limit the amount of protein and type of protein to one bowl of moong ki daal if you take one cup of moong ki daal the level of creatinine won't increase it will remain stable it will go down and if we move to other pulses for source of protein what may happen is that because other pulses are hard to digest they may create creatinine in the body so we have to avoid other pulses but the exception is moong ki daal and stick to this level won't increases in future  so lets move back to the topic if we want to control the level of protein loss we have to take care of our kidney first we have to stop the damage and to stop the damage we have to work on the cause of kidney failure these are the simple basics what we use at Sai Sanjivani to control the level of Creatinine potassium protein in a kidney failure patient if you have any question the query you can simply ask from the number given below you can also book an appointment with me on the same number you can also visit our website Saikidneycare.com for further information with this allow me to say good bye see you in the next video till then bye",

        "video_title": "Femoral Nerve Entrapment - Front of Thigh Numbness from Running - Huntington Beach",
        "video_sub_title": "hi I'm doctor Sebastian's all this video is going to be actually a femoral nerve entrapment you can actually which is gonna present some really odd symptoms actually it's gonna first start up here it's gonna feel actually like just tightness in the front part of the hip but then you can have decreased sensation down the leg this way and a lot of times people will think it's actually referred pain from let's say ITV on problems or quad issues but the end in reality if you have decreased sensation down this way there's a very strong possibility is you have either a peripheral nerve entrapment up here or there's something more along of a central nerve entrapment which is gonna be more along the spine now the intent of this video is mainly to show you different anatomical structures in the area figuring out what your basic anatomy is and if you have this problem at all in the first place lots of people try to go through usually to figure out hey I can find some videos on how to stretch this area but back the matter is you don't know if you have it or not you should always go see a doctor to figure out a Hummer sense what it is but at the same time going in knowing anatomical structures yourself I think it helps you figure out and communicate with your doctor better typical symptoms with this is not only in just a tightness overall but also you can have pain with driving a car because you're having to lift the leg up but also doing things like putting your pants on because you haven't lift the leg so anything with resisted like motion especially against gravity or more you're gonna notice problems with in here so palpating the area is gonna is going to be the most important thing that you can do on your own to figure out what you have first one landmark you want to find here is called the anterior or the ASIS anterior superior iliac spine in yoga and the month the next muscle you can find is going to be the rectus femoris and if you push up this way she's gonna push your leg firmly against my hand you're gonna feel the muscle pop up go ahead relax that's gonna be the rectus femoris as it comes up into that region just off the inner part you can feel it drop in there's going to be the psoas tendon as well as the iliacus which turn into the same tendon and just enter more from that if you can actually feel a pulse then you're gonna be around where the femoral artery is in the femoral vein artery nerve are all in the same area right here sometimes if you hold this down long enough you can fill the pins and needles and loss of sensation within the leg down this way that would be more the femoral nerve basically becoming compressed which can happen in this condition already things you should probably know in the area as well is that obviously the femoral nerve is the main one the front side the Sadek nerve is the main one on the back side many people think that just because they have leg pain is gonna be a sciatic nerve issue but rally it's not so again femoral nerve this side lateral femoral cutaneous nerve on this side which can be correlated to the same type of issue in here so educating yourself about the area before you go meet your doctor is probably a great idea traditionally this will happen with mainly overuse so there's not sometimes there is actually a pop that people feel and that can be sometimes within the hip flexor tendon the psoas or iliacus but at the same time I've seen just as many people if not more that had no way of this happening at all sometimes I'll go on long plane flights or car rides and this will just start to become tight and then they'll get the referred type of conditions down down the leg creeping down this area actually I've ever heard of something you should go to somebody okay myofascial release I prefer Active Release Technique something specific to get in the area because if this is one of those areas I don't recommend you work on it all on your own you can stretch the area out but I can tell you from personal experience that it's just like an uncomfortable tightness and it's hard to relieve on your own unless you have some good amount of pressure in there within a safe area there's a vein artery nerve within the area and that's obviously the reason why we're doing this video but at the same time you can also compress those if you use things like baseballs or foam rollers within the area I prefer like I said Active Release it's a very specific way to get pressure on the area while you're linking the tissue underneath your contact point it's been been very effective for the people that I've seen for this condition so if you haven't tried it I would give it a try thanks for watching everyone and feel free to go onto the website check out the other videos we have I've been trying to put out tons of videos educationally to basically teach everyone had to know their body better there's actually a book as well it's called prevention of overuse and sports injuries I wrote it it was on 10 different cases that basically I've had that I've seen continually throughout the years it seems like there's lots of different common factors that these people have that they probably could have been probably could have prevented if they would have known about it ahead of time so go ahead and check that book out and thanks for watching",

        "video_sub_title": "in this video we're going to look at the first step when you're performing wound care and that is actually assessing the wound itself so in order to do that the very first thing that you need to do is remove the existing dressing now when you're doing this you can wear clean gloves and just gently pull back being careful of the tape sometimes I say the worst thing we do to patients is pull tape off now just know that if you do need to get deeper in and remove some kind of packing like you see here you'll need to use sterile gloves or you can use sterile forceps so if you get the sterile forceps you can use those to gently and carefully remove the packing from inside of the wound so now that the wound is exposed you can actually assess it so first you want to look at the color and the characteristics of the wound bed is it red are there streaks of yellow is it black or green is it moist is it dry is it leathery those are all gonna tell you a lot about what's going on in this case the wound bed is red and bumpy which tells us there's some granulation tissue which means it's beginning to heal you also want to look at the drainage and the edges of the wound in this case they're uh naproxen ated but straight most of the time I look at the old dressing to look at the drainage characteristics in this case there's some sea row sanguinis red drainage now it's time to measure the wound so take your tape measure and hold it above the wound measure from the patient's head to toe that's your length and then measure from the patient's left to right that's your width now we want a measured depth but we don't want to just stick this tape measure in the wound because the wound needs to say sterile so instead we want to get a sterile cotton-tipped applicator open the package in a sterile fashion keeping one end of the cotton tip applicator sterile at all times the end that you keep sterile you're actually going to stick that down into the wound bed until you reach the bottom of it and then you're going to mark with your finger how deep that wound is and then you can net use the cotton-tipped applicator to measure on your tape measure that way we're not sticking our finger down inside of the wound so if you have any tunneling or undermining in your wound you can measure those areas with a new cotton tip applicator in the same fashion so now you have all of your assessment information you can move on to the dressing change if you need to pause to write down your findings so you don't forget them so you can document them later thanks for watching another nursing comm lesson click the link below in the description to watch thousands more lessons over on nursing comm also be sure to hit the subscribe and the little bell to make sure you're reminded when new lessons come out and if you want to just keep watching more lessons go ahead and click this video over here to continue learning like we always say here at nursing calm happy nursing [Music]",

        "video_sub_title": "today I'm going to be showing you how to make a magnetic compass using materials you most likely have in your house the first material is a bowl of water about 1/2 an inch deep you should also have a needle and a magnet that should be relatively strong a compass if you want it to see if you're accurate and a scrap piece of paper about one inch by two inches long the first step is to poke holes and your scrap piece of paper and lying if you line the needle up next to the holes the tips should be sticking out about 1/4 inch longer than the holes next up is to take your sharp end of your needle and rub it against the magnet about 50 times all going the same way this is very important now what this is doing is it's magnetizing the needle so that it will temporarily become a magnet and if you use the magnet too much it will wear off now get the magnet out of there so that the compass like you can see here won't move around and go crazy now the next step is take your needle and string it through the hole you made in your paper now it then gently carefully put your paper on the water and having a compass next to it if you're if you did this correctly the needle and the compass should point um about the same way it doesn't have to be exact it might just move around because it's in water there's nothing to stabilize it and there you have it compass and a bowl of water with a needle and paper they see in the same way because this needle is magnetized",

        "video_title": "Overhead Shoulder Mobility (FIX THAT SHOULDER RANGE OF MOTION!!!) - Melbourne Myotherapist",
        "video_sub_title": "Dom McKay musculoskeletal therapist here to talk to you about overhead shoulder mobility and give you ways to improve it but first of all let's have a look at the basic components behind shoulder mobility or lack thereof overhead shoulder mobility has essentially three components the shoulder itself the movement of the scapula and the position and the degree of mobility in the thoracic spine let's break these down and have a look at each component individually normally the shoulder itself is actually being restricted by the soft tissues around it this can easily be addressed through myofascial release techniques dry needling and stretching now I would caution you against exercises which attempt to mobilize the joint capsule itself as this is rarely a major factor unless we're looking at a shoulder that's been through surgery the shoulder's such a mobile joint anyway that further mobilization of the actual capsule could potentially destabilize it if you look at the example in this photo you'll notice that the right scapula has rotated upwards in order to accommodate the arm being overhead restrictions in this movement of the scapula will therefore cause a lack of overhead shoulder mobility movement through the thoracic spine is an integral component to increasing overhead shoulder mobility now if you look at the hunched position it has a direct and significant impact on the angle of the arms when trying to reach above your head people who struggle with movement through the thoracic spine will often compensate by arching through the lower back in order to get those hands above their head so let's look at some exercises to address all these concerns okay so band up and over are one of my favourite shoulder mobility exercises because it just cuts straight to the chase and gets right into what we're trying to achieve so taking a thera-band or you can use a power band or even a flexible rod of some sort you grab either end now it's important to hold a good posture as you're doing this so we're focusing on drawing the chin back whilst focusing on tucking the pelvis under and keeping that core switched on and you slowly lift the arms bring them up and back all the way behind your body and then all the way back again so just focusing on that posture as you do this so you feel that immediately starts to loosen up all across the shoulder girdle okay so cows face is an awesome stretch for your tricep it also helps with internal rotation of the shoulders but in this case we're actually aiming to mobilize the shoulders above our head so we're stretching the tricep now if you can reach your hands together behind your back then you can simply do it that way so I'll give you an example of that first and in this situation I'd be trying to pull my right arm as far up as possible but more often than not if you're having shoulder mobility issues you're not going to be able to do that so I'll show you using a thera-band as a way to bridge that gap so essentially you just throw that over the shoulder and grab it from behind and then you just pull down until that increases the stretch so this can be held for 30 to 60 seconds or up to two minutes however much you can handle the more the better so these are my favorite stretches for pecs and lats which are essentially what's internally rotating your shoulders so bracing the arm against a doorway or you can just use the hand if you want a longer lever and then turnout away from your arm so you're going to feel a stretch all the way through the chest there and you can try different angles to get different fibers and then with the long lever it changes it again so after a minute or so you'll start to really feel an opening through the pecs there in terms of the lats I like to brace myself against the doorway and really try and get that stretch going up through the lats so this is how I do it so I hold the doorway with both hands and then I use my front leg to push myself away and really try and get a stretch all the way up through there so if you're doing this correctly you'll really feel this start to open up and again the response to that is just this more surrendered neutral position in the shoulders so a fantastic way of releasing tension through the thoracic is with this guy this is a lacrosse ball you can use a spiky ball or even a tennis ball depending on how much pressure you feel you need but essentially we're going to be working up close to the spine while we move our arm in the direction we want it to go which is above our head so begin by placing this on the ground and you're literally going to lie on top of it aiming to butt it up right next to the spine so you'll feel an incredible degree of discomfort but I just want you to work with that so when you find a sore point you lift the arm above the head push through the pain try and relax through it and you can move around to different areas wherever you feel most tight after a couple of movements of the arm you'll find that things will start to loosen off again and then again you move up to the next point that's most restricted okay so you can try that for a couple of minutes or you know link it in with all the other exercises you're doing to work on this thoracic extension component you probably want one of these a foam roller you can kind of make do with towels but these are cheap anyway so I'd suggest getting one so if you've watched my rounded shoulders video and how to correct them then this exercise will look a bit familiar there's just a couple of differences so you lie your back on to the foam roller and you clasp your hands behind your head now relax the neck and let the head fall into the hands and really feel like you can just open up through that spine and what you're doing is you're searching for the stiffest points and working with them so through this movement you'll feel like it starts to unlock and wherever your stiffness is is really where you want to focus on this so integrate these in with all the rest of the exercises this is an important one for the thoracic extension component of what we're going to do so you know spend a good couple of minutes on this one so another really good way to use this lacrosse ball is to release the pec and the front of the shoulder with it so I'm going to be dealing with a microphone here so excuse me so you lie the ball first um place it on the ground and just put your shoulder and pec over it and then you're essentially just going to be rolling around trying to find any key points and you can move the arm around as well and just get into all the little corners that feel stiff and tight and just focus on mobilizing them so it will only take a minute or two to really start to feel that open up through that myofascial release with the ball if you're trying to improve your shoulder mobility in order to achieve better overhead lifts at the gym then I'd suggest doing these exercises right before a workout you'll find that the lifts will actually reinforce the newfound mobility that you've just achieved in all other cases these can be performed on a daily basis until shoulder mobility is returned feel free to ask questions in the comments section I'm happy to answer them there there's a link to my website in the description below

        "video_title": "diy acid reflux burn spray for GERD & LPR",
        "video_sub_title": "heyyou traversed more drama of it guys this video is specifically just for people who have GERD or acid reflux people who get burning sensation in their throat esophagus nose or even in their ears which is from their acid reflux you have two different types of acid reflux you have that when the liquid comes up and you have the silent type where you just aerosols come up or people don't get heartburn and they don't really know what's going on until they start losing their voice now when you go to the doctor they are before you go to the doctor a lot of people they start taking antacids which neutralizes the stomach acid or you go to the doctor and they gave you protein pump inhibitors that reduce the acid your stomach and people sometimes use remedies at home with baking soda at sever the stomach but if you have something coming up into your throat it really is helpful if you could just make a little spray to spray in your throat or your nasal passages to neutralize the acid in the pepsin test lining your nasal passages and your throat instead of adding all of these stuff and your stomach to reduce your ass because you need your acid to absorb the nutrients into your body you have very high incidence of people not being able to absorb b12 in their body or magnesium because they're adding all of these chemicals to their stomach to get rid of the acid but if you're trying to just get rid of the acid in your throat and your nasal passages here's a little spray you can make you want to take distilled water clean water if you have to still water you want to boil your water for 20-30 minutes and in this video when I say you I should say meat because I'm not a doctor and I'll play one on YouTube and I can't really give you medical advice if you have a problem you should go to a doctor but this is what I do and if I do say in the video you it's the editing problem I should have said hi so just ignore when I see you I use a half a liter of water that's clean because I'm going to be spraying it into my nose or my throat and one level tablespoon not teaspoon into the water and dissolve it over the baking soda which is just good ol n hco3 and once you do that go to the store and get you one of these nasal spray bottles that come with nasal spray empty it out and rinse it out a few times by adding liquid and then spraying it out again and then put your mail your your acid reflux spray that's you made into the bottle any time you feel a burning sensation your throat or your nasal passages you can do this and what it does it'll get rid of the acid but also looking for the pepsin because when you have GERD reflux or if you have aerosols come into your throat the pepsin also comes up not just acid in lines your nasal passages and your throat anytime you eat acidic foods then it causes a chemical reaction and it starts harming your tissue and your in your in your body so this will help neutralize the acid and the pepsin which is an enzyme from your stomach that gets into your larynx and your throat in your nasal passages so try this so instead of eating a lot of tums or these other chemicals and stuff try making this if you having a throat problem renee has a problem and don't forget the water has to be super clean you're going to be spraying nature nose your mouth I checked the pH of my water home it was acidic also oddly enough I thought the distilled water would be 7.0 be neutral but L so it was acidic but once you add these the baking soda it will become alkaline about eight eight point five I think according to my paid strips now that's it for the nasals for the the acid reflux spray that you can make by the way this was told to me by doctors and it's something I have confidence in but you might want to talk to other people and make up your own line and then not just go by what I tell you or what anybody tells you on YouTube you want to get more information but here's some more information you might want from me and it's not medical advice but it's what I learned from reading and doing research is that the reflux problem isn't really a problem of acid or pepsin and in your nasal passages or your throat or learners the problem comes from you have a sphincter a valve and top and bottom of your stomach that lets liquid in or out and the problem is the sphincter at the top of your just your stomach is letting the liquid come up or the aerosols there is one thing I found after doing the research a National Institute of Health did a study or the melatonin will actually help your your your sphincter shut and work properly now they did find it worked better with certain supplements but it also is also it also works along without the supplement but not as good I don't have the way to to make all the different supplements and add them the correct ratio but I've been using the melatonin and I've had good results with it else also sleep I sleep longer and better with it and it has less side effects and some of these other pills when you take things like the that proton proton pump inhibitors they do have side effects and the long-term usage I know some people claim they get osteoporosis from it and some people have claimed problems with cognitive impairment which is another word for saying they're having memory problems and there's other issues so I I always tried to do the least harmful first and work up to the more harsh stuff and melatonin seems to be one of the least problematic but anything you take even even salt water even sugar anything it has an opposite effect if something is strong enough usually not always but usually in my opinion and I'm not a doctor but usually if something is strong enough to help you or fix something it's also strong enough to be too harming something in some way causing our reaction on the other side you want to research melatonin and see what you think but I've been taking two and a half milligrams at night to see if it will help the valve in my stomach and by the way I found out about this problem when I had my eighth hip I had operation and it looks like there was a contact ulcer so I went to the doctor and she said at the contact officer and then I had been taking the proton pump inhibitor for 30 days and after I stopped taking it I started getting reflux so they would prescribe more proton pump inhibitor so you know what let me find out what the problem is instead of trying to cover up the symptoms so that's where I'm at if you get acid reflux you get a burning sensation try making this spray I'm gonna be putting out more information as I find about acid reflux and GERD and in LPR and hope you guys come back watch my videos I put new stuff on every week brand new stuff been doing it for 10 years I need to find a chemical for healthy to stop making videos I can't stop I'm addicted hope this little video helped you guys I'm rambling here it's time to go I'll put links to the National Institute of Health on the melatonin the study and the other studies I found in the video description hope this guy helped this helps you guys and come back a lots more and good luck with with your with your acid reflux",

        "video_sub_title": "hi everybody this is Michele from virtual hand care if you have numbness and tingling in your fingers at nighttime and you're having a hard time sleeping I'm going to show you a quick technique that you can do at home to help you sleep better at night so if you have numbness and tingling in your ring finger and your small finger usually that is from what's called cubital tunnel that is your ulnar nerve gets compressed right in this area here and oftentimes people get numbness and tingling at nighttime because they're sleeping with their arm bent and underneath them sometimes they get numbness and tingling because they lay with their arms completely straight also and if they have bony elbows it could be compressing against their body so a simple and cheap way to help that is to use towels now usually the conservative treatment is to sleep with a big splint with your arm around anywhere from 30 degrees to like 60 degrees you don't want to splendide agrees or more because that's not gonna help your symptoms so instead of sleeping with some big splint that locks your arm in that location you can use a towel so I like to get a big fluffy towel and I like to wrap it around the arm the majority of the thickness of the towel is on the top of the elbow that will prevent you from going into that full flexion and when you sleep you're not curling that elbow all the way in so what you would want to do is wrap it around your elbow and then take an ace wrap and then wrap it around or you could take some tape and wrap it around in this position and then all you have to do is just slip it right off put it by your bedside and then the next night just slip your arm right back in and sleep that way now another technique is if you are having numbness and tingling into the fingers more of the thumb index middle and part of the ring which could be more carpal tunnel or your median nerve if you're sleeping with your wrists bent at night and curled with your wrist oftentimes people do that and it compresses the median nerve causing the numbness and tingling so you could do the same thing but with a little bit of a smaller towel you could sleep with the splint I do recommend that that might be a little more comfortable for you but if you can't sleep with us blend or it's just too much for you to spend at the moment try a towel and a towel might be a little more comfortable for you so again simply wrap the towel around your wrist and then what you want to do is then take some ace wrap again or tape and you've got yourself a little homemade splint and then you can sleep at night with that and that will help you prevent you from going and sleeping into that full flexed position that's making your numbness and tingling and again you can just slip it off and then just slip it right back on the next night I hope that helps you I let me know in the comments below if you have tried this technique and it helped with your numbness and tingling liked this video and subscribe to virtual hand care thanks so much for watching",

men experiencing low testosterone packaging their solution in branding the issue as an epidemic conveniently funneling thousands and thousands of men into doctors offices where they were then handed prescriptions for hormone replacement therapy solutions and gels like and gel overnight this is a multi-billion dollar a year industry so what happened to all the guys most likely some people are watching this video - who are on this testosterone replacement therapy well your testosterone levels are likely back in the normal range in many cases though they're probably still on the low side depending on where you were starting from people might think this is good maybe bad I don't think it's good so what happens when you start using the gel so we're gonna find out in today's video all the information in today's video plus much more can be found in my book master your tea visit master your tea calm for a free digital download of the book $20 in value absolutely free for you well your body naturally produce enough testosterone to keep your levels where they are if you were to stop using this TRT gel no it won't at the very least it will take a significant amount of time to restore your natural endocrine function back to normal so here's the situation you end up being chained to rubbing an expensive smelly goo on your chest for the rest of your life or at least as long as you care about getting a boner that's no way to live the gute itself is a band-aid and what we need to do is actually get to the root of the issue learn to understand the cause of the malaise and then take action based upon what we know that's the process I used several years ago to take my own tea levels for basically nothing - way above normal way out of the medical reference range even on the top the first thing that the doctor gave me when I was diagnosed with the brain tumor that was blocking my testosterone production was a prescription for andrew gel so I took it for a few weeks but I decided to get rid of it because it didn't make any sense to me and I got rid of all the medications shortly thereafter when I made the decision to uproot the problem directly and solve it with a natural solution and that was the best choice in my life that was years ago and since then I've educated myself then I put that knowledge into action in my life the results speak for themselves I'm really confident I'll have high testosterone for my entire life because I now understand how to keep it that way I'll naturally have a slight decline with age but it'll never really reach the point to ever think twice about whether it's negatively affecting my life in any way right now my well-being is very high so it was my morning wood I can put on muscle and fairly quickly and stay a little body fat percentage year-round without any trouble I sleep like a bear in hibernation every night and I can grow a good beard if I choose to so I always gain strength and power in training and that's actually an important cause of the high testosterone more on that later on in this series and I'm pretty sure women can also smell it I also grew two inches in the mean time of increasing my my testosterone from very low to very high the task at hand for me at the moment is distilling this into a replicable process that you can use in your own life I'm gonna believe that things happen for a reason and it would appear as though all the trouble that I went through personally in all the years of self experimenting learning what works and what doesn't then my decision to become a writer and start my own company I've just led us all right to this moment so yeah I think it I was meant to share my knowledge with the world on this you should know this that medications and gels are not your only option you also don't need eat a dried tiger penis which is apparently common in ancient Chinese herbalism you can naturally increase your testosterone and growth hormone levels and then sustain your levels without this assistance it's a process and it'll take anywhere between six months to two years most likely but once you learn it and put it into action you'll be set it's time to begin building this foundation let's start learning so what is testosterone testosterone is the principal male sex hormones and androgen it's found in both males and females and acts anabolic Li while females naturally produce small amounts of testosterone and have far greater sensitivity to the introduction of additional testosterone into their systems men clearly are where testosterone is most prevalent which is seven and ten times the amount that's found in females and in whom testosterone is most often desired so it's secreted from the testes of males and the ovaries of females with small amounts also coming from the adrenal glands androgens are steroid hormones and can be produced naturally and synthetically the presence of androgens and tissues that have androgen receptors promotes protein synthesis in those tissues giving it its anabolic influence androgenic effects include much of what we consider to be human maturation especially in sexual tissues and organs for example androgens heavily influenced the maturation of male secondary characteristics such as the growth of the penis and scrotum body hair vocal sound and depth anabolic effects are characterized by things like muscle growth and strength as well as bone maturation increased density and increased strength testosterone gets to work in both males and females before we're even born and carries out its influence heavily first during the sexual differentiation process then into infancy prepubescent puberty adolescence and adulthood he plays a major role in many of the processes in the body one of the more prominent ones is formatted Genesis so without the presence of testosterone and/or the androgen receptor spermatogenesis can't proceed past meiosis I you can't pretty sperm in non-science e terms you're infertile so now that we know where testosterone is produced let's venture in to a guess about what might be the cause of low testosterone production there are two common culprits and medically recognizes primary and secondary hypogonadism first primary hypogonadism is caused by deficient testosterone production in the testes the boys aren't working properly second secondary hypo Kannada ism is caused by hypothermic pituitary irregularities so they regulate your endocrine system for example secondary hypogonadism can be caused when a piece of this puzzle isn't functioning properly i'm a via opinion that these processes both primary and secondary do not operate independently as evidenced by the strong influence of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland on the gonads directly so in the end it all comes back to brain health and therefore also gut health your gut is really your second brain and you can directly influence its health by what you put into your body for nutrition now we're getting somewhere so you'll recall that testosterone is producing the testes by cells called Leydig cells the average plasma concentration of testosterone human males typically falls somewhere in the range of 200 to 1000 nanograms per deciliter in terms of a timeline versus plasma concentrations over a lifetime T levels sharply rise during adolescence peak in a man's 20s and begin to slowly decline with age most potent and most widely recognized in the human male body is its influence over the growth and development of sexual tissues your testosterone level is also a good indicator of leading body mass with the right stimuli so elevated testosterone levels will include increased red blood cell production bone density sugar uptake into muscle tissue muscle glycogen storage and protein synthesis associated with muscle growth let's talk about the feedback loop involved the cascade of events that leads to testosterone production begins in the hypothalamus with the release of GnRH which acts on the pituitary to produce two hormones these two hormones are LH and FSH these are the ganado trip ins once in the bloodstream LH makes its way to the testicles where it exerts its influence on the lading cells triggering a series of events that turns cholesterol into testosterone as testosterone levels increase LH production transport slows so a negative feedback loop brain are communicating constantly to regulate important processes it's one of the countless feedback loops and there are a lot of different positive feedback loops as well in the human body but this negative feedback loop this the brain can constantly keep hormone levels in check in this case testosterone LH f sh and GnRH under normal healthy circumstances when a problem arises whether it's from a tumor a traumatic stressor or some summative built up a small unnoticeable stress this not only affects everything downstream it affects everything period because it's a loop so you'll notice that testosterone doesn't only linearly exert its influence back on the hypothalamus alone it can also work directly back to the pituitary essentially skipping a step if your body is looking to regulate ganado cope and release when this little system is working properly everything's good in the hood when something goes wrong down the line is when we run into noticeable issues FSH the other ganado tropen is chiefly responsible for stimulating or regulating production of sperm and the latex cells in the testes at this point we understand that testosterone production is regulated by the brain namely the hypothalamus and pituitary if you a handful of powerful hormones and synthesized by a number of intermediate steps from cholesterol in the latex cells and this process all tied together isn't in a negative feedback loop so now it's produced so what happens next so when testosterone is released into your blood and into your bloodstream it's actually entering a molecular game of tag so to speak so a carrier protein named SHBG or sex hormone binding globulin is released from the liver and shbg is it so SHP G's role is to regulate the level of freely circulating testosterone in your bloodstream so when it binds to a testosterone molecule that testosterone cannot effectively enter and exert its influence on a cell so the more SHBG is in the bloodstream the fewer testosterone molecules actually reach cellular target this isn't inherently a bad thing it's just the way things work it's another negative feedback loop meant to regulate your endocrine function however now I hope that you're beginning to realize just the sheer amount of self limiting processes that occur along the line in the cycle and none of your testosterone has actually had an effect on anything yet in the system that we're talking about so with SHBG in this role we now understand that testosterone levels and shbg levels are firstly correlated more shbg in your system the lower amounts of free active tea again if something small is affecting anything along this pathway you're likely getting experience that is an issue manifesting itself as lower than optimal tea levels for example you might have very high levels of free circulating testosterone well with the imbalance in shbg production much of that free tea won't reach a target which sucks so we'll discuss free testosterone and total testosterone further in future videos so if you like this information if you want to learn more about how to naturally optimize your testosterone every single subject that you could ever hope to learn

        "video_sub_title": "Another important element for oral hygiene within the accessories is basic dental floss. We have to take into account that it is enough to use it with a few minutes once a day or if there is very little time to use it three or four times a week. the important thing that we have to have in the thread there are different types with waxes or sincere others that come directly with the whole structure question independently what we have to do is take a long section with a short one more or less about 40 centimeters on little things So we move it and cut it and then on the index fingers we go around it the same on one side with the other which will allow us with the other fingers to be able to push it up or by moving the bottom one we place it between inter space  in such we are moving with a saw effect until we pass the point of contact in which we pass we lean on a face action to which we  we lean on that face we pull hard to be able to arrest it it starts a couple of times on each of the sides leaning against the surface of the tooth and pull the same and we have already done it towards the back face and the same we have to do towards the face  b In the second, the important thing that we have to keep in mind is not to hurt ourselves when we floss, there is a point of contact that is where one tooth rests against another and that point of contact is usually strong, so if we simply press down  what we end up with is that it ends up nailing the gum in order to exterminate the damage, so the way of placing and passing the dental fig simply rests between the interdental spaces and we make a small sawing movement that small moment of closure, which allows us  it is to pass as it just happened without hurting us once it is done because we have to do is support them towards a tooth and once it hits us  we move towards one of the teeth pull hard so that it can drag the entire plate the same thing we place it again with a sawing movement the same thing towards the other side when we have done it other times to one side we have to do the same thing we can place it  and we lean towards the inserted tooth and there is the same and a strong movement to be able to enter this other type of gone the physical prison it has is that they are already pre-cut and it has two structures it has a small part that is like a foam and the other  form that the third thread already comes and another part that is a little more rigid the objective is that we do not have to go over it but what we have to do is win it as if we were not basting we pass it between the space between the teeth and  we don't want to go past the space between the teeth simply with this surface that is foam what it is doing is that it is already doing a sweeping effect the same thing we have to do  It was a surface or one side of a ball and the same thing we have to do the same to the other side the advantage is that if we take almost the same work as if it were conventional dental floss in such a way that once we have finished it  going to the other end already acts and has a part as if it were dental floss where we would have to support them on one side first and then on the other important case, always when removing whatever it is, remove it strongly and quickly paste to insert it never a pressure but saw movement another of the elements that have appeared lately and that help us a lot in what is hygiene and interdental cleaning are the interdental brushes of interdental bills they usually come with their cover to be able to protect them well with a guide of colors that according to the color guide is what allows us to determine the size of the bristle that it is going to have based on the size that we have  What to take into account is depending on the space that we are going to find between the large teeth, because we use a brush that is a little larger than that which comes from the color guide, according to the color, it is the type of truth that we have in the spaces that are  extremely large we only focus on instead of the cylindrical ones we can use the short ones so that in order for us to occupy the entire space, always when trying to enter I prefer to enter a little from the back to the front I do not find it more comfortable because  many times by going forward backwards we hurt ourselves and it does not end up nailing the gum itself so the important thing is for each space for each area to find the brush that best suits our needs such as such a small space, of course a brush large would not fit I knew it would hurt we have to look for our age that is really smaller because it can fit we all use e  l toothbrush but many people are not aware that for complete hygiene you have to use dental floss once a day since the brushes cannot penetrate the interdental spaces this is how we will use it remember to introduce the floss with saw movements  between two teeth without much pressure so that it does not dig into the gum and hurt although there are several types of floss with fluoride with or without flavor etc. the best is the clinical wax test we take care of your mouth we take care of you",

        "video_sub_title": "this video was created by the Ohio Academy of Family Physicians to demonstrate proper technique for measuring blood pressure in an office setting about one in three American adults has hypertension the American Heart Association estimates the total costs associated with high blood pressure to exceed 40 billion dollars annually measurement of blood pressure is used in screening for hypertension and for monitoring the effectiveness of treatment for patients with a diagnosis of hypertension in the outpatient setting blood pressure is measured indirectly it is important to use proper techniques so that readings are consistent and reliable the 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults report from the panel members appointed to the eighth Joint National Committee also known as JNC eight guides current treatment of hypertension according to JNC eight patient 60 and older who do not have diabetes or kidney disease need to have blood pressure under 150 over 90 for all other patients the blood pressure goal is less than 140 over 90 taking a manual reading of indirect blood pressure requires a stethoscope and a sphygmomanometer the stethoscope used should have tubing long enough to allow the clinician to view the manometer while listening to kirat cough sounds the bell of the stethoscope should be used as it permits better auscultation of Korat cough sounds a sphygmomanometer consists of a blood pressure cuff containing a distensible bladder a rubber bulb with an adjustable valve and a flexible tubing the tube connects to a manometer which measures the pressure within the cuff each part of the sphygmomanometer should be examined on a regular basis to be sure that it is functioning correctly the needle on an aneroid manometer should rest at zero before and after each blood pressure measurement aneroid manometers should have calibration performed at least every six months blood pressure readings should be done when the patient is in a resting state the patient should be seated for five minutes prior to checking a blood pressure so that the reading is not artificially elevated due to the exertion of walking to the room the arms should be bared to the shoulder a study looking at the effect of taking blood pressure through clothing showed little average change but found that in patients with hypertension there can be individual differences of plus or minus 20 millimeters of mercury or more when compared with measurements on bare skin the patient must be correctly positioned to accurately measure blood pressure the patient needs to have legs uncrossed and feet resting on a firm surface the patient's back and legs should be supported by the chair the manometer should be at eye level of the care team member the patient's arms should be supported at heart level a common error in taking blood pressure is the use of an improperly fitted cuff the appropriate cuff size is determined by the circumference of the arm at the midpoint between the electron on process and the acromion process the cuff will have the size range listed in centimeters once the correct cuff is selected proper fit is verified using the index line that runs perpendicular to the length of the cuff and arranged line that runs parallel to the length of the cuff when a cuff fits appropriately the inflatable bladder should cover about 80% of the circumference of the patient's arm using a cuff that is too short and narrow results in erroneously high blood pressure measurement when a cuff is too large blood pressure measurements will be erroneously low the cuff should be applied to centimeters above the crease of the elbow it should fit snugly but still allow two finger widths under the cuff when the cuff is in place on the upper arm the index line should fall within the range line next and the brachial artery which is palpable about four centimeters from the medial epicondyle on the anterior surface of the elbow place the stethoscope lightly against the skin over the brachial artery being sure that the pressure is appropriate for good sound transmission make sure that the blood pressure cuff and clothing do not touch the stethoscope inflating the cuff to an arbitrary level will often lead to over inflation which can be uncomfortable for the patient determining the pulse obliteration pressure will avoid over inflation rapidly inflate the cuff to 80 millimeters of mercury while palpating the radial artery pulse continue to inflate in 10 millimeter of mercury increments until the pulse disappears then deflate the cuff at a rate of two millimeters of mercury per second noting the pulse obliteration pressure where the pulse reappears you are now ready to measure the patient's blood pressure inflate the cuff to twenty to thirty millimeters of mercury above the pulse obliteration pressure then deflate the cuff at a rate of approximately two millimeters of mercury per second while listening with the stethoscope for kirat cough sounds as the pressure in the cuff is decreased blood flow in the brachial artery increases which creates turbulence and generates korotkov sounds phase one cough sounds are clear tapping sounds that coincide with reappearance of a palpable radial or brachial pulse systolic blood pressure is determined by the onset of phase one sounds phase two and three sounds are of no clinical significance and are described as softer and longer than crisper and louder phase four sounds become muffled and softer as the pressure measurement approaches the diastolic pressure usually within ten millimeters of mercury of true diastolic pressure phase five sound is not a sound but rather is the level at which sounds disappear the diastolic blood pressure is measured at the start of phase 5 to ensure that diastole has been reached the cuff pressure should continue to be slowly deflated for an additional 10 millimeters of mercury beyond

listen for the various phases of the kirat cough sounds while you observe the reading on the manometer and a skull Tottori gap is defined as the intermittent disappearance of the initial korotkov sounds after their first appearance this phenomenon can lead to underestimation of systolic blood pressure obtaining the pulse obliteration pressure can be helpful in avoiding and correct measurement certain conditions such as cardiac arrhythmias may complicate blood pressure measurement or interpretation in these circumstances decreasing the rate of deflation and averaging several readings may improve accuracy observer bias is the most common error that occurs in blood pressure measurements it occurs because practitioners often show digit preference or round off the terminal digit when two people use the same correct technique for measuring blood pressure there should be little variation in the reading they obtain by following the process demonstrated in this video you will be able to correctly measure the blood pressure of your patients getting accurate measurements is crucial for your care team and your patient because blood pressure data is used to classify patients to stratify

        "video_sub_title": "hi everyone I apologized I'm in the bathroom I actually never do videos in the bathroom as you probably know I'm on holidays and this is the best for me to fix my phone on the on the magnifying mirror so I can show you what I want to show you so basically I came up with completely accidentally I came up with a technique which may potentially save a lot of time when you do in your eyes it especially is good for those who got light eyelashes blonds typically and this is something that will show you how very quickly very very quickly it might be the wildest way of darkening your eyelashes roots but it actually will very quickly effectively darken your eyelashes roots without using liquid eyeliner or mascara I found it very very useful but I came up with it completely accidently I was doing something I was doing on eyeliner and I blinked and somehow my arm my hand twist sort of switched and the line that came up was so good it was so it was like high-definition eyelashes so I said I've got to show you so the all you need is a pencil eyeliner normally the one you used I always use either do or Charlotte Tilbury and 99% of the time I would go for dark brown because that brings that makes my blue eyes or gray eyes pop better so this I has been done I'll just show you once again and this one I have done I've done these in Russian and I'm taking it off to show you once again how to start from scratch the only one thing because it it kind of darkens them it's almost like coloring them so well you might need a very good almost as strong as waterproof mascara remover or mr. low-water Bioderma or gosh L'Oreal I think it is I'm not sure which one is the micellar water that takes Greece and it takes a caller immediately off so so what I do is basically what I did I came up with it you close your you put pencil where your eyelashes start here and close it and you draw on the line between two closed eyelids that will take you it wouldn't as such as you can see it wouldn't research color your waterline because some people might be concerned because of the chemicals in pencils they don't want to go them in into the eye it actually leaves your waterline clean but it colors both top and bottom lines of your eyelashes roots so close it like this I'm just enhancing this one this has been done already that's it it takes five seconds I was amazed by what I came up with when I did this video in Russia and quite a few of them wrote back and said oh mom was doing it all life I remember our mom who's doing similar thing but she was doing it like waterline but not the actual rules so this is to me probably most effective way of doing of defining your roots of your eyelashes especially if you blonde without using any liquid without using mascara and without using any chemicals I quite often actually use gosh possible reflector sill reflector sill you can buy it on eBay on Amazon reflector sill is a special permanent colorant for your eyes you mix it with something and it all comes in the pack but this is better because it it doesn't wash I was in a swimming pool and then I had a shower and you know that is it just stays on it's really good the pencils I use pencil has to be really well sharpened I used your dark brown pencil it's got to be kind of it's good to be soft pencil I haven't tried it with Charlotte Tilbury yet I haven't tried with any other but this this is the dual pencil which I don't normally use so just I try do it with this hand so basically putting it right where your ashes lie ashes high lunch eyelashes start close it I'm trying to watch it what I'm doing and actually doing it it doesn't work that's it that's the route some of you might say stupid woman I've been doing it all my life if you have great so you came up to it earlier than I have but I am really really happy with it because it actually solves so many of my problems it defined eyes it makes them pop the color pop it doesn't do much on my waterline just a tiny bit there and it defines the top line of my eyelashes which is always the problem I know people have different techniques and they kind of color them from there and it is hard work especially if your hair naturally lights so I think this this is something works for me I thought maybe it works for you so I wanted to share with you if you didn't like it so be it but I hope it might be useful for some okay see you later",

        "video_title": "How to Make Hooded Eyes Look BIGGER! Natural / Everyday Makeup Tutorial! | Stephanie Lange",
        "video_sub_title": "hi guys welcome back to my channel today I have done a video for you that will hopefully show you how to make small hooded eyes look bigger basically making hooded eyes look bigger is different to making non hooded eyes look bigger if you have hooded eyes it is a little bit more difficult if you use too many shimmers metallics foils glitters things like that what they actually do is they will kind of emphasize the hood so if you apply those kinds of eye shadows on hooded eyes it's actually going to reflect the light and it's going to emphasize and highlight the hood of the eye of course you can do that if you want to but this video is going to show you how not to do that so in this video we're actually going to be using matte colors and contrary contrary and on the contrary contrary to popular belief is that an expression anyway going against popular belief that colors are no harder to blend than shimmery colors I don't know where that rumor started but personally I find it completely untrue why we use matte colors is because matte colors absorb the light so instead of highlighting and emphasizing hooded eyes they're actually going to absorb the light back in and it's going to make the call of the I appear like has been pushed back and but there is no hook there at all so it makes that area look like a crease instead of a hood if that's making any sense to at all keep on watching and hopefully it will make sense to you of course if you do not have hooded eyes you can absolutely do this you guys can do everything so don't feel like for one second that you can't do these hooded eye looks because you guys definitely can it's just us who divide people that struggle a little bit more every single product that I use will be linked in the description box down below so check it out if you want to without further ado let me get into the tutorial okay I'm working from one palette today this is a palette that I've had for ages and have actually never really gotten around to using and today I'm going to use it because it has all neutral nude colors and most of them are matte except for the highlight shades which is perfect when you're trying to make horrid eyes or bigger in a very natural way all right now step one with making eyes in general bigger you need to highlight so the areas that you always want to highlight are the inner corners of eyes here and underneath the arch of the brow bone I am taking this color here it is a shimmery yes shimmery pale pale pale pink highlight shade I'm just going to go to town with applying that on the inner corners of my eyes I'm also going to carefully apply it onto the arch of the brow bone what is this do not apply this highlight shade on the foot of your eyes so if there is not a lot of space between your eye and your eyebrow and you do not have a defined arch like me or other people don't worry just take a very very small precise brush rather than a chunky blending brush like this and use that to apply your highlight shade so that you can control exactly where you are applying it and make sure you do not get it on the hood of your eye and you only get it directly underneath the arch of the brow bone all right now I am taking this shade here am i yep this chain here which is a very very light talk and it is matte this this shade is going to go all over our mobile lid up into the crease in the dome shape so hopefully you guys have seen my other tutorials on hooded eyes and you know what I'm talking about when I say the dome shape I'm going to apply that with this brush here this is the base show brush from Real Techniques and what you want to do with the dome shape is not bring it past the inner corner of your eye and not bring it past the outer corner of your eye and you want to apply in a dome shape so kind of speaks for itself you okay so you can see how light that color is that is it compared to this eye which has no color yet as you can also hopefully see I've brought that up onto the hood of my eye so what you need to do is look at your self front on in the mirror if you open your eyes and you cannot see that you've applied any eye shadow for example if your hood has kind of drooped over and covered where you've applied the eyeshadow that shows you that you need to bring it up higher you need to bring the eyeshadow up onto the hood of the eye so that it's visible and that you can see it and then you need to blend it out from there so that's what I've done I've applied it up onto the hood of my eye like this and because it is a very very light talked shadow it does not require a lot of blending to make it look soft because it's soft as soon as you put it on which is the beauty of this transition color so we've just finished up using this color here now we're going to go onto this color here so as you can see this is one shade darker than this one and it is still matte and it is still neutral and now we're going to apply that to our eyes I'm just using the same at base shadow brush from Real Techniques you don't have to clean it don't worry about that and now we're going to do the exact same thing that we just did however we're not going to bring it up quite as high as our original shade so idea this is to create a kind of gradient effect so you want it to be the darkest above your lash line and then the further you get up to your eyebrows you want it to gradually lighten and that way you create a nice gradient effect and it's going to make the eyes appear a little bit rounder and more protruding which in tone is going to make a little bigger okay so I'm good all clients directly to my mobile lid and then continue in the dome shape as I bring it up onto my hood so as you can see it's darkened it a little bit but is still completely wearable for daytime or work or job interview or whatever you want this natural look for okay now it's going to get a little bit fun because we're going to darken this up just a tad so what I'm taking is this color here this is hand written from Mac you could also use in but embark from Mac because they are pretty much identical colors so that is the difference between the colors that we just used this one is a little bit dark up there now two neutrals that are on the top eyelid all right now what I'm doing is taking a tiny little detailer brush you guys know that I love these little brushes because they are so good for working shadows into the lashline so I'm taking a little bit of hand-written and I'm going to smudge it through the top lashline so close your eyes you want to gently feather this brush with the shadow on it through the roots of your lashes so you don't even need to open your eyes and look what you're doing if you can feel this is kind of rummaging through the roots that's good that's what you want the idea of this is to make the lashline appear thicker it's going to lift the eyes up by making your lashes appear thicker and in that sense make them look bigger you okay now I'm taking a black eyeliner this is the Chanel steelo you waterproof eyeliner in black so we're just taking a little bit of it and we're doing the exact same thing that we just did we're just smudging this very gently through the roots of the lashes so we're not drawing it on to the waterline or above the waterline we're not doing all means liner or anything like that we're literally just making the roots of the lashes appear darker and thicker so we've done the top eyelid for now now we're moving on to the bottom eyelid do not forget about your bottom eyelid your bottom eyelid and your top eyelid have equal parts to play in making your entire eye look bigger so I'm heading back to my neutrals palette and we're taking the original lightest transition color that we were using which was just a very very light matte top and taking again my base shadow brush from Real Techniques I'm taking a very small amount of that eyeshadow and I'm just going to sweep it underneath my lower lash line don't worry about being too precise with this just don't bring it down too low or you risk making your eyes look a bit droopy so keep it as close to the lash line as possible you here we go so you should be able to see the difference and there if I look at choose front on use I never say that if I look at you front on you can see the difference so there we go this line now has a more defined lower lid whereas this one has nothing okay now I'm going back in with my small detailing brush and hand written from Mac and I'm going to take a little bit of this on this and apply this directly underneath my lower lash line so again we're wanting to create a gradient effect so we want the darkest color to be on our lash line and gradually fade down to nothing at all you now going back in with my basic shadow brush I'm going to very gently blend that out so it's not so harsh and so that the darkest color fades into the lightest color nice and softly all righty now what I'm gonna do is take a clean tissue on my fingernail like this don't do this if you feel a little bit uncomfortable but it does help a little bit what we're going to do is apply a white in a room right now so if you've got any left over black or any eyeshadow on the inner rooms of your eyes that might actually mix with the white eyeliner and just create a murky kind of color which isn't really the look we're going for to be honest so I'm just going to clean that in a room with this clean tissue but like I said if it makes you feel uncomfortable don't do it so my inner rooms are now clean I'm going in with Sigma's unclouded eyeliner this is a white eyeliner but it's got a metallic finish to it so it really catches the light and it makes your eyes look bigger more open and more awake and I'm going to apply that to the inner rim of my lower lash line that is my white eyeliner on now it makes a difference in how big your eyes look because it makes it appear like you're in a room of the lower lash line is actually eyeball and not in a room so that's good the next step is mascara so you want to really go to town on your lashes if you have hooded eyes and you want to make them look bigger you need to really volumize your lashes so my favorite mascara of the moment is Chanel a Volume Mascara in black I'm going to apply that to my top and bottom lashes but I'm going to really build it up so that my eyelashes will open my eyes up remember eyelashes are an extension of your eye they're like little branches that grow from your eyes and bigger they are the bigger your entire eye area looks so for that reason please emphasize your lashes you all right there we go so one eye has a mascara on one doesn't and you can see how much bigger this one looks looks that's already in comparison to this puny one here okay so my mascara is on and hopefully my eyes are looking quite a bit bigger now than what they did earlier now you can stop here if you want to so you do not have to apply false lashes if you do not want to however I really like false lashes so I'm going to apply a natural pair these are from BH Cosmetics and they are very natural but they will make a slight difference in making the eyes look even bigger than they do already there we are guys so that is everything finished my eyelashes are on let me know if you found that helpful by giving me a thumbs up or a thumbs down if you didn't like it at all remember every single thing that I've used will be in the description box down below come on

        "video_sub_title": "hi this is Eric and this is episode 24 of survival medicine and today I'm going to talk about clavicle fractures well I guess it's kind of a stupid slide what is the most commonly fractured bone well you could probably guess from the title it's the collarbone or the clavicle that's the bone that connects your sternum to the chromium which is part of your shoulder blade so it's a little hook of the bone that comes around from behind and towards the front and that's your AC joint where the clavicle meets the acromion that's why it's the AC acromioclavicular joint now how do you break your clavicle typically this is landing on to a shoulder so some kind of fall that put you put your shoulder in direct contact with the ground it's very uncommon with the direct below the clavicle like a bat or something else most clavicle fractures are due to a fall landing onto a shoulder so this past weekend I was playing on a soccer game and one of the guys on the opposing team did exactly that he was running alongside a guy their feet kind of got tangled and he fell onto his left shoulder leading to a clavicle fracture if you happen to get x-ray this is typically what you'll see breaking the bone and but before we talk about surgery how can you tell you have a clavicle fracture well if you take your finger and you run from either the shoulder towards the sternum or from the sternum towards the shoulder you'll feel basically a disconnect on the bone and it's usually good to start on the good side and run your finger along the clavicle on the good side first so you kind of know the contour the clavicle for that particular person what it feels like and then go to the injured side realizing if you press too hard you're going to cause a lot of pain so which one's of these fractures do we need to have surgery well if the clavicle is just smashed into a bunch of tiny little pieces something that we call a comminuted fracture that's will sometimes require surgery if excuse me at the the clavicle is broken and the bone pieces are overlapping so much that the distance between the sternum and the shoulder is significantly shortened on the injured side compared to the non injured side that may require surgery as well if part of the bone is sticking through the skin or there's a laceration or cut even if there's not a bone sticking through but I'll cut right over the where the fracture was that definitely needs surgery you need to go in there and wash that out very carefully to prevent bone infection if there's any numbness in the arm that makes your concern for injury to one of the major nerves or if you have a pulse difference or a very pale arm you might be considered or be considered of a vascular injury and injury to one of the arteries or great vessels sometimes if there's a fracture way out distally so distal means away from the center part of the body so a fracture way out on the edge close to the AC joint that interferes with a function that AC joint may require surgery as well and finally if the bone is broken and doesn't heal within about three to six months sometimes you'll have to go in and put a plate and to get that fixed that's called a non-union but most clavicle fractures do not meet any of these six criteria and they're just handled by a sling so what can you do well you can if you happen to have a triangular bandage in your first-aid kit which I recommend you have one you can use a triangular bandage to make a quick sling it here's a picture that kind of shows you how you would wrap around the arm and then you can use a little back piece - safety pin to it the front to close at the elbow and the strap around the body is entirely optional and but this will get you a quick and easy sling in the field the other thing you can do is if you have safety pins you can use the shirt of the person - safety pin it up to form a sling now this will buy you some time but the thing that we mostly use out of the emergency room is a Velcro splint and no I did not pick the picture because it's a female this is about the only good picture I can get for this type of velcro sling and but it's got a Velcro one at the at the wrist and then one at the right above the elbow and that it helps immobilize the shoulder that's what you want to do you want to keep have from having to move the shoulder around so you want to keep the arm still and close to the body and that's basically what you do to immobilize the clavicles and the older times we would sometimes use what is called a figure-of-eight splint and so you can imagine it's a thin splint that goes around both shoulders it kind of keeps you keeps pulling your shoulders back but basically the body can fatigue and the shoulders can slump forward and it doesn't really help immobilize the clavicle very much the other thing you want to do is help control the pain if you've got some pain medicine that's probably worth taking because these can be very uncomfortable especially at night when you're sleeping or rolling around and so you want something with a little bit of kick like some hydrocodone if you don't have access to that then I would grab some tylenol ibuprofen or aspirin and take this to try and alleviate the pain again my first aid kit I've got tylenol and ibuprofen so that we can put a sling on this using a triangular bandage safety pin it up get on some pain medicine right away to help now most of these will heal without any intervention whatsoever you don't have to do anything crazy just immobilize the arm for about six to eight weeks and it will typically heal within that time now it may heal with a big bump and you can still feel kind of an abnormal contour of the broken clavicle compared to the normal clavicle and that may exist for years and years or life even but as long as the bone heals solidly that's kind of what we worry about and that's it for clavicle fractures the most commonly fractured bone in the body so it's good to have a triangular bandage it's good to have some pain medicine it's good to have a first aid kit with you thanks",

        "video_sub_title": "Vassar here here too so far as layout design and get us a nice section two here all right cool all right for this part um you're just gonna want to get your jigsaw and your wood cutting bit and make sure you have a good strong clamp so your workpiece doesn't go flying or anything and I just slowly take your time I just cut out the design doesn't have to be perfect because we're gonna be sanding it down later and yeah I just I get the rough outline and cut out so that's what we're doing right now all right sweet so after you're done cutting out your design of your long board with the jigsaw this is what it should look like just a rough outline of the long board okay guys salamandra worked off here and as you can see we finished cutting out the board it looks really nice except for this pink on one side so yeah so we're just going to get rid of that die real quickly with a little belt sander as you can see here and we're just going to start rounding out the edges and making it really nice so let's go so basically in this whole part of the process it's really easy you're just gonna want to work all the edges that you can see of the long board just to make them pretty flat and but we're going to be running them out later so just basically get all the really rough stuff off and continue from there if you've gone this far in the making of the long board you're probably wondering what I'm doing with the pencil and what I'm basically doing I've measured it saw the very exact middle of the board I and then I've measured half of that so basically I've marked out where that where the high middle point of the board is and then the quarter mark of that and then the quarter mark of the next one and basically what you're doing for this part they're just basically singing out all the paint or whatever slivers you have on the board and so that's what I'm doing its part by two all right so once you're done with the sanding down of the paint on the board and all the rough spots and also on the sides and so now you're just going to want to start doubling all of the sides of the long board and make sure you don't bevel the the sides on the top of them along toward because that's where we're gonna put the grip tape later but just bevel the sides on the bottom and then so just work on doing that with a handheld belt sander and you're good hey guys so as you can see I'm done sanding actually no I'm not I'm sanding yet but I've sanded down this too pretty fine great really smooth nice and I'm just putting these caliber trucks either the 50 Cal calibers and with some a some Arbor sucrose initiative wheels pretty nice for cruising and stuff but you know just yeah it's overall I have my other truck right over there but this is pretty smooth this is gonna be the side that we're gonna be standing on and so yeah let's get to it on the night I'm just gonna stand over to the other side first and then we're gonna work on staining and then I'll poly coat to finish up so yeah that's where we are right now so let's get to it hey guys salamander workshop here so I've just been gone I just got the sanding disc wheel and the angle grinder there and I've been just working on the micro drops here or like the little wheel divots they just kind of add a little bit of class to your board if you want that so and then I also I've been beveling out the back one's a little bit bigger they're very nice everything is really smooth this point at least on the bottom and then also I've marked out the middle point on the board I don't know if you can see that right there but I'm not marked out the middle point and then I put the trucks and basically the wheels and everything on there and then I drew where the little holes were and yeah that's where those trucks are gonna be screwed into place and then I also did that up here it's kind of faint but just like right there and right there and how you do that is if you get the point right there and then the point right there and then you draw just get something like a ruler or anything straight and just draw a line down there and then you're good to go so I think we're ready to move on to the next step and that is basically the bottom of the board is finished actually not finished but pretty much nice at this point and then so now we're gonna move this side which is the side that isn't very nice and but we're going to be sanding all this down getting all this nasty stuff off and we're gonna be adding some grip tape to it so yeah let's get started on that so in this part of the process I'm basically just put a really fine or high grit sandpaper on my hand belt sander I flipped upside down and I clamped it make sure you clamp it and then also I put on my hearing protection eye protection and I'm just really just doing up the final touches on the board so just making it really smooth before we put on the the natural hardwood stain and also the poly coat so that's what I'm doing in this step all right see so if you made it it's part of the process you're probably wondering what I'm doing right now and basically what I have is some natural fast drying natural stain and protector basically and this will just protect the wood from any like other kind of stains that you don't want and it'll just protect the wood from water okay anything in general and then so that's what I'm doing right here as you can see and so you're just gonna want to apply with a brush and or I guess you can spray it but I just use a brush and just get a light coat or just apply heavily and then I'll wipe it off with a paper towel and then let it dry before you put on the poly coat and then after you let it dry you're good to move on to the next step which is the pollak oh right so this is basically the general idea and look your board should have if you're doing it the way I am showing you how to do it it should have a nice natural stain to it and should have kind of a darker hue to it and it should be fairly smooth so if you've gotten this far you may see that I have done in a poly coat you just basically follow the same steps as applying the stain and used it without on both sides and you're just gonna want to apply that pretty heavily and for this I'm just drilling with a 3/16 eye we've inch drill bit and I'm just tightening them down and this is just a cruiser board so the bushings don't really have to be that tight and they can be probably really loose and that will probably be better for turns and stuff and so yeah awesome so we're done this to that step and we're pretty much done at this point oh my gosh yes finally we finally finished okay so here's the end result of our work so we out of a nice stain board with a poly coat finished Klerk up some awesome wheels awesome trucks of course you can use anything you want but I only suggest caliber we've got some amazing amazing micro drops here just look at that board oh it is so nice and it is time for a test ride so let's go hey guys so this is this the final test ride of the longsword and as you can see here yeah so that's a longboard hope you enjoyed this video hey guys Snell and a workshop part and so this is the finished product it has nice micro drops right there in there and also under there in there and yeah the board rides very nicely in my opinion I if I had to do it over again the only thing I'd change would be I make it with a little bit thicker plywood because it's just really flexible and if any one heavier than me got onto this board I kind of worried the food break or not so and I'm about the 110 pounds so yeah this has been a very fun project building you know living with you guys and if you like this video please like comment or subscribe and you have

        "video_sub_title": "Daily brushing and flossing will help to reduce your chances of tooth decay but there is the dental material that can be placed on the chewing surface of your tooth to help seal out back and acids before they form a cavity. The material is known as a dental sealant and it is a layer of thin plastic which is painted onto the outside of the tooth. The sealant acts as a barrier to prevent cavities from forming the procedure is painless and takes just a few minutes in your dentist's office. For the most common type of sealant, your dentist will clean and dry the tooth. Then they place a gel on your tooth chewing surface. The gel prepares the surface of the tooth and the sealant once the gel has been rinsed off and the tooth has been dried your dentist will place the liquid plastic material in the grooves of your tooth. A special blue light will harden the plastic. Plastic forms the sealant. Anyone can get a sealant including adults but children and teenagers are often the best candidates in the earlier you can place this protective barrier on the surface of your tooth the less likely you are to develop a cavity. What's great about dental sealants is that they are safe cost-effective and they hold up well under the force of normal chewing. During your regular dental visit your dentist will check the condition of the ceilings and can reapply them when needed. Sealants will often lasts for several years before they need to be reapplied. You'll still need to brush and floss but feelings give you extra protection against cavities. To learn more about taking care of your teeth and gums visit mouthhealthy.org.",

        "video_title": "Conditions that Masquerade as High Hamstring Tendinopathy",
        "video_sub_title": "[Music] hi guys i thought it would be worth making a video about conditions that can masquerade as higher hamstring tendinopathy because it's such difficult condition to properly diagnose and often people will carry on with months and months and months of failed rehab without questioning their diagnosis so it's really useful to know that there are other things that you can be thinking of and that should be excluded so for those of you who don't know me my name is mareka i'm one of the physiotherapists from sportsinjuryphysio.com where you can get online physiotherapy assessment as well as treatment of your injuries have a look at the description of this video if you want a link to our website okay so by masquerading i mean what conditions can give you exactly the same symptoms act in pretty much a similar way as a high hamstring tendinopathy and if you're not sure what a hamstring tendinopathy is i'll put a link in this video so that you can have a look at the other videos i made about it but basically it gives you pain around your sit bone and it's very painful to sit on um also running and walking and things like that can be painful to do now some high hamstring tendinopathies can also cause irritation of the sciatic nerve so that can muddy the waters a little bit so you can have symptoms down the leg but you can also just have symptoms to the knee so and i've had a few patients who's had symptoms into their bum quite often actually the glutes get irritated when the high hamstring tendon is sore as well but i'm going to take you through a series of different things that can give very similar symptoms to these and then at the end i'm going to explain to you when is it useful to start looking for answers with regards to your diagnosis and how can you make sure that your diagnosis is actually correct okay so the first thing is inflammatory conditions i thought we'd get it out of the way because it's one of the easier ones so there are certain arthritis type or autoimmune type reactions that can cause very similar symptoms because it can cause severe inflammation and irritation of that in these i can never say that where the tendon attaches into the bone so a few that comes to mind is rheumatoid arthritis psoriatic arthritis managed to say that this time um what else is there uh it's all gone out of my head but anything that has like a autoimmune dysfunction to it as well so if you've got other signs that's not been vaguely diagnosed because some of these autoimmune reactions people can't put you the docs often can't put you in a clear box for it but you have random things joints that flare up and things so if you've not been diagnosed if you have other joints that are sore that's flaring up for no reason you wake up in the morning with other joints and and tendons and stuff also feeling sore it's definitely worth having a chat with your doctor and just having them do a blood test to see if your inflammatory markers and things in your blood is up because if it is then it's worth treating that at the same time as your high hamstring tendinopathy because i've had patients with actually didn't improve because it was that inflammatory reaction because a normal high hamstring tendinopathy doesn't have inflammation in it but if you've got our inflammatory arthritis type background that can mimic the same so if you don't treat that arthritis component then the tendinopathy doesn't get better either okay so then the second one is not really something that can masquerade but it can definitely heavily contribute to why you get it and why your symptoms aren't resolving that quickly and that's if you've used fluoroquinolone antibiotics in the last six months during a year now it's a very specific type antibiotic and one of the most um common ones that's prescribed especially in the usa it seems is cipro um these type of antibiotics works really well because um they're really effective for a lot of bugs out there on germs out there but they should really be used as a last range of antibiotic if nothing else will work or you've got a serious infection but the problem is that doctors give them out way too easily because they work so well and they are detrimental for tendon health the what the research is showing is that even just one dose of that antibiotic can already cause you tendon symptoms and people have reported tendon injuries up to six months after taking the last dose and the reason that they affect it that much is that it stops the collagen turnover process so where our bodies naturally have to replace damaged cells in all our parts of our body on a daily basis especially if you're doing exercise when you take these antibiotics they prevent your tendons from regenerating themselves so you're getting a cumulative breakdown so you may want to chat to somebody who can advise you about how to go about your exercise program because it has to be a little bit slower if you're taking fluoroquinolon antibiotics or you've recently taken them because with in the first six months it seems that your turnover your collagen is affected then okay then let's get to conditions that sends similar symptoms as well the easiest one is your lower back your lower back can refer pain into it and it can do it in two ways it can either just refer pain into the sit bone area or that high hamstring area that's quite sharp and it can be quite sharp on sitting and it can be sharp with walking it doesn't have to feel like sciatic type pain it can be very localized um it doesn't have to go down the leg the leg the lower back there are different structures in there that can refer pain into that area then definitely sciatica type pain so if you're having psychotic symptoms so pins and needles funny sensations pain in your big toe things like that in your leg as well and the pain is referring lower than the than the knee it's definitely worth thinking about the sciatic nerve and whether this is a true high hamstring tendinopathy or whether it's actually more sciatica or maybe a combination of the two that needs to be treated together so that's something to keep in mind um then your sacroiliac joint so that's the big if you look at the pelvis you've got your sacrum and then you've got the two i'm going to call them hip bones but they're not really hip bones they're ilium um kind of like butterflies on the side and that big joint between the sacrum and those iliums are your sacroiliac joints and when they are tender and sore and injured again they can refer pain into that sit bone because when you sit the pressure on the sit bone affects the sacroiliac joint as well because it's upwards pressure then on that joint so that can be something that can be contributing and especially if you have symptoms like when you swing your leg out of the car or you turn over at night and you get a stinging pain in the back there that those can be signs that the sacroiliac joint is not happy with life the srj is notoriously difficult to diagnose and there's not one diagnostic test that we can do in clinic to really say it is that if eventually it becomes a high level of suspicion that it is then doing a diagnostic injection into the sacroiliac joint and seeing how it affects things is usually the best way to kind of establish whether it's it is or not but i'll explain to you in a minute when you should start thinking about that then any injury or irritation of the gluteal muscles so peripheral muscle any of the other glute muscles the deep gluteal muscles they can refer pain into that area as well so and it can feel very similar and often like i said you can have a combination of the two that the high hamstrings irritating the glutes and then the glutes irritate the hamstrings so it can be a awful feedback system there um so that's something to keep in mind then also uh high hamstring tear so i've had a few people being diagnosed only as um i am strong tendinopathy but actually if you listen to their onset of pain they were pretty okay but then they had a sudden sharp moment where the pain started while running all while jumping and since then it's been really really painful and quite often if you scan those people you'll see that actually they've got a good old tear in that high hamstring now it doesn't mean you need surgery it just means that they often need a little bit of a gentler approach to allow that to settle as well especially at the start of it yeah so that's something to think about now i've told you about all of these different things what can you do to know that your diagnosis is correct do you need a scan immediately what injections do you need everything like that well to be honest the first step is go and see or consult somebody who is experienced in this condition so you do not need a scan immediately if you see a clinician who'll properly listen to your history of how it started listen to the symptoms you're experiencing because that really explains those two things already creates the highest suspicion of what's going on here because you need to marry up how it started plus the symptoms you're feeling plus then making the patient do some movements and things to test to see what hurts it you've got to marry up all three elements of that to get to the diagnosis of high hamstring tendinopathy it's not enough to just have pain in that area the rest has to fit as well because there are very specific symptoms that makes it a higher suspicion of the lower back maybe being the issue or the sacroiliac joint being the issue versus just the higher hamstring tendon being the issue so the key is to see the correct type of clinician now you may have diagnosis of this is also not that simple so on that level that's enough to start a rehab program if they are sure that i create high suspicion high hamstring tendinopathy but then you want to see some results within your first four to six weeks so if you get to six weeks on the rehab and you look back and you're having this thing of you just can't get started because it's too painful or you're forever relapsing or you just not really progressed compared to where you started back six weeks ago now remember this is a condition that is notorious for taking a long time to get better but you want to see that there are little signs that it is moving in the right direction and your physio should be re reviewing your progress on a two weekly basis or something like that just casting an eye over it to make sure that you are progressing and it's not going to be big things it's going to be things you've got to kind of decide between you and your therapist about what are you gonna monitor what's the most useful sitting is always the last thing that becomes um comfortable so i tend to we take note of that but that's not the the main thing the things like day-to-day movements things that's more comfortable with that can you do more exercise than before without the pain setting in things like that so if you look back after six weeks and you've not really made progress then that's time to start thinking about further investigations because you're not reacting as you expected to react um and then it's really useful to go back to either the doc you saw or the clinician you were seeing well if you hopefully you're still in contact with your physio at that point and that you guys just have sit and i think and i sit down and decide okay what's the next step from here if you've just been seeing the physio should you go and see a sports physician who can then actually assess you as well and order the right type of scans for you because you've got a wide variety of scans that can be utilized now if the scan comes back and it is clear then so there are two parts here not all scans shows up uh high hamstring tendinopathy because it depends on the position you're in it it can also depend on the on the um how good the person who reads the scan is at interpreting scans but if your scan came back and it was clear it didn't show anything and your symptoms persist despite trying the rehab for at least six weeks there's no improvement then people need to investigate further it's not okay for them to just say oh no but you're testing positive with your physical tests if they've not looked at the lower back and they've not investigated the obvious things that could be contributing to those symptoms um so yeah that's the thing with scans definitely so if they scan your high hamstring tendons and there's no sign of tendinopathy they have to look up they have to look at okay is the sacroiliac joint the problem is the back a problem and really exclude those things for you let me just make sure i'm not forgetting anything um yeah so actually to just summarize that um there are loads of things that can be causing the same symptoms but if you see a skilled clinician they should be able to exclude those things through the interview that they have with you and the tests they make you do in the clinic it's not necessary to go for a scan immediately you can start rehab without a scan it's useful to have a scan at that point because if it does show it up you're more likely that it is truly that but remember you can also have that it shows up but it's not actually the cause of your symptoms so regardless of what that scan at the beginning shows if six weeks later you haven't really progressed with your rehab you've had you can't see progress in your day-to-day activities then it's worth revisiting the diagnosis and just thinking should we be looking at other things that can be contributing to this and definitely if the scan comes back clear then don't just accept that but maybe get a second opinion and if you have a high suspicion of your lower back being part of the issue go see somebody who specializes in lower backs because they are often better at reading scans of lower backs and also contributing different symptoms to that area so make sure you see the right specialist in the right areas if you start doubting your diagnosis excellent hope this was useful let me know if you've got any questions but if you need more help with an injury you're always welcome to consult one of us via video call link to the website is in the

        "video_sub_title": "in this lesson we're going to look at the nursing mnemonic demyelination and the reason we're going to look at it is because it's gonna help you figure out what symptoms patient with multiple sclerosis may have now remember multiple sclerosis it's an autoimmune disease and it causes that demyelination of the nerves the myelin sheath is that covering on the outside of the nerves and ms actually causes this this covering to a road or demon it acts isn't like an insulation so that insulation actually goes away so what we're gonna do is we're going to use this mnemonic to look for the common symptoms of multiple sclerosis so the first D in demyelination stands for diplopia it could be double vision East and for eye movement and that eye movement can actually be painful in patients with multiple sclerosis next is motor this can be motor weakness or spasticity meaning that every time a patient moves they may feel a bit or they may have muscle spasms or they're actually weak why stands for it nystagmus so anytime you have a patient that has multiple sclerosis they may exhibit the sign of nystagmus which is the basic eye movement where it goes back and forth east ANSF or elevated temperature some patients will have a baseline elevation in their temperature that may seem like a fever but it just doesn't get better so anytime you see that be suspicious that multiple sclerosis may be going on especially if they have these multitudes of symptoms the next one is ell and it stands for low meets phenomenon and what that is is every now and then patients with multiple sclerosis can get this sudden sensation that they're being shocked it can actually start at the neck or can be in the UM it can be actually in the legs so anytime you have a patient that experienced this be suspicious that they may have multiple sclerosis in stands for neuropathic pain now neuropathic pain is very very different than any other types of pain oftentimes it feels like this burning sensation so sometimes you can have patients that just they report this feel like this burning shocking feeling that's going throughout their entire body this may be a sign that your patient is exhibiting a symptom of multiple sclerosis a stands for a taxi 'm patients with multiple sclerosis can sometimes feel a toxic or they feel like they're about to fall over or they feel on study that may be a sign that you need to investigate further T stands for talking slurred so anytime a patient has slurred speech be suspicious that it may have multiple sclerosis especially if it's accompanied by any one of these other symptoms i stands for impotence in male patients be suspicious that they may have some sort of nerve conduction issue going on if they're reporting that they're having problems with impotence o sins for overactive bladder remember there's a lot of sensation going on in terms of nerve conduction and that's getting messed up because that insulation around all those nerves are being attacked and destroyed so anytime a patient reports that they have an overactive bladder they feel like I have to go to the bathroom all the time that may be an indication that they have multiple sclerosis in stands for numbness now anytime a patient has multiple sclerosis remember those nerves are getting their nerve pathways are getting messed up because they're all there's the immune system is attacking itself so what we have to do is we have to be able to look out for numbness so patients that report numbness and their hands or their fingers or even their feet or anywhere else take that into consideration when you're looking at any of the other signs or symptoms that they may have subscribe and click the little bell so you can be notified when our next nursing mnemonics video comes out click the little box below for your free cheat sheet and did you know we have a free nursing mnemonics course click the link of the description below and you can take that course for free happy nursing [Music]",

        "video_sub_title": "welcome back Ian Harvey here such a therapist you can see my eyes was never down there if you want to skip straight to the ice massage you can click up there and also consider subscribing or maybe check out my blog you know whatever today we're going to talk about what to do if you are hurt heaven forbid so when people get a backache they get a neck ache they take an impact to their knees something like that a lot of people flock to using heat heating pads things like that because it feels nice and it does have an analgesic effect but heat isn't always the right answer and that tends to be our cure-all for anything that hurts heat increases inflammation it increases blood supply when there's already planning blood supply and plenty of inflammation if you've got plantar fasciitis for instance or if you've got tennis elbow you already have plenty of blood flow to that area it's already plenty angry and it doesn't need any help from heat so if you do use heat I recommend using ice after in fact I recommend just using ice but that just might be me and rather than just throwing a cold pack on there which is okay it's convenient that's about the only good thing I can say about it other than that it does promote community but they're cumbersome they don't get things that cold and they take forever and they're just kind of there's a train I'm going by on it's just kind of uncomfortable but there is an alternative it is ice massage and it might seem kind of crazy and I might seem kind of crazy but ice massage is fast you'll be done in five minutes it's very effective you'll find that you get the next one healing effect from this you'll get it immediate pain relief and you'll probably find that the next day you have less soreness so you know the standard protocol for any sort of injury is rice rest ice compression elevation we'll talk about compression later elevation I don't do that do you I don't do that but um ice is I think misunderstood it's given a bad rap because it can be uncomfortable but it has excellent healing properties if you want to see some examples of that check out the info section down there the description and I'll link to some things about it but let's get to the procedure it's pretty easy all of this is applying a piece of ice to the area of interest let's say I've got tennis elbow you ice the area of interest then you wipe you ice you wipe and I'm going to show you how this works this is my amazing advanced technology I learned this from Pete with rich who is white since a at Florida School of Massage very smart guy and he learned that using ice had been dabbing away the water actually increases the speed of Coleman filtration from a medical journal it's funny what you wear if you read I should read anyway um the procedure you apply the ice things get wet and cold and any wipe so the main it's less wet is less cold it's less unpleasant and you proceed on in that fashion if I have tennis elbow I'm going to work on the part that hurts this lateral aspect on my elbow right here and I'm going to work a little ways down because this is where the muscles travel and I don't know if you're following along at home that's very unlikely but if you are if you feel the area that you worked on it's already insanely cold it's already starting to get a little bit numb so right now I'm icing then I'm wanting icy white thing I know it's hard to tell the difference between what I'm doing but mostly I'm icing things for quick white and this keeps my hand from getting cold it's just Joe a good time if you need a bigger piece of ice you can freeze a Dixie cup full of water you could use you could tear off the bottom and use the top as a handle but I just like this it works well and ice packs definitely have their place if you don't have time for anything else ice packs work better than nothing they do promote cleanly but how's this for fun I'm done that's that's it that's all I needed to do I'm pretty darn um which is okay if I were having pain here it would be greatly lessened and yet I'm not in pain that wasn't a painful process like the initial second is a little a little shocking but after that is fine um and I do this on myself pretty much every day because I've got forearm issues just from working as a massage therapist but they're all something that I can handle because I do a lot of preventative stuff and I also do reactive stuff where I I sip I need to UM so consider trying out ice massage for your next injury and I think that you'll find that it's way less unpleasant than an ice pack it's way more effective than heating pad and that the results are instantaneous um there's something else I like that I'd like to show just for product placement purposes but this is something that I clearly like because I've got a huge friggin bottle of it but it's Biofreeze and I'm going to put up a link of it but it's not a replacement for ice but it's like super bengay I'm sure that you don't have that on their label anywhere but that's kind of what it is it absorbs very well it makes you stink like a medicine cabinet but whenever I use it I wake up the next day feeling better so that's something to consider um and that's it for today I'm going to be referring back to this video a lot because any time I have you do any self massage I want you to ice down afterward and this is pretty much my protocol of choice just because it's so darn effective as always tell your friends check out my blog maybe subscribe and thanks for stopping by",

        "video_title": "Attention Regulation: The Difference Between ADHD and Autism (Explaining The Neurodiversity Rainbow)",
        "video_sub_title": "- [Paul] The difference between ADHD and Autism is not always obvious from the outside. In this video I'm going to illustrate literally, with pictures, four key concepts that highlight the difference between Autism and ADHD, and explain why they often look the same on the outside, while comparing that to what's actually happening on the inside. Autism and ADHD are commonly misdiagnosed and commonly occur together. So it's important that we know what the differences are, so that we can provide the right help for the right thing. So welcome to Asperger's from the Inside. You're here with Paul and I discovered I was on the spectrum about five years ago at the age of 30. My mission with this blog is to show the world the human side of Autism, or in this case, Autism and ADHD. So to start off with, ADHD and Autism look very similar on the outside. They're both neurodevelopmental conditions. They both have hidden abilities and disabilities that are not obvious from the outside. They're both misunderstood, often. And we both struggle to be normal in the sense that we need to do things our own way to survive, often times. So the differences come because even though there are overlapping symptoms, those symptoms have different causes. So for example, if a person is easily distracted, is it because they have difficult concentrating or because the have a high attention to detail, and therefore tiny little things are very distracting? If a person interrupts regularly, is it an impulse control issue, or is it an issue with reading social cues in the moment and knowing when is appropriate to talk and when I should be listening and how to find that gap in conversation? If someone doesn't seem to listen, is it because they have difficulty concentrating, or is it a sensory processing issue where it's just hard to understand the information that's coming out of the words? Similarly with hyper-focus. Is that an impulse control issue where it's more like a hyper-distraction and hyper-stimulation, getting sucked into something that's really stimulating? Or is it a fixated concentration where I'm so stuck on this one idea that I just can't let it go because my concentration is so strong? So ADHD is a neurological difference in predominantly one area. Namely attention regulation. Autism on the other hand is a suite of neurological differences across many areas, including attention regulation as one of those areas. So neurological differences in a specific area tend to have specific names, right? So, like ADHD, dyslexia, dysgraphia. You can think of it a little bit like a rainbow. Blue is not a rainbow. Red is not a rainbow. Even blue and red together are not a rainbow. But once you've got enough colors, and it doesn't really matter which colors you have, but once you've got enough of them, the word rainbow starts to make sense. ADHD is part of the neuro-diversity rainbow. It's not just about being easily distracted, and in real life it comes with additional challenges in several areas, such as emotional regulation and working memory, just to name a few. However, from a diagnosis perspective, ADHD centers on attention, with criteria assessing inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. In contrast the diagnosis criteria for Autism focus on the social aspect. How well do you relate to your peers and do what everyone else is doing? Every difference makes it harder to fit in and be normal, which means that if you have significant differences in enough of these other areas, you'd probably also qualify for an Autism diagnosis, with or without inattention, impulsivity, or hyperactivity. So, the next thing to note is that deviation from the norm can be in any direction. Whether you're too much or not enough, you may still land in the same category, because both make you different, right? So therefore, any deviation from the neuro-typical norm is likely to add weight to an Autism diagnosis. For example, not talking at four years old? Evidence for Autism. Similarly, asking questions like, \"Daddy, why won't the other kids talk to me?\" when you're 18 months old and none of your peers, you know, are speaking in full sentences yet is also evidence of Autism. So if we look at overregulation and under-regulation, the neuro-typical in the middle can concentrate when necessary, let things go when necessary. ADHD, on the other hand, is characterized by under-regulation, difficulty focusing. Autism is often characterized by overregulation, fixating, or getting stuck, but as we mentioned earlier, Autism can actually be either, because any deviation from the neuro-typical norm adds to the evidence of an Autism diagnosis. So under-regulation looks like inattention and impulsiveness, whereas overregulation looks more like stubbornness, inflexibility, not giving up, not letting go, when you really should just let it go. So let me give you two quick examples. When I was little, I designed a large maze with a computer program. And it required me to manually calculate and enter a number code into each of several thousand cells. Each cell was one little room in this maze. It was a huge amount of work. I knew it would take hours, days, maybe even weeks of my time, all right, depending on how fast I could do this. I was not looking forward to it, but I did it anyway, because I knew there was no other way. For days I could think of nothing else and I just kept going, and kept going, until it was done. That's overregulation: an extreme ability to force myself, push myself, mentally to do things, even when I just don't wanna do it anymore and I wish it was over so I didn't have to. I just keep pushing. ADHD, on the other hand, is powered by stimulation and emotional energy. When something is fun or engaging, or when external motivation is high enough, they will move with an incredible amount of energy towards that finish line. None of this slow and steady stuff. It's more like let's put on a 16-hour dance party and no one eats or sleeps until it's done. So attention can be over or under-regulated, and both have their strengths and challenges. Finally, there's a key characteristic of virtually all Autistic people that is not necessarily found in ADHD, and that is an uneven or unusual profile of abilities. Everyone finds some things easy and some things more difficult. It's possible to get an ADHD diagnosis even if what you find easy and difficult is exactly the same as the neuro-typical population. So, hobbies might be easy and homework might be difficult, for example. The difference is the degree to which these tasks are stimulating or not. So maybe hobbies are so engaging that it's hard or impossible to stop, or maybe paperwork is so boring that it may be hard or impossible to start. So in this case the ADHD profile of abilities is not necessarily unusual. Autism on the other hand tends to have very uneven and/or unusual profile of abilities that do not reflect the neuro-typical norm. I like to call this gaps in your skillset. A person might find, say, particle physics very easy, but remembering people's names very difficult. Or they may love to perform on stage as an opera singer, but find phone calls challenging and anxiety provoking. So this is why some autistic people seem to be doing really well and have challenges that other people can't see. And it's also why a lot of us are not doing very well at all and we seem to be struggling with absolutely everything, but we actually have some incredible skills and talents as well that are not being utilized. So in conclusion, the four points from today were that Autism and ADHD often look very similar on the outside, but that the same behavior may have a different underlying cause. ADHD is a difference in one area: attention. Whereas Autism is a suite of differences over many areas that may or may not include attention. So attention can also be under-regulated or over-regulated, and too much or too little are both signs of a neurological difference. Finally, Autism has an uneven profile of abilities or gaps in my skillset, which is not necessarily found in ADHD. Thank you for watching this video. And please remember that we're all human and we're all different. If we seek first to build empathy and understand each other, we can learn to leverage our strengths, support each other's challenges, and create a world that actually celebrates the diversity of all the people in it.

        "video_title": "TUTORIAL: 5 Minute Everyday Eye Makeup \u2661",
        "video_sub_title": "hello everyone I'm really excited to share today's tutorial because for the first time in a long time I'm going to share with you a look that does not require false lashes so this is my 5-minute everyday look and it truly is a 5-minute look because it really really is super minimal so I'm going to show you the eye shadow quad that I use and I just particularly love this quad because of the shimmery peachy pink at the very top and I've also paired it with the calligraphy scribble liquid liner and now for my mascara which makes a world of a difference when you are just wearing eye shadow and a little bit of eyeliner this is the new Lancome grandiose mascara and the coolest thing about this mascara is that it has a bent wand so this is the first-ever swan neck mascara wand and this has made a huge difference in cutting down my time for my everyday routine because I'm not bumping this straight end of the wand straight into my nose bridge so whether you turn the wand or lift the wand bend the wand whatever you choose it's really easy to get to all your lashes so now without any further ado let's begin with the tutorial I'm going to begin by applying the peachy pink eyeshadow all over the lid making sure to cover from corner to corner now I'm going to take the satiny brown and place that into the outer corner of the eye placing a little bit into the crease and blending out towards the temple to smooth the transition of the colors I'm going to blend with my ring finger now that the eyes then defined I'm going to take the same brush for the highlighter shade and blend thoroughly now I'm going to use the gold eyeshadow as a highlighter for the lower lash line which will make the whites of our eyes look brighter and our eyes larger now I'm going to take a brown pencil liner to make the lashline look thicker and fuller of course and then I'm going to finish off the eyeliner with M the chiffons liquid eyeliner in black coffee and flick out just a hint for a more sweet kitten fly quietly now I'm going to try something a little different and show you to mascara licks 1 just using mascara and the other using popular mascara tricks so I recently learned that women have been using baby powder on curled lashes to act as a primer of sorts to boost up the volume of lashes so I figured I would give it a try and I topped the baby powder with some of my favorite waterproof mascaras and I actually didn't see as much clumping as I had anticipated but you'll see here that that extra step doesn't even compare to just one coat of the Lancome grandiose mascara on just my bare lashes I was pretty impressed because I used a waterproof mascara with the baby powder trick but the Lancome grandiose is not even a waterproof mascara so those are some pretty great results now I'm going to share with you a second trick that I learned recently and that's to separate the lashes and remove clumps with a safety pin or tweezer now I was a little too scared to use the safety pin just in case of poking my eye out despite having a steady hand so I used a very pointy tweezer 'men tweezer and I will say that it actually did work fairly well but it does take quite a while to separate and rake through each individual eyelash and to really remove those clumps so I would probably just use a mascara wand that can separate better I'm definitely low-maintenance when it comes to my eye lashes so as fun and funny as these tricks are I'll definitely be sticking to just mascara and my eyelash curler so I hope you enjoyed the tutorial and that it gave you some insight as to how I like to wear my makeup on the everyday and yes I really do wear em scribble liner pretty often I just love that it has a really thin applicator because my lashes grow all over the place especially on this side sometimes it's hard to get a really crisp straight line but because the M eyeliner applicator is so thin it really gets a super tight even close line to my lashes and of course I love the grandiose packaging for the Elanco mascara it just reminds me so much of a fragrance bottle just because of that ombre effect that it has with the rose in the center I just love the lucite look so maybe that's just my preference but I think that the packaging is just fabulous and as far as the wand goes it's actually more beneficial than just for grabbing each lash every time you place the wand back into the tube because of the bend it actually mixes the formula within the bottle so that you get fresh mascara every time instead of pumping as you would with a standard straight mascara tube and also it definitely stays fresher for a longer so it has benefits since it doesn't let so much air into the tube and of course it doesn't hurt that the mascara wand was designed to work with your nose and your cheeks and your forehead to make sure you could grab each lash so it just makes applying mascara much easier I never have to use more than two coats just because it gives my lashes a lot of volume so what lengthens lifts it volumizes it pretty much does it all and it's the best non waterproof mascara that I found that works for my lashes in quite a few years so I've come to absolutely love this mascara because it's so easy to remove at the end of the day it's not like I have to use a cleansing oil and rub it off like I would with my normal waterproof mascaras but if you are interested in more of these everyday likes please feel free to let me know down below in the comments and I'll try to show you different looks with different textures and perhaps next time I'll show you a completely matte look if you guys are curious so thanks so much for tuning in as always and I'll see you all very soon bye you",

        "video_sub_title": "hey guys thank you so much for joining me today I'm going to do a no makeup makeup look as you would have seen from the title obviously this is kind of the makeup look that I do on days when I just don't want to do anything special but I just want to keep myself like stay in my natural way but a little more presentable because I have like tons of flaws on my face purpose of having a no makeup makeup look is to have a very flawless skin instrument in your natural features your natural beauty but just kind of enhancing what you already have and hiding the flaws of your skin you're not using a lot of products I'm not going to go move with the bronzer and the blush and the highlighting loads of eyeshadow and winged liners and water line liners and smudges and all of that jazz and bright lipsticks that's not what this is all about this is about just being your natural self only a little better a little presentable and more beautiful so if you want to see how to get to this no makeup makeup look then keep watching this video so to get started off on our no makeup makeup look I'm using the aura flame perfecting face primer and with my clean fingers I am applying this primer all over my face I'm kind of pressing this primer into my skin so that it goes on very easily now this step is kind of important because the purpose of it no makeup makeup look is a flawless face and this found this primer is going to help the foundation to go on smoothly blend easily and stay put the whole day then I'm going to go in with my Revlon Colorstay whipped cream foundation I have reviewed this foundation on my channel and I'll put the link of that video in the description box I'm dotting it all over my face now I have tons of flaws on my face as you can obviously see that is why I need a full coverage foundation but at the same time I want it to be light wearing comfortable wearing and non greasy and this foundation is everything that I need in the foundation so whenever I go for a full coverage foundation I just close my eyes and i pick up this guy and this guy does the wonders every single time now if you do not have so many flaws on your face or you don't feel the need to wear a foundation you can go for a foundation that's lighter weight and lighter bearing or you can use your normal BB cream or CC cream but if you have flaws on your face and you're looking for a full coverage foundation I would highly recommend you guys to check the foundation out then I'm going to go in with Mac select cover-up concealer this is an orange II based concealer and I am using this to counteract the blackness from my under eye areas which I have develop eCos it's sleep deprived to me these days yeah now this orange concealer is going to help to cancel out that darkness and then when I go over with my normal concealer it's going to look perfect so I'm just using my damn Beauty Blender and the pointed tip to blend out this concealer then I'm going to go in with my Maybelline Dream Lumi touch concealer which is my normal concealer and this is the shade honey now I'm not using a ton of this product as you can see because I already have put foundation and then the maximum sealer and then this one it will be too much so I'm just using enough product to cover up my circles and you see it instantly covered up everything and brightened my under-eye area and that's kind of pretty much what we are going for then to set all of this drama we are using the Maybelline Dream matte powder I just love this product it helps the concealers to stay put it avoids them from settling into fine lines it's mattifying and it is amazeballs I'm just using it to go over my mouth and in general all over my face in dabbing motions for mascara I'm using the Maybelline colossal volume express mascara now that's the only eye product I am using and I would recommend you to use a mascara if your not going for any other eye makeup because when we don't have anything else going on on the eyes the mascara will help the eyes to look more awake more fresh and more open and kind of more put together so I'm not going for like heavy coats but I'm just covering my lashes with the mascara now for the lower lashes I'm using Maybelline big eyes mascara and obviously using the wand meant for the lower lashes and just making sure to make to coat each and every lash with the mascara for brows I'm using the Rimmel eyebrow pencil and I'm just filling in the bald spots in my brows and just giving a shape to my brows which they naturally do not have here that's the story of my life but yeah I'm just doing that to give it a little bit of shape then for brow bone highlight I'm using the Loreal infallible monos eyeshadow now I find that when I do this step even though I'm not doing any other eye makeup no eye liner no Kajal no nothing I do this step and it makes me feel more fresh awake and glowy and the face looks very nice then I'm going to go with Revlon lip butter in pink truffle and I'm dabbing it on my lips I'm not like going dragging and you know putting it completely and you can see it's a perfect my lips but better shade for me so that it hides the pigmentation of the lips but still makes it look very presentable then for a little bit of that color on our face because we have a lot of foundation going and combat going on and using Mac's which is a coral color and it's a perfect color for me when I just want to go very natural because when I blush naturally that's the color my cheeks take so I just love this blush it's matte so it doesn't even emphasize my pad pores and that is it our no makeup makeup look is complete you see how it is still me very in my very natural self but just a little better my flaws are hidden I'm looking fresh I'm looking very glowy and yet it is me so I hope you've enjoyed this tutorial and I will see you soon in my next video till then you guys take care and I love you all bye",

        "video_sub_title": "How to Get Rid of Indian Meal Moths and other Pantry Pests Speaker: Keith McCoy, Solutions Pest and Lawn Hi, I\ufffdm Keith McCoy with Solutions Pest and Lawn. Today we\ufffdre going to discuss pantry pests. In the kitchen here, we\ufffdve seen some moth activity. After doing an investigation, we found out that we\ufffdve got some Indian meal moths in the pantry. We\ufffdre going to take a look in there and see what we might be able to do to eliminate the problem. I\ufffdm in the pantry and we have positively identified our pests to be Indian meal moths. Basically what we\ufffdve been seeing is some smaller moths and they kind of fly sporadically. The egg and larva stage of the Indian meal moths usually is found in grain products, such as cereals, flour, cornmeal, noodles and things like that. Anything that you find in your pantry that\ufffds in a bag or a box, that\ufffds basically where the problem is coming from. What we want to do is remove all the boxes and bags and we just want to throw them away. Don\ufffdt waste your time going through the box or the bags and trying to look for eggs and larva stage and thinking you\ufffdre going to save the food stuff. Even if you found them in there, you wouldn\ufffdt want to keep it anyway, so just throw it away. Once we remove all of that, we\ufffdre going to continue on and remove everything out of the pantry. Then we\ufffdre going to take a damp cloth and just wipe the shelving inside here and then we\ufffdre going to dry it and then we\ufffdll be prepared and ready to apply our products. We\ufffdre ready to get started. We\ufffdre going to use Novacide, which is an aerosol product, and we\ufffdre going to use it as a spot treatment inside the pantry area and spray it in all the corners of the shelving where it meets the wall. Before we get started though, always want to think about safety first, maybe wear a pair of gloves. Also, you might want to think about wearing some sort of a protective mask as well, especially when you\ufffdre working in very tight, confined areas, such as this pantry. Let\ufffds go ahead and get started. We\ufffdre going to take it and again, we\ufffdre just going to use it as a spot treatment. As we spray through here, we\ufffdre not going to make a continuous barrier, we\ufffdre just going to kind of put maybe two or three inches of spray pattern, say every foot, two feet, and that should be enough. Basically what that\ufffds going to do, any larva stages that are crawling around on the shelf area hopefully will cross over our chemical barrier and that will kill them. After we get finished completing this pantry with the Novacide, we\ufffdre going to use some glue boards and we\ufffdll hang those from the ceiling. Give me just a second, let me finish this up and I\ufffdll show you how to use the glue board. We finished our Novacide application and we restocked our pantry with new product from the grocery store. Occasionally you still might see some adult moths flying around, so what we might want to do is put up a glue board. What we\ufffdll do is hang this from the ceiling at a height of about 6 foot off the floor. Inside the glue board, you just got that lining of glue in there and most boards will come with some sort of a pad that\ufffds actually got a pheromone on it and you\ufffdll take that pad and stick it up inside the actual board itself. That will draw the moths to it and moths get stuck inside the board. Usually a glue board will last anywhere from maybe from about 10 weeks to 12 weeks, depending on the activity. We\ufffdre going to go ahead and get this thing hung up and we\ufffdll be done. We finished up our application. Let me share with you just a couple of tips. When you go to the grocery store, just make sure that you don\ufffdt buy more than a couple of weeks worth of grain products such as cereal, flour, cornmeal, and things like that. It\ufffdll just sit around there in the pantry and that\ufffds how this whole problem got started to begin with. A couple of weeks worth of food and that\ufffds it. Also, on the glue boards, today we used it for Indian meal moths to try to reduce the adult activity in the pantry area. It can also be used for other pantry pests such as sawtooth grain beetles, drug store beetles, rice weevils, you just take the glue board and set it on the shelf and they\ufffdre drawn to it and they get stuck to it. It\ufffds a great tool to use to help minimize a lot of your pantry pest activity. For more information you can call us on our 800 number, or you can visit our website at SolutionStores.com. I\ufffdm Keith McCoy with Solutions Pest and Lawn. Ask us how, then do it yourself.",

        "video_title": "7 Simple Exercises for Shoulder Pain That Really Work (Impingement, Tendonitis, Arthritis)",
        "video_sub_title": "(trampoline squeaking) - All right, folks. Come on in. We're going live again on Facebook and YouTube. Hi. I'm Bob Schrupp, physical therapist - Brad Heineck, physical therapist. - And we're gonna have the most famous physical therapist on internet. - You know, given the course files. - Yeah Brad, we're gonna talk about seven simple exercises you can do for shoulder pain that really work. - Right. - Now this works for impingement. This works for a rotator cuff tear. Well, you know, to prevent tears. - Sure. - And it'll work for a role like a tendonitis and arthritis. - Sure. - All those things. - A lot of shoulder pain - Yeah. - going on in there. - If you are new to us, by the way, and you're watching us on the rebroadcast, I'm getting a little violent here - No kidding, Bob! - on YouTube. Please take a second to subscribe to us, to provide videos and I stay healthy fit and pain-free, and we upload every day subscription button here or here. Yeah. (laughs) He's got a skeleton arm there. And if you're not, if you're on Facebook, give us, give us some love. Give us the hearts and the like season. - Mmmm. - And if you're not on Facebook get over there. - Yeah - I mean, we're gonna be giving away. We're gonna be giving away some of these balls bread, right? - Exercise balls. - Yeah. That's coming up in a day or two here. Probably. We're going to give away three of them. They're from can-do right? - Absolutely. - I can do it, baby. Alright. - So, what are we talking about again? Oh, the shoulder. - Yeah, we're talking about in the 80% of the cases I see Brad. - Mhm-hmm. - One of the problems that, is that the upper bone here, the humerus, has moved forward in the socket a little bit. (table squeaking) - Okay. - And why has that happened? Quite often because of posture. - Right. - You know, as you're sitting like this. Look how it happens. I round forward, the muscles get tight here (table squeaking) and the shoulder gets internally rotated. - Right. - It moves forward in the socket and it tightens up and it pinches it pinches on there. - Right. So, so that ball in with your humerus over the head of the humerus is not in the socket where it's supposed to be, which can lead to impingement or pain. - Yep. - And all kinds of things from bursitis, tendonitis. All things can, you know, (table creaking) arise just from poor pasture. - Yeah. It's amazing how, how that one thing leads to all these problems. It leads to, to have tendonitis. It can lead to rotator cuff tears. - Sure. - Or it can lead to the impingement. So one, you know, test that we always show people is that if you stand up and you see how, how your thumbs oriented. If you're stand here and you're straight, the thumb should be point straight ahead. (faintly speaking) - But if you're kind of, you know, kind of rounded shoulder and maybe a little forward head posture, look how my thumbs are pointing towards each other. - Sure. But this was going on right here. - So right, we're right now across the world, people are standing up and they're seeing their thumbs are pointing towards each other, Brad. - Yeah, everyone's going like this. - So, let's start off with some exercises that are going to help correct the spread. - Okay. - So, we're going to do things that stretch it, strengthen all these things, right? (tapping skull) Yep. He agrees. All right. Let's first start off with, these are the exercises that you want to do throughout the day. If you can do them every hour, if you want. - They don't take any special equipment. You could do while - Right. - you're sitting at your chair. - So we're going to start with shoulder squeezes, Brad. We're going to start just short, squeezing your shoulder blades together. So, you can see I'm giving the front view. Brad's give me the back view. See, how he's pulling those shoulder blades together. Now, the shoulders, the blades, they provide the base for the shoulder. - Right. - They're the core of the shoulder. If the muscles that are out here aren't strong, your shoulder is going to be out of whack. The muscles of the shoulder are going to be out of whack. So, you want to make sure you're doing these. I'm always amazed, Brad, when I'm starting to get shoulder pain. I just do a couple of them. - Work on these. - And a lot of times that takes it away. - Sure. - Uh, that's the beginning part of shoulder pain. But once you're deep into it, it was going to probably take a little bit longer - Right. - than that. So, good, 10 of 15 of them. And, you know, you can do them pretty subtle. Sometimes people do this one, they go this and then they hit the road, Jack. - Sure. - Hit the road, Jack. (intercom speaking) - And that actually gets the external rotators, - Yeah. - of the rotator cuff, which is helpful. You know, if you're a therapist, you know exactly what we're talking about. - All right, next one, Brad, is a technique by Brian Mulligan. - Okay. - Again, we've showed this one many times, but you can do this with a- there's a lot of different ways you can do it. You can do it in the countertop with a chair. (chair screeching) There's a lot of different. I'm watching that one, Lonnie Lori. So, you're going to go ahead and put your hand on, on the counter top, or on the chair and I'm going to push down. So I'm pushing down. So, if the chair wasn't there, I'd be pushing down like this. And you're going to push down the whole time. And what that's helping do is push the head of that bone back into place. - Right. - So I'm pushing down, I'm pushing down. I don't ever let up. No, I'm still not letting up, Brad. - Right. - I'm not letting up, I'm going to go all the way back up again. - Yep. And if, if your chair to pay your chair. I was just about ready to hold the chair. Cause if it, it might even want a tip like that. - Yeah, that's why you may want to do it on a countertop. - Right. - This is a good - Because it's steady. - this is actually a good solid chair. - Right. - But it won't work for a lot of chairs. - Sure. - Good. It's a good point, Brad. So, I, I'd like to see doing at least five of these, Brad. - Sure. - And it should be pain-free. - Right. - If it hurts, you know, go as far as the paint will allow. If you can only go this far, fine. - Right. Good point, Bob. - And then, eventually you might be able to go further and further and, and that's going to help set that in. This one has been very helpful to a lot of people. Again, you can do this one frequently. If you want, you can do it every hour, if you want. - What I might see here with this is, you know, if you can go this high and then you do five or 10 of those and you can go up this high without pain, it's a clear indication that exercise is doing the correct thing. - You want to show the method, Brad? - Oh. (chair sliding) - The practice developed this method. This is a new method of doing that same exercise. If you have a ball, we do recommend you get one if you don't because we have a lot of videos on how to use the exercise ball for rec. Brad just did one on doing an entire program for the shoulder use - Right. - with the exercise ball. - Exactly. Bob, it's the beauty of the ball. - That's right. He loves that line. - You bet. So, what we're doing here is now I'm going to squish down into the ball. That's how you know you're gonna get it right. Cause you're squishing the ball, making a little indentation in there. Now the beauty of a ball is you could still go like you are doing. - Mhm-hmm. - Now this ball is pretty big. I would probably use a smaller ball. And that's when - Or put the ball more - Right. - more surface. (tapping ball) - Or, I could just use this small ball (ball dropping) and see, now my shoulder is lower. So this might be the one to use. But then you can see I'm doing the exact same thing, but this is the options you have with the ball, pushing down. Instead of moving your feet, we moved the ball forward while maintaining that pressure down. And it's just another way to go about - And rolls down the arm. Doesn't it, Brad? - Right. Yeah. You don't have to keep your hand and try to roll, roll your hand drawn. Sometimes my patients have a tendency and I'll let them know and just let it roll right off the forearm and then back. But again, it should, if you did it like this and it hurts and you push on the ball. No pain. Then, you know, you're on the right track and it's going to work well. - By the way, Bob, Bob and Brad have a preferred list of products that we really love. And I'll put that down below in the description in on YouTube. (electronic beeping) If you want to see it. And the ball is one of them. (electronic beeping) - Right. And that way you know you're getting a good quality ball. It's nothing that - Right. - you're not, won't be happy with. - Next one, Brad. This is an easy one. This is, this is the lazy man's exercise right here. - That's why I like. - What are you going to do if you didn't take? You can either get a foam roller. Which again, the one we really liked, this is a kind of a different one. Cause it's a little softer one. Isn't it Brad? - Yeah. The density, a little soft, which makes it more comfortable, particularly for this exercise we're going to be doing. - And that's on our preferred list also down below. But if you don't, you can just take a bunch of beach towels or towels or towels and wrap them up like this. - Yeah. - And I will duct tape them. - Yeah. - You can go ahead and you're gonna create your own little roll. (table squeaks) And I'm going to put it between the shoulder blades. - Right. - So I'm putting, yeah. Brad's, showing on him. And what that's going to do is that's just going to open things up and you know, it's the end of the day. You just lay on that and you, it just opens everything up. Strips the chest. Gets the shoulders in the right position and you can just lay there. And this is a good way to unwind at the end of the day, isn't it, Brad? - Right. And this is, this is the beauty of gravity because the gravity is doing the work. You're tired. You don't want to think about something, you know, stressful. You just relax. Let the shoulders go down where they're supposed to let the joint that the humeral head corresponds to and relax. - Yeah. And this is good for (indistinct) syndrome too. - Oh yeah. - That's a, almost a must do for that one. You can show on that real quick, Brad. - Well, the thing about the rollers, you see equipment longer than this and it actually, I find it more comfortable than this. You know, that works well. I think that you're better putting in the extra, you know. You have to purchase on the other way or you don't have to it. It'll still be okay. (woman faintly speaking) Just play on here and just relax. And this does a little bit of balance issues too. It's not hard to balance. And you know, that's incorporated. - It really stretches everything out. - Yeah. And also, I like this because you can put your head on here. So it also works on posture out the neck itself, you know? So I'm actually can do some chin tucks. - Yeah. Some people are actually going to probably be, can get their head down there, Brad. - Yeah. If that's a problem, then you may need to put a pillow there. So it's called. - They also have this little device - Yeah. - that they send along with it. - The pro roller arch. Yeah. - That's nice. - Are you following advice? So, and you would only use that if this is uncomfortable. But with this, you could still do chin tucks. I'm just gonna move forward and move my body now. Ooo I just cavitated, Bob. - That means he's cracked his back. So, let's move on, Brad. - Oh, sorry! - You was getting a little comfortable there. (roller squeaking) - Next one. Now the next exercises, Brad. Are, one, you will not do all these in the same day. - Right. - You're going to pick one. And if that one starts going well, you go to the next one. So you start off with this one with his shoulder extension. So you're gonna, you're gonna need a broomstick or some type of handle, a yard stick, something like that. - A cane. Mhm-hmm. - And you're gonna start and you're going to be working on this. This thumb is going to be on the top side and you can just going to grab the end like this. (table squeaks) - Yup. - And you're gonna work on extension like this. And again, this should be pain-free. So, if you can only go this far, that's where you start. - Sure. - You don't go any further until, but eventually when you can do this to the point where it goes way back, then you'll progress to the next exercise. - Right. And if you look at me from this profile, it's going behind you, not out like this. So, that's important that we, it is an extension. We call this abduction when it moves to the side. - If you're at work, you can put your hand on a countertop and bend down like this and stretch back like this. It's a little bit difficult, but it does feel. It works in a pinch. - Yeah. - If you can see Brad over here on this one, - The countertop actually what I'll do is just to make it a little bit higher. I'm going to put that there (styrofoam squeaking) and there that I don't have to squat very far and I still can get to the point where I get that, that stretch. - By the way, as we do with all these live videos this week, we try to get through our program first and then we start answering questions. - Sure. - So, we'll do the, that at the end. Next one is shoulder. So once that one is going well, then you're going to do a shoulder internal rotation. And there's a lot of different ways you can do this. One, you can just take your, your broomstick and go over the top like this. And you're gonna grab down below. And that's kind of a tough one to do, Brad. - Yep, but once you get a hold of it, you're gonna pull off. - Because a lot of you are not going to be able to go any further than this. - Right. Cause you're, if you're going do this, you probably don't have a good shoulder. That's still good to me. - So you can shake a rolled sheet. We're going to give you lots of options here. I hope you hear me cause I'm turning away from the microphone. - Oh yeah. - but Brad's showing this is a nice device. It's called the stretch-out strap. It's on our preferred list, also. But you can take a towel and throw it over your shoulder like this and this works really good, too. You just pull up and you're gonna again, work your way up. Further and further. (woman speaking in background) - Do that again, Bob. I just want to point out one reason why that stretch off strap works quick because he literally has to grab a hold of that towel, which inherently increases some of the tightness and you won't get as good as a stretch because you can't relax as well. - So he's got a loop here that helps pull it up. Now you do this with your belt sometimes too. - Yep. - So do you want me to show? - I don't know, Brad. I don't want to take any chances here, so. (laughs) So eventually now you'll find usually your, your sore shoulder will probably go up maybe this far. Where your good shoulder - Right. - is up this far. So eventually once you're (woman laughing) about up to that, then you're ready for the next one. - And now just one particular goal. Put, if you start getting sharp pain, you need to stop. It's not ready for it yet. We just need to stretch it out gently. It should be reasonably, just a stretch, a gentle stretch. - Aright, the next one Brad is once, once that one's going well now you're, you're going to start playing this laying down. You can take your cane and your broomstick, (table creaking) and you're gonna start working on these. go on straight forward like this. And you want, you can use the one arm can help the other arm, Brad. - Sure. - And I'm just going further and further like this. - If you don't want to have a cane or broomstick you and just go to a hardware store and pick up a piece of PVC pipe for $2. - Sure. - That's we use here and that, (table creaking) that works really well. - And then the final one, Brad, is you're gonna go ahead and you're gonna go ahead up to the wall and you're going to either with a ball - Yeah! - Or you can do it with a towel. - Sure. - So Brad's going to show this to get the skeleton out of the way. (table creaks) (wheels sliding) Sorry. I gotta move this camera around here to the kitchen, Brad. - Yep. - There we go. - So, you know, hopefully your walls a little bit on the slippery side. You can just take a towel and then just go up. If you need to help with this hand a little bit and you're just going to help bring it up and down, bring it up through the tills, stretch. Any sharp pain you're, it's too early. You don't want to push into sharp pain, you're going to make it worse. Up until you feel a stretch, maybe a little mild stretch pain, then come back down and as time goes on, day by day, you'll get stronger and they'll stretch out and they'll work out well. Particularly, if you did those other exercises first, you can use the ball. (ball bounces) I like this because you can use both hands. So, this will be my good hand. I'm going to put it on top of my week one and it's going to assist. So that it makes it easier and as the weak one gets stronger, then I take that one off and I got to work it up just as far as tolerated, we're not going to push in the sharp pain to make it sore. We're just going to gently work it. Gently strengthen it and you can roll up or if it feels good and it feels like a good stretch. When you get up in here, you can roll right up your forearm towards your elbow. (woman talking) And that works out real well. All right. - All right, Brad. Someone ask us if we have an Amazon preferred list and that's what I was talking about. Yes we do. And that's, I don't know if it's linked below yet. I'll make sure it's there by tonight, but that is our preferred list of products and that's, that was a good question. - Sure. - So, and then someone was talking, I didn't catch the string of conversation, but they were used to...remember we did a video on using those pool noodles? I think we were using them as a back support. - Right. - But they were, they were using it at night in the bed. - Oh, for lumber support? - Yeah. - Sure. - So, by the way, we can show real quickly Lonnie, if you want to throw me a couple of pillows and I grabbed a couple of pillows. You know, our recommended sleeping posture is one that you don't sleep on. You know, if you have a painful shoulder, don't sleep on it. - Right. - If you have to, if you feel like you can't sleep any other way, we recommend you put the two pillows like this and you put a third pillow or a smaller pillow right here. And you create the groove here or the canal. And now you've got room for that shoulder to give it some relief. If that doesn't work or if you can sleep on the other side, the side that doesn't, it isn't harmful. You'd want two pillows underneath your head cause you'd need lots of pillows and you'd have two pillows underneath your head. You'd take one pillow here and one pillow here. And that gives that arm support all night long. It's really important with shoulder pain to keep that shoulder supported all the time. Even when you're sitting, I'd like to take it. I tell people to take a couple pillows and put it like this and let that shoulder relax and rest. Lonnie, did you have a question? - [Lonnie] Is that good for preventing frozen shoulder, too? - Frozen shoulder is a weird phenomenon. Lonnie said, the question from Facebook is, will this prevent frozen shoulder. Frozen shoulder, they don't really understand why it crops up. It's just, it's an inflammatory process. - Mhm-hmm - I don't know that you can really prevent it. Sometimes it happens after injury. - Right. - And, and sometimes it just happens sporadically. - Sure. - And, and unfortunately the frozen shoulder, it lasts a certain amount of time no matter what you do. You can make it a little less extreme, but it, it's gonna run its course. - Right. - It's got the freezing stage, the unfreezing stage. So. - And we do have a video on the exercises that you can do to help manage it. - Yeah. Did you have a question, Brad? - I, yeah. We had a gentleman ask about, can some of these done, be done from a wheelchair and others that can't stand up. Someone was in the wheelchair. - Well, absolutely! - So, I don't have a wheelchair handy here, but it's going to be the same thing for it - Brad, come a little more this way. - Oh, there we go. (wheelchair squeaking) Of course, sitting down for like the - Mulligan - Mulligan technique, then you probably wouldn't need to use the ball and you'd probably just need a smaller ball to put on the table. - Or you could have the ball in front of you. - Oh yeah. Right there. Let's grab it, Bob. That's a good idea. - I mean, you certainly could do the shoulder squeezes together. - Sure. - That's a, that's a really good one to do when you're in a wheelchair because wheelchair posture tends to be bad. - Sure. - So - Yeah. So, again, (wheelchair squeaking) squeezing back here and, you know, hopefully if you have supports on your wheelchair, that might make it difficult. You may have to come forward if you can, depending on your, on your problems, but you just have to imagine everything and to the different height of the chair. And the problem is the chair may get in the way in some of the exercise. If you have removable arm rest, that will help a lot to do some of these exercises so that your elbows aren't bumping in things. - And some people were saying they had no sound. I hope we got sound now. I mean, we have an indicator that we have sound. - Yeah. - [Lonnie] (crashing drowns out speaker) - For which one? - [Lonnie] Partia needs. I'm not. Lonnie's got a question there, but I'm not sure what, what she but I, I'm not sure what. Brad's going to take a look at it. I'll look over here real quick to see if there's any other questions over here. Do these exercises work with a torn labrum with no surgery required. I would try some of these with the torn labrum, but again, I'd very much avoid any painful exercises. Again, with a torn labrum. You might often have it, then it's a little bit out of socket. So you want to get it in place, but it was a torn labrum. You got to be completely guided by pain. I mean, - Right. - If I do an exercise and it hurts, you can't do it to. Keep that, that labrum mid place, let it heal up, give it some time. - It's gonna heal. - Right - Yeah. - To me, that's kind of like the meniscus of the knee. I kind of relate how - Right. Exactly. (table squeaking) - Yeah. And then that other diagnosis, that's a real select diagnosis that we'd have to, - We'd have to do a separate video on. - Yeah. - Yeah - Sorry about that. - [Lonnie] So, she does strengthening instruction. She did the everyday or every other day? - For a strengthening, you know, because these are small muscles. I mean, like let's say for example, bread, we're gonna work on one. One that we really liked for the shoulder is external rotation and you can take just a soup can and you can lay on your side. I got that pillow for my pillows. - Oh, I see. - He's taking away my pillows! So, you can lay on your side like this (table squeaking) and you can go ahead and go like this and you're working on external rotation. Now this is a small muscle. It's really good for helping keep the bone in the socket. And, but you could do these everyday because there's such small muscles. You wouldn't overwork them by, you know, you can do three sets of 10. I'll work up to three sets of 10 and you could do those every day. Definitely the stretches (table creaks) you can not only do every day, you could do them, quite often, every hour. I mean. - That's so mean it feels good and you're not - Right. - It might be some usual situation where it's making it sore, but typically you don't do them all. You don't overdo them. - Right. - Do them within reason. - The way Mackenzie recommends, you know, especially working on extension like this, starting with that one. - Sure. - He says, you can do it every hour or five days, you know, five hours or five times a day. - Sure. - So anything else? - Let's see. - [Lonnie] So here's a question - Question? - [Lonnie] from (indistinct). While playing cricket, I developed neck and back pain. I can not move my neck, the whites, right? - So. - [Lonnie] When I move my chin towards my chest, there is a sharp pain. - So a guy is, the question, he's playing cricket and he develops a back and neck pain. And now he's having some movement difficulties with his neck. - [Lonnie] Mhm-hmm. - I'm sorry, that's just too specific. I mean, first off there could be an injury there that you should probably go in and have an x-ray. So we really can't make any recommendations. There generally, with movement. We have you work on the direction that you can move. If there's nothing, you know, nothing broken. So if you can't do down and to the side, we have your work to the opposite side and keep working that. And then eventually, hopefully, that the other side comes through. So, Brad, anything? - Yeah. Someone's asking to watch the foam roller and if a half a foam roller would work. And yeah, that could work out for this. Particularly this exercise that we showed. It's even more stable and it does the same thing, so. - Yeah, I - In any case it could work well. - I use a half a foam roller myself, to be honest with you. - Oh, do you really? - Yeah. It's all I have at home. - Okay. - Cause I, but I, it is something I use every day. But yeah, I, I have a, a real like for this foam roller because it's, it's a bit softer. It's the first one I found like this, Brad. I'm up there with our other ones, but it's, it's just not quite as, as hard as the other ones. It's made by OPTP, but again, it's in our preferred list. So anything else, folks? We're happy to take your questions. We're just winding down. - There's a number of questions and some of them are a little off topic. There was one about can we can use elastic bands versus the silk kits? - Oh, of course. - Yeah. We, we use the elastic bands all the time. - I actually prefer them. - Yeah, me too. - But not everyone has them at home, but, you know, this is the same exercise that Bob was doing. - Doing external rotation. - Yeah. And so they work very well, but again, not everyone has one at home, but everyone can do this. - Right. So if you want to purchase one or, you know, if you're, if you're a PT, if you're a patient, you know, we just, you know. - We have already some stretch exercise bands. - Yeah. - All right, folks, we've been running it a long time here. We probably should cut her off. Otherwise people are going to get angry at us. So thanks everybody for watching. And please subscribe to us if you haven't already.

        "video_title": "How to use a Nebulizer Device",
        "video_sub_title": "--Introduction Music Plays-- Nebulizers are the most useful for patients with very  poor inspiratory flow rates due to severe airflow  obstruction, and for those with cognitive impairment,  difficulty with manual dexterity, or poor hand-eye  coordination. Various medications can be nebulized,  which include daily maintenance medications, as well as  those that should be taken only when needed. Let's watch as Casey describes and demonstrates to  Mrs. Ryan how to use and clean the Nebulizer. Hello Mrs. Ryan, I'm Casey. Hi, Casey.  I'm here today to show you how to use a Nebulizer that  your clinician has prescribed. This is called a set-up  for your Nebulizer. So what you're going to do is,  1st thing you're going to be using this little cup device  to put in a liquid medication that comes in an ampule  like this. Ok. So you twist off the top of the ampule,  you poor it in your little medication cup,  and you close it up. Now, you're going to put together the mouthpiece  and the T-piece together. Here's the mouthpiece,  and the T-piece. And lastly, you're going to take the hose,  and the hose is connected to a compressor.  This compressor just pushes air through. The air aerosolizes that liquid medication in the cup  to be a fine mist for you to inhale. Ok. So what we'll do is this side will go to the compressor,  and this side's going to go to the medication. Oh good, color coordinated. So, and what we'll do,  we turn the compressor on,  and now you'll see a fine mist coming out. You're going to put your mouth over the mouthpiece  and you're going to breathe normally in and out.   Just breathe normally in and out for anywhere from  5 to up to 15 minutes. Ok. Now you'll know when it's done because the medication  starts to sputter and you know it's pretty much  all finished. Oh, Ok. So when it starts to sputter  you turn off the compressor, you take it apart,  and now what you do, at the end of the day  you're going to be cleaning this part.  You don't clean the tubing, you clean this section,  so you take it apart, and you're going to be  cleaning it with water and white vinegar. Just like my coffee pot. Correct 3 parts water to 1 part  white vinegar. So you're going to clean the cup,  the mouthpiece, the T-piece and sometimes there's  corrugated tubing off to the other side as you exhale,  and you clean that piece, too. Ok. So now why don't you show me how to use  the Nebulizer and put it together. Oh boy,  you found out that I'm not mechanical, didn't you? Let's see, I'm going to put the medication into here. Correct. And then I'm going to  put the top back on  and I guess then I will, let's see. Put this. Be careful not to lean too far, or else you'd  spill out your medicine, out the top. Ok.   There, I think I got all the parts together. Good. Ok, and then the green part goes in the compressor, and the blue matches with the little medication deal. Excellent. Ok.  And then just   Excellent, breathe in and out normally.   And how do you know when the medicine's finished? It sputters. Excellent. And so now we make like a coffee pot and put it all  in water and vinegar. I have to do this every day? Yes, because what happens is we don't want bacteria  to grow in the cup or the set-up system. Ok. We want to keep that clean and ready for your medication. Ok, and I don't have to redo this,  I don't have to wash that. Correct, and about once a month  you should replace the whole system and have a whole  new system for your Nebulizer. Ok. Any questions at all? I'm glad I got your phone number. All right.",

        "video_title": "Recurrent fungal infection | causes| How to prevent",
        "video_sub_title": "hi superficial fungal infections of the skin are very common and a lot of people come to us complaining that they are getting recurrent infections that means that whenever they take medicines it goes away but as soon as they stop it comes back again or it recurs every year so in this video i'm going to tell you what measures you can take in order to prevent the recurrences of these fungal infections first and foremost important cause for recurrent of these infections is incomplete treatment if you have not completed the course of antifungals and you have stopped it midway then there's a high chance of the fungal infection coming back remember that nowadays fungal infections are very tough to treat and they have become resistant to treatment so you have to complete the course of medicines in order to see results okay so when you start taking antifungal medicines in about one to two weeks you'll feel that you've become absolutely okay and all the lesions have subsided but as soon as you stop it's just gonna come back again so you have to complete the course usually we give a course for about three to four weeks but if you have extensive infection involving multiple body areas then you'll have to take medicines for six to eight weeks we give a combination of oral antifungals as well as creams to apply oral tablets and capsules we usually give for about three to four weeks and topical application can be continued for up to three months so please always when you leave the dermats clinic understand for how long you're supposed to take the medicines how long you're supposed to apply the creams so that you do it properly okay because if you leave it midway it's just gonna come back again second most common cause for recurrence is using creams that contain steroid if you're using any cream with more than two components in it and the other component is not salicylic acid then please stop using it right now okay you are not supposed to use any creams that contain steroid in it in the description box below i'll be mentioning the commonly used topical steroids so please make sure that the antifungal cream that you're using does not have any steroid in it what steroids do is that it reduces the ability of your body to mount a reaction against the fungus okay so our body reacts to the fungus forms and inflammation and that is how it kills the fungus but if you apply a cream with steroid that reaction will not be there and the fungus will just keep spreading okay and when you start applying the steroid cream initially you will feel that it's gone away completely the lesions have subsided and you know you feel a lot of relief but as soon as you stop the cream it comes back with double the force okay so please do not use any creams with steroids in it and steroids also causes thinning of the skin if you're applying creams that contain steroids especially in areas such as the groin or under your breast then you'll notice that it's leaving behind large stretch marks you leave behind large red stretch marks which takes a long time to get better okay and remember that stretch marks once formed can never go back to normal skin so we have to make sure that we do not use any creams that contain steroids steroids will cause thinning of the skin if you apply it on your face you can even see that your facial hair is increased after application of steroid please make sure that the creams that you're using do not contain steroid in them when your lesions are very large and red and then you apply a cream that contains steroid it is just going to reduce the inflammation of the skin the redness okay so you will feel that the redness is gone and the lesion looks so much better and that you're healing but it is only causing a temporary improvement it is just going to get worse and the fungus is only going to continue to multiply so make sure that you avoid using creams that contain steroids i cannot stress this enough please stop using steroid creams in your groin area and using these combination creams antifungal combination with a steroid do not use these creams because it is just going to make matters worse and it is going to just prolong your treatment course third cause is improper hygiene so whenever you have a fungal infection you have to be very careful of your hygiene after you take a bath you have to wipe yourself properly with a thin cotton towel okay and make sure that the folds of your body are properly wiped off there is no water logging and then you can apply the anti-fungal cream make sure that this towel is washed every day and ironed every day all the clothes that come in contact with your body have to be washed and ironed every day especially your undergarments otherwise what happens is that whenever you take tablets the lesions go away but the fungus can come back to your body through towels and through undergarments so then you'll keep getting these infections again and again so make sure that all your undergarments and towels are properly ironed your clothes have to be dried out in the sun and after drying have to be ironed properly just sun drying the clothes is not going to help in killing the fungus so ironing the clothes is very very important fourth cause for recurrent fungal infection is if your family member is infected okay so fungal infection spreads very rapidly within the family especially if your clothes are washed together or you're sharing towels okay so make sure that all your towels are separate and if you do have a fungal infection your clothes have to be washed separately so if you do suffer from fungal infection do ask your family members if they are having it too especially if you have teenage boys they feel very shy to come up to their parent and tell them that they have a fungal infection you would probably just go up to a chemist and buy a cream and apply that which is just not going to help so if please ask every member in your family if they are having fungal infection what happens is that everybody's response to the fungal infection is different the family member might always have a mild infection which they'll be just applying a cream and which is not bothering them too much but until that person is treated you will continue to have this severe infection so you have to break this chain to completely recover otherwise as long as you take medicines it's going to remain fine but then as soon as you stop medicine because of reinfection you're again going to develop this fungal infection so make sure that you properly ask your family members if they are suffering from this fungal infection and if they are they should also be properly and adequately treated another common cause for recurrent infection is infection in the toenails so if your toenails are yellow in color or they are very thickened then you have to bring this to the notice of your dermatologist sometimes what happens is that because of prolonged nail infection you're continuously getting infections in the groin area you want to make sure that you're very careful while wearing your under almonds otherwise if the size of your undergarment touches the toenail then you'll keep developing lesions in the groin okay so you have to be very careful about that and also you have to treat the toenail fungal infection if you have fungal infection of the toenail you have to take treatment for about three to six months yes it's a very long treatment if your toenail is infected the toenail grows very very slowly so it requires that you take treatment for a long time for it to go away completely along with oral antifungals we also give you nail lacquer which is like a nail polish with an anti-fungal that can be applied on the nail plate every day okay so you have to be very careful when you have a toenail infection and make sure that it is treated properly so that you can reduce the recurrences of fungal infection another common cause for recurrent fungal infection is having diabetes diabetes reduces the ability of your body to fight against infections okay it kind of reduces immunity per se so what happens is that then you'll then you are more likely to develop infections again and again so if your blood sugar levels are not controlled then you really want to look into it and control them this could be one of the reasons why you're getting fungal infection so if you have if you're not a known diabetic and have extensive fungal infections and have a family history of diabetes then you really want to get your blood sugar checked you also have to be careful about food intake try to avoid food with high carbohydrate content and high level of sugar in them especially if you're diabetic or borderline diabetic this will also hamper the healing of the fungal infection so there you go a brief video on the causes for recurrence of superficial fungal infections i hope you found this video useful if you like such skin and hair related content then you can follow me on my instagram handle dr achill md i post such skin and hair related content daily

        "video_sub_title": "this tutorial will teach you how to make a PVC slide flute it's very easy to make and it doesn't take any mathematical or musical skill to build this kind of flute you need a half inch pipe and a ninety degree Bend for it and you need a one-inch pipe with a cap for it need some modeling clay a hacksaw knife a rasp and a drill so the first thing to do is cut the pipe into the proper lengths you'll probably only need about 10 inches but the smaller pipe the half inch pipe should be longer than the one-inch pipe because it fits inside the first thing to do the half inch pipe is slip the 90 degree bend over the end and find out how far it reaches because you want to drill a hole right where the border is right just as far as it reaches so that way it can slip over and direct the air into that hole I used a 1/8 inch drill bit make it wider than it is long you might have to tilt the drill bit to do that it might take a little bit of time but you can get it right with practice and that's the kind of hole you want to get that's the approximate shape next thing to do is plug up the end with modeling clay you might want to use a stick or drill bit something to shove it in there make it flat against the edge so that blocks the air completely what I did is I just put the drill bit in there and shook it up so gravity took care of it and that seals the air off so that did the job for me next thing to do is carve the air channel which is going to be a gap between the edge of the 90 degree Bend and the half-inch pipe carve this with the rasp just kind of draw it across until there's starts to be a gap you can see the gap right there it should be very narrow but still noticeable and after a gap you should start getting some air movement over the hole and you carve the hole so that the edge of it is shaped like a wedge so that it's sharp you know so that the air is directed either in or out of the hole but it has to go one way or the other now for the one-inch pipe you want to put the cap over the edge of it to seal it off because the one-inch pipe is going to hold water so after you do that just fill it up then put the smaller pipe inside to get rid of the excess and just have fun",

        "video_title": "Labral Tears Part 2: Symptoms & Evaluation",
        "video_sub_title": "- There are basically two very common types of labral tears. But the causes are very different. The first type of labral tear that's probably the most common is what we call a Bankart tear or an anterior labral tear, which occurs in the very front of the shoulder. And the most common cause of that is a shoulder dislocation, when the ball pops out of the socket, very common in football, a linebacker or a free safety that gets caught in a position with the arm in the abduction and external rotation and they get hit and their shoulder pops out the front, The ball pops out of the front of the socket. And when the ball pops out of that socket, it catches the labrum and tears the labrum off the bone as it comes out. The second most common type of tear is what's called a SLAP lesion or a superior labral tear which is a labrum on the top of the socket. That occurs more from kind of chronic repetitive overuse, such as an overhead athlete, like a pitcher or a tennis player, a javelin thrower. People with repetitive motion can have a superior labral tear. They all complain of a loss of velocity in their fastball or they just can't get the football down the field like they wanted to before. And they complain of pain kind of anterior and superiorly, whereas the anterior labral tear or a Bankart type tear, they're having typically some instability episodes. When they bring their arm up into certain positions, particularly abduction and external rotation, when they get caught in this position, sometimes even in their sleep, they'll feel the shoulder kind of give out on them or sublux. A lot of times athletes will try and get through a whole season without even telling us. Particularly linebackers, free safeties tend to be very tough individuals. And they won't even bring it up until after the season. And they'll come in and they'll say, \"You know, doc, \"my shoulder's been popping out on me all season. \"What can you do for me?\" Diagnose a labral tear, it involves basically three components. First component is history, which is, you know, when and where they're having pain or are they having instability. The second component is physical examination. We literally place our hands on the patient and kind of get a sense of how unstable their shoulder is. Sometimes we can even pop a shoulder out in the office if you're not careful, if a patient is really unstable. Specifically with a SLAP tear or a superior labral tear, a patient commonly will have pain with elevation, with the thumb down like this and slight adduction now. Do you have pain? Hold your arm up and resist me right there. Hold it, hold it. Does that cause any pain? - No. - And now with the palm up, typically they'll have pain in this position with a superior labral tear. But when you bring their palm up like this, they will have no pain. Hold it up right there. Typically we want to know, you know, what positions does their shoulder feel unstable and is it abduction, external rotation, which is classically leads to the anterior labral tear. Basically when they have pain, how much force it takes, do they have pain in the weight room, a lot of times with lifting, bench pressing, things like that, do they have a painful catching in the weight room? This is where the shoulder typically comes out the front. And we call this an apprehension test. And we bring them back as far as we can. And if they have an unstable shoulder, they will commonly stop me. They'll say, \"Doctor, stop, I feel like \"it's going to pop out.\" But Jason obviously has a negative apprehension sign. He has no sign of instability out at the front. The second test we do is what's called an inferior sulcus test. You literally, to assess if the ball is unstable in this plane inferiorly, we just lie them flat and apply a force distally. And if some people are so unstable inferiorly that they will notice a big sulcus or dent in the skin here. But he's fine. And then for anterior stability, we literally again abduction, external rotation. And we actually apply a force and see how much we can ride that ball out of the socket. But he's very stable right there. Does it feel at all like you have any instability there? - [Jason] No. - [Dr. Luchetti] So he's stable inferiorly and anteriorly, and he has a negative apprehension test right there. The third component, diagnosis, would be an MRI with contrast, which is a special type of MRI where dye is injected into the shoulder and the dye leaks up underneath the labral tear. And an MRI really is the definitive diagnosis. This is an MRI of a shoulder that illustrates a Bankart lesion, that is, a tear of the labrum in the front and below. What do I mean by that? Well, this is the ball of the sockets. Since we're looking at a cross section looking down on a cross section of the shoulder. This is the ball, and this is the shoulder blade. And on the end of the shoulder blade is the labrum. And the labrum here is indicated in a darker black. It's this area right here. The white that we see has been injected into the joint. This is a dye. And the dye is used to outline a tear in the labrum. The yellow arrow is pointing to this tear in the labrum. And I'm going to outline it just like this. So this is a torn labrum. This is a normal labrum.",

        "video_title": "Exercises for hyper-lordotic lower back and anterior tilt | Feat. Tim Keeley | No.188 | Physio REHAB",
        "video_sub_title": "all right for those of you who are a - orthotic lower back person and you get back pain when you are standing walking or running then I've got four exercises for you to do to try and sort us out now this used to be me I used to run with a hypotonic back I was very curved now you just get a lot of pain when I was running because I have really tight lower back on jamming those faster joints and at a really weak core so I hope the years are fixed that I'm gonna give you some tips to do for you if that's your scenario so first thing you ought to think about is if you're an anterior tilt like that okay a hypertonic back when you're running it's going to jam those better joints so you're gonna have tight hip flexors going to try lower back in a weak core now it's all well and good just saying okay got a neutral but a lot of people can't go to neutral because they're too tight too weak and too tight here so the first which I want you to do is your classic have fix the stretch now with a hip flexor stretch here's a few tips this one here yes you're trying to loosen up through here because if you're in an anterior tilt you're in a shortened position a lot of time of the day so if you can release that it'll give you an option to actually get into the neutral spine so that's what you have to do when you go and do the stretch when you do this don't just lunge forward alright stop that you've got to try and tilt here first okay so you get the lengthening through the front now we're not just talking hip flexor deep inside and so us we're also reckless femoris that gets a little bit down through the court so that will also be tight and that's what you're trying to stretch you out at the same time so when I'm doing this I'm activating my glute here I'm doing a posterior Drive posterior tilt there which stretches me out through here and I can feel that already gives me some activation here which is or mill automatically I'm correcting my Lord otic position okay so that point there once you've got the stretch then you can go forward but you've got to think about pushing forward through here so you're pushed forward and then you'll get the point we just I can't seem to go any further is enough pain enough stretch through there then be my guest and put on a bit of that a better rotation what have you need but don't who's this contraction here okay you can do this but don't lose that and don't lose and go into that anterior tilt all right so one or two minutes on that both sides work on that twice whew hip flexor stretch now second stretch I want to do is your curiosity cuz like I said when you're in a hyper lordotic position and you're running like this this is all jammed up all this is really short so we need to lengthen it out so for that one go into your classic QL stretch make sure being the knee all right you're not trying to stretch out your hamstring you were trying to get opening up in the slide back and flexing them in the slower back because it's been dreamed into extension for so long so reach forward into here grab onto that and when you rotate make sure that you slowly go this way get enough dry that you'll feel a little bit of stretch perhaps through there and then you've got to try and come over gosh it's sunny today gotta come over this way I open you up through here now you may just find you start feeling it in your obliques and a little bit of extensors but eventually you'll get through all that tightness it and into that QL making sure you always rotate it back rotate it over and again hold it out creep this down a little bit so there's a bit of tension here not too much and get it right through there then you can add on a bit of this as well if you want if you really want to overdo it but don't come forward now that one is really powerful for you to be able to then open up into neutral so these people are stuck in this position here to be able to do that you need flexibility there that's going to help you with it all right so those two first two are the two major muscle groups that are shortened when you're in an anterior tilt so - a Datuk so we just helped you with both those muscles now that's not all you have to do you have to work on your strengthening part and core stability now majority of the time if you're in a hot load otic this like I said is weak so we need to work on your core but pretty specifically you've got to think about if I'm standing walking or running I need my static core endurance I don't need the ability to Valdez situps I need the ability to hold my neutral spine and switch this on and keep it on for a long period of time in a neutral position because that's what I want to be when I'm running to stop my back pain so first thing you do is you're doing a knee float now this is a classic old-school Pilates but it's really important for you as - a lot of people to work on so you're going to go I'll show you this way as you try and find that neutral spine now you've loosened it up then what you're going to do as a knee float no hold the heel up so gonna talk to you is you basically hold that neutral spine there turn your core on by holding a week and if you don't know how to do that check out other videos on how to do that but you're gonna float one leg up like this now here's the training part what you got to try and do is as my leg extends outwards I'm not allowed to go into an anterior tilt so I've got to keep my neutral spine I started off with and as I extend head here I'm trying to stabilize through here and extended the hip so I'm going to extend down the hip as I get lower this is going to be hard I have to work the lower down here and go right down to us above the ground and then bring it back place it on the ground keep my core on and then swap near those swap don't shift or rock the boat swap to the other side as I love that one down same Jill Joanie yourself going to that position there because imagine that's what's happening when you're running okay when you're pushing backwards if you're got no strength here when you run when you drive through it's just doing that and so we've got to fight there and go I need to be in that position so one I'm learning the strength here alright I'm learning how to was I'm getting this drink off being in that position but I'm also learning a pattern and move it when I extend my leg I don't want my back doing that okay I've got to learn a motor pattern that takes time and time and repetitions so you'll have to spend quite a bit of time that low-level stuff don't go too hard we have tried enough two legs and put two legs out to strength because you've got to learn position and motor panting first then you build on the strength so in that regards I'm going to teach your strength from but we got to dial it back a bit so the next strength thing I want you to do I'm gonna move into the shake it's pretty hot out here as you go into a plank but I want you doing it on your knees okay in fact I might just turn this around so you can see me because if you start up on your knees you do a lot better with your position then if you start doing it on your feet all right specially if you don't leave much mini planks you need to work on this so what I like to do go down into this position here and then bring your bum forward all right so you're in this position here you've got to make sure that you're not in hypergolic okay so you're trying to change the pattern moving you need to bring yourself in a neutral by turning your buttock on and turning your core and it's simply about keeping your buttocks on and keeping your core on and just statically and getting that endurance and building up that strength so I've got to show you either standing instead of being there you've got to be here right and it's just holding that on that holding those on and most people don't do a plank with their glutes on they just leave their glutes go you need your glutes so be in this position here and turning that on and I don't mean go ridiculous and really crank it just enough to hold your neutral spine and keep those glutes activated and overtime but we're talking over a minute you'll feel though that inner core working your theory article working you'll feel those log Donald's really switching on and that's the strength thing of it but you need to start with to help you keep that neutral arm and trust me you start working on those two stretches and those two exercises do that before you have to be standing all day or before you have to go running you'll last a lot longer and your pre-fund is a lot less pain and you can actually run or stand with a bit better posture in here w Kirillov that pain alright that's enough this week see you next [Music]",

        "video_sub_title": "hey guys we're here at Neptune cigar superstore in Miami today we're going to be talking about how to properly calibrate a hygrometer now when you first get a new humidor it's very important that you test a calibration of the hygrometer in order to ensure that you're reading the proper humidity levels now most of them are going to be available in one of two fashions are there on the outside of the box or on the inside of the box now if you have one of the ones that is attached to the outside usually you can just go ahead and pop it out you know from the inside now in order to test the calibration of this hydrometer we're going to use what's commonly known as the salt method to do this get a plastic bag such as the one that the cigars you bought came in all righty Ziploc will do place the hygrometer inside next we want to take a bottle cap and add roughly two spoonfuls of regular table salt next get some water and add just a little bit to a salt careful not to put too much because then it will dissolve it and this will all be useless okay place it in the bag with the hygrometer and ensure that it is firmly sealed let it sit for 12 hours after 12 hours you want to go ahead and look at the hygrometer inside the bag to see what it is reading if it should be reading 75 if it is anything other than 75 up or down just take note of the difference and go ahead and adjust accordingly in the next step which I will show you now if there was a discrepancy between 75% and what it is actually reading you want to go ahead and take a small tool like a little screwdriver and on the back of the hygrometer there is a dial if it was a 5 percent you know discrepancy 10% discrepancy whatever it is just adjust it you know up or down as needed now there is something you can do a little helpful tip you can go ahead and buy a digital hygrometer a digital hygrometer there always proven to be a little bit more accurate and they usually come calibrated from the factory so it is a wise investment if I can say so thank you for watching if you have any more questions or if you want to see some tutorials along with this one please visit us at Neptune cigar.com or you can also visit us in person and one of our superstores in south you",

        "video_sub_title": "[Music] hey there and welcome to this week's video blog your energy levels and orexin what it is and how to raise it this video is for you if a you're struggling with chronic fatigue and looking to repair your energy production system b your energy levels are okay but could use some improvements in other words you're looking to optimize and feel your absolute best or c you're a health and wellness practitioner looking for additional tips and strategies to help your clients battle fatigue and optimize their energy levels whatever the case may be i strongly feel that just about all of us could benefit from optimizing our energy levels i'm jennifer ellis shoots and you're watching the wellness code academy channel where i chat about innovative and cutting-edge ways to support health and wellness which includes all things functional health as well as mindset the mind-body connection energy-based testing and healing modalities limbic system impairment neural rewiring habit change and personal development from both the lay person and practitioner perspective be sure to subscribe to my channel by clicking on the red subscribe button below and hitting the bell next to it so that you don't miss a week's featured video okay i presume that we can all agree that one's energy levels is likely one of the most precious commodities we have having optimal energy levels alertness and focus are essential ingredients for robust physical mental and emotional health and thus creating an active joyous and purpose driven life chronic low energy prevents us from being the best versions of ourselves when we feel fatigued and foggy we don't have the motivation to get off the couch we can't think clearly or perform well and thus we can't be the parents spouses students employees business owners lovers athletes friends etc that we are capable of being daily life tasks often become a struggle i wonder if you can relate to any of this as somebody that has navigated a severe case of chronic fatigue syndrome i surely can sadly however chronic fatigue has become a worldwide epidemic for all age groups children are not spared furthermore according to a study done by the national safety council 76 percent of workers report feeling too tired at work 53 percent report reduced productivity and 44 percent report having reduced focus the nsc says that chronic fatigue impacts most everyone to some degree and can lead to disaster all too often impairment of our energy production system most often begins as subtle whispers these whispers eventually turn into screams if underlying dysfunction is not adequately identified and properly addressed some of the hallmark warning signs include frequent daytime fatigue but tired and wired at night brain fog and inability to focus easily mentally fatigued after cognitive tasks such as reading and studying prone to anxiety and depression sugar and carb cravings gut issues post-exertional malaise which is an energy crash after physical activity chronic body aches and pains sleep issues and waking up unrefreshed and poor stress resilience and easily overwhelmed by life's demands these symptoms typically appear on a spectrum from mild to severe when it comes to chronic low energy there are of course many causes and variables to consider with adrenal and thyroid hormone issues being some of the most widely known about but a big factor which is not hardly known about nor addressed is orexin or rexin also known as hypocretin is a neuropeptide made in the hypothalamus of the brain with significant influence on several physiological processes additionally it is likely one of the most important compounds when it comes to our energy alertness and focus especially in the first part of the day orexin plays a critical role in modulating our sleep and wake cycle our ability to exert ourselves physically and mentally arousal and goal-orientated behavior including sexual arousal carbohydrate metabolism glucose control and insulin regulation energy expenditure and metabolic rate in other words how well we convert ingested calories into usable energy appetite and food intake when orexin levels drop we tend to crave sugar carbs and starches no bueno activation of the prefrontal cortex of our brain which is home to higher level thinking skills that allow us to be the best versions of ourselves autonomic nervous system function the ans is the master control center for all involuntary metabolic processes such as breathing heart rate digestion stress response sexual function and more and lastly hormone regulation including but not limited to insulin which i already mentioned glucagon acth which is an adrenal signaling hormone growth hormone and more basically when orexin levels drop off we feel fatigued foggy mentally and emotionally fragile and very unmotivated under these circumstances daily life is often a drudgery so hopefully this helps you understand that orexin is a big deal when it comes to maintaining balance in our bodies and in our lives unfortunately the only way to measure our erection levels at this time is to analyze cerebral spinal fluid obtained from a lumbar spinal puncture this is rarely done for erection levels and certainly not advisable in my opinion very invasive the way i see it considering the critical role that erection plays in the body suffering from chronic low energy is proofing off of low levels and having an invasive medical lab test confirm low levels would not change the approach furthermore no one supplement medication or intervention will cure or fix orexin levels correcting low erection levels requires addressing the factors that cause it to fall in the first place and bringing the body back into a state of homeostasis okay when it comes to supporting optimal erection levels here are some important physiological lifestyle and nutritional factors for you to look into and begin addressing number one get rid of chronic inflammation this is absolutely the starting point when the body is inflamed so is the brain chronic inflammation is a leading cause of erection suppression chronic inflammation is often set in motion by gut dysbiosis toxic overload both chronic gut and intracellular infections poor sleep quality and ongoing psychological distress anything that you can do to reduce inflammation will support the production of healthy erection levels the tips and strategies that i'm about to share with you in this list is a great place to start next up number two move your body in nourishing ways daily you can support optimal erection levels with both rigorous workouts as well as gentle consistent movement as often as possible throughout your day take the elevator instead of the stairs park far away from the building entrances and use the opportunity to walk take a gentle two to three minute stroll around your home or office and do some light stretching each hour of the day or as often as possible gentle movement between meals is especially important to help prevent blood sugar spikes from inhibiting orexin production number three get at least 15 minutes preferably up to 20 or 30 of morning sunlight within the first 30 to 60 minutes of waking each day light is a critical environmental cue that profoundly stimulates the production of many essential hormones and neurotransmitters with erection being at the top of that list if natural sunlight is not available then consider using a light box that emulates natural sunlight number four get rid of excess body fat high levels of body fat contribute to both chronic inflammation and leptin resistance both of these factors impair the brain's ability to produce erection number five be mindful of carbohydrate and fat intake meals too high in fat or carbs especially refined ones and not balanced with adequate adequate levels of protein will cause erection levels to nose dive too many carbs which convert to glucose block the production of erection by telling the brain there are plenty of energy molecules available so no need to produce more this is a big reason why people experience energy crashes or carb comas after consuming carb heavy meals a higher amount of healthy carbs in the evening such as root vegetables sweet potatoes and winter squashes are likely to support your ability to wind down and sleep better but during the day they definitely run the risk of blunting your energy number six eat ample amounts of clean healthy protein at each meal amino acids from protein are needed to build and repair tissue and stimulate the production of essential enzymes hormones neurotransmitters and neuropeptides such as orexin unlike carbs and fats our bodies simply do not store protein and therefore there is no reservoir of it to draw from when we run low for sustained support of erection production we need a consistent intake of protein throughout the day adequate protein is also necessary to block glucose suppression ovorexin as i discussed in reason number five okay number seven consume lactate containing foods lactate is an essential chemical compound that supports erection production and the brain's overall energy supply lactate also helps to prevent glucose surges from blocking orexin production some great sources of lactate include fermented foods such as kimchi and sauerkraut kombucha sourdough bread fruit exercise think lactic acid production lactobacilli probiotics yogurt kefir and magnesium lactate supplements number eight consume ample fiber and resistant starch glp1 a hormone produced in the gut increases orexin levels both resistant starch and plant-based prebiotic fibers are needed to support adequate production of glp1 examples of resistant starch are bananas that are on the unripe side and cooked and cooled white rice white potatoes and sweet potatoes vegetables that are particularly high in prebiotic fibers include asparagus brussels sprouts onion garlic and artichokes the caveat however to this would be that if you have gut issues that does not allow you to eat the kinds of foods that you need to which sibo is one of these scenarios then it's going to be an issue in this case then you need to begin by working on gut dysfunction which would fall under the category of addressing inflammation number nine balance your circadian rhythm our bodies orchestrate life-supporting physiological processes according to the rhythm of the sun and moon the light and dark cycles when this rhythm gets out of whack we no longer get restorative sleep restorative sleep is the body's most potent antioxidant without this antioxidant we succumb to reduced cellular function and inflammation both of which will inhibit erection production and finally number 10 take measures to make replenishing your physical mental and emotional energy and cultivating a connection with others a top priority we are human beings not human doings without passion play joy and connectedness our lives become bland and we become less stress resilient numerous studies in the field of psychoneuroimmunology show that chronic psychological stress and lack of pleasure increase inflammation and inhibit many critical health supporting functions including the production of orexin okay that's a wrap for today's video blog i do hope you found value in it as well as some ideas for practical action steps that you or your clients can begin taking to boost or rexen and thus energy levels until next time be well and be empowered you",

Also, replace it every three months or even sooner if necessary. Brushing must be thorough without pressure and should last approximately two minutes using a toothpaste with  fluoride in a small amount to avoid excess foam during brushing we suggest the following technique divide the teeth into two groups to avoid forgetting the upper and lower ones and always follow the same sequence first brush the outer faces of the upper teeth to do this place  the brush perpendicular to the tooth slightly inclined towards the gum and make several times a gentle turning movement on the surface to advance to the next tooth separate the brush advance and in the initial position repeat the movement always brush from the gum to the tooth and not to the  reverse to prevent the gum from being damaged when  When you finish brushing the outer faces continue with the inner ones using the same technique after the inner faces stand up, grind the faces using a back and forth movement and once the upper teeth are brushed continue with the lower ones as before with what the  brush perpendicular to the tooth slightly inclined towards the gum and make several times a smooth turning movement on the surface after the outer faces continue with the inner faces always following the same order and finally the grinding faces also brush the tongue since in she retains a lot of debris to do this stick out your tongue and place the brush as far back as you can but not too far to avoid nausea then sweep forward and repeat this step several times",

        "video_sub_title": "should always be proximate to the joint will go I'm distal to the dome the ones you guys have is essentially the same thing but instead of having a flat part in which you place on the finger you're just place you know you have the protractor sort of perpendicular and then this is how you'll place they so between the stationary aren't sorry and that will the move go on so if you want to measure for instance finger thanks deep in flexion so can you try and can you just make a fish actually so you place here and that's how you measure so I got about 80 degrees how physically flexion here so again this is your bony over right here and you're placing the arms just like so I like the protractor on the protractor is it did that's hyperfunction so how do you yeah hyperfunction is when you want to measure so capable if I sleepy can hyper exchange so he kicked quite hyper action as much as I do but I'm just going to show on my own thing you see how i grossly hyperextend Mike Kennedy I know so this is how you measure hyperextension so you have a higher education component in which you can measure like that to be kind of measuring backwards is a different feeling but it's to its to her point though because 0 starts there yes yeah so that's where this is adding confusion on this one because it's just always going to line up a zero my fraction will be near lumen let me think where I'm not used to make one myself so you will get again for this the protractor it is a little off for that you have to say this gonna open it won't make sure that next year when we make it available we'll try to get the other flash that populism you're about the same price I'm not sure why we got these days here um I mean to me it's just to add contrast there so the movable arm the stationary aren't is always the one with the protractor so it's it's awkward because there's no arm attached to the protractor on your finger ones okay but for the hyperextension my friend over there kudos for him not for me he said he talked about placing here does he then you get into the hyperextension component so here the other ones we use to end its gross sorry so once we used to have can you can you help me here can you hold it like this thank you so something like that yes that's how you would measure I know it's very gross i agree she's broken okay and then for flexion so my p.i.p would go from when you're recording it would go from plus 22 then can you be the therapist thank you two to about a hundred so that's my p.i.p flexion and that's my P ipx nation and then this is for the hyperextension component here like nice got it okay p so can you try and bring your finger all the way so he hyper extends through the mCP joint so you're placing like this stationary arm proximal movable arm digital and can you make a fist now so he goes from about plus 20 to about 90 degrees like this okay there you go so just like that VIP same thing can you extend so he hyper extends a little bit so he hyper extends to about 15 degrees and can you flex the pipe a joint so bent the pipe a joint as best as you can like that the same thing for d IP joint for your thumb can remove exactly how they textbook does because I do it slightly different from the time does anybody have a title here back stationary arm proximal to the donut joint movable arm distal to the joint so can you extend your thumb you'll bring your thumb out so he hyper extends a little bit to it that way and then can you turn touch here so bend your thumb in so measuring mcp joint and the same thing for IP joint for CMC joint I do have to rely myself because I don't measure like your textbook in my process so here for the CMC joint for CMC flexion you're placing the goniometer so stationary arm parallel to the longitudinal axis of the radius so here sorry the other way stationary arm parallel to the axis of rotation axis right on the CMC joint and then the movable arm on the door so of the matter of the first metacarpal and then you ask your client to flex so flex your thumb down and you're getting that measurement do you see that so we liked your thumb for a second so this is the relaxed position stationary arm parallel to the radio to the radius axis right on the joint movable arm on the dorsum of the first metacarpal you're in front of everybody else by their perfect thank you and then curl your thumb to touch here down like this got it and then some CMC extension parallel arm one arm loans through no axis of the radius now we put the protractor on the other side and then the other arm chill just relax your hand so you get your client or patient to relax there handsome we aren't parallel to the axis of rotation off the radius and then you already started on an angle as you can see can you see that how you start because naturally your thumb doesn't sit like this your thumb sets on an angle we explained that remember this is what makes it different from monkeys monkeys had thumbs like this where as human beings had coming in about 90 degree in relation to the main plane of the hand so when you're placing these axis on the CMC joint stationary arm lined up with the radius movable arm lined up with the first metacarpal just like that there's little air like this so now can you bring your some nice if you're hitchhiking come up and then you move and that's the measurement so you're starting already when i'm starting with him he's already starting at about 25 so he goes from 25 to can you move up again to about 50 so he has 25 degrees of CMC extension okay and then for the rest the ones that we showed your measuring on here correct on this side here yours the easiest way is to actually put on the outer border of the wrestle here might be better to do basing can't can you move the camera off of it good thing we don't work in Hollywood something all right Ellie I guess we wouldn't get it done yeah okay so move full arm stationary arm lined up with the ulna here you'll find the axis of rotation remember the axis of rotation for your wrist joint sort of moves as the movements happening so just move your patient back and forth think about the monkey bar so heat axis of rotation as far as I'm concerned it's kind of around here isn't it not everybody agree with me kind of here that's where you put the access right there and then can you bring your wrist bank Starbuck as you can and as you see it's already moving a little bit can you zoom in bit more I'm here just work and youth group and then okay thank you so access we kind of figured that would be there but as you see it changes a little bit so your ship just like just like we do with your shoulder staying that our fourth decision you have a shoulder problem go see one of the doctor give the main brain your shoulder right back back back and then you get it can you see that and then flexion so you have to move again you need to shift a little bit your ox's that lined up with the owner the movable arm lined up with the fifth matter purple and access where you kind of figured the opposite would be so here okay radio and on a deviation same thing so movable arm lined up with the midline of the form solar stationary on movable arm lined up with the third metacarpal access where your access should roughly be with your roommates going roughly right around here place that move towards your little finger make sure you're not lining up with the finger and you're actually doing with the third metacarpal or you get the wrong measurement has about 30 degrees off on a deviation in it can you go into rated deviation please any degree so he does from a supination it will line up the move go armed so stationary arm is perpendicular to the floor correct and then you'll get the most part of the movable arm touching the front part or the gold part of his wrist and then this is you put the protractor basically touching is raised on the underside just like that simple and then for formation elbow tucked in so little sitting alone thank you again on the island border stationary armed perpendicular to the floor protracted touching his on the rest and then they move on on the dorsum of his wrist touching as much as possible the back of his rich simple isn't it simple the only difference is that days you had hot protractor so I shall you know you're actually touching the the arm on the skin that's the only difference but basically if you really see there's no difference i'm taking measurement that I'm taking here is about 70 80 degrees and it's 80 degrees here roughly between 7am between 75 and 80 so that's the only difference and you see that referenced difference difference here different here got it everybody okay",

okay and how does the other side Oh Sadie's fine the other side is fine all right and how long have you had this exactly how many whoa yeah I think you fall into three or four months so what it's looking like is you may have a part of your nail that's digging in to the skin what should we classify as sort of like an ingrown toenail so the shape of the nail is going into the skin onto the side so this area that you can see that's kind of raised is sort of your skin's reaction to the discomfort that it's feeling on the inside so I will be as gentle as I can when I go to try to clear this and see what's happening it can be a combination of dead skin that also goes up in the corner and it's like these ridges we call a sulci in here so I'll be able to clear and see exactly what's going on and I'll be using a machine afterwards to see if we can really get you to we can get now - so smooth it over all right now everything I go to use again can look a little strange but the aim is to give you comfort so if it is uncomfortable just let me know and I can always change it up for you and then we can go from there does that sound okay with you so perfect so we start off first with the antibacterial I'm using another form of antibacterial - and I'm going to do that side as well so comfy good firstly I'm just going to be using a tool now just to see how much of the nail is attached and how far it is going onto this sides how does that feel okay do let me know if it's uncomfortable more than happy to take a break for you and we go soon LF she goes all the way down here mm-hmm just all the way over here is how we get the pain right there that's area please okay so there's actually a good like your nail that curves and it's quite like sharp just there yeah yeah yeah yeah we got a hold on bear with me so okay still yeah yeah all right so I'm gonna cut that part of the nail okay and then I'm gonna use another device as well just isn't really smoothing it down and to help the nail so as it grows it should be a little bit more comfortable okay so far yeah good all right so these I'm gonna be cutting it right down there is that comfortable yeah nice deep breath wonderful doing so well excellent was that okay yeah good right and you can see just there that's where you feel the pressure right oh yeah yeah and that's where your nails actually coming in right there so instead of using the tool that I've just used I'm gonna use what we call a scalpel technique to be able to get reaching that little corner there again you won't feel much at all how is that good I'd love to check just to make sure that you're not uncomfortable because you know these appointments don't need to be uncomfortable yeah misconception that podiatry appointments are painful no and we're not using any form of anesthetic yeah because all we've used so far is an antibacterial and that's it so just goes to proof perfect we're just gonna cut the nail again perfect and I'm gonna check underneath as well and then I'm gonna compress to see how you're feeling okay I'd like to take a little bit more off here if that's okay with you yeah yeah I feel that once we do that you will feel a lot more comfortable and do you play any sports together sighs I used to run a lot okay and yeah just not so usually I really use my feet so I need them and how do you feel this in the shoes like when you're wearing trainers how does it feel I mean yeah begin usually be painful but usually you like I'm he's gonna be fine because usually the pain yep uh yeah it's a great thing to do is if when it feels uncomfortable is to do like a salt water soak yeah just help cleanse and alleviate the soft tissue stress that you're getting have you ever done that before really worthwhile a piece of now that just came out yeah sitting inside perfect right you might feel that's a little bit tender because we've had to go through in that area but how does that feel at the moment nothing pressing nothin nothin spinning in case you don't use this I'm just gonna get rid of the hard skin that's sitting on this area and check the others corner and then I'm gonna be using a machine now what the machine will do is it'll just allow me to smoothen the nail yeah and to prevent any sharpness that can irritate the sides of yours the skin yeah this side is actually perfect so that's the sound that the Machine make this a little bit loud and what you'll feel is a bit of vibration may tickle ever so slightly to okay now I know it looks strange but the only reason it looks like this is because it enables me to get into the very riches of what we need to get to okay and again if it's uncomfortable at any point you just tell me and I can just change its route [Music] [Music] I'm just gonna use antibacterial again yes so you can see whether now is sitting before and the space of which is [Music] so I'm gonna compress again now oh yeah any sharpness whatsoever nothing okay excellent and on this side that's I use fine to start off with I think I'm just gonna compress it with the other toe cuz that's a sensation you'll feel in the shoe how is that feeling and different angles perfect we don't have an ingrown toenail anymore thank you welcome",

        "video_sub_title": "has anyone asked you if you have Sai bow now it sounds crazy it sounds like something out of Star Wars right but what it stands for is small intestine bacterial overgrowth and it's extremely common and it's extremely under diagnosed what it essentially is is a proliferation of the bacteria in the colon transferring up into the small intestine where it essentially shouldn't be this causes a massive decrease in nutrient absorption and of course a lot of discomfort so I'm gonna dive in and I'm gonna tell you a little bit about what the symptoms are and what you can be on the lookout to see if this may be something that you potentially have so when you have that overgrowth of bacteria in the small intestine it's gonna cause a lot of things it's gonna cause a lot of bloating so maybe 20 minutes after you eat you're finding that you're a lot more distended than you normally would be after a big meal or maybe you're getting a lot of excess gas that you normally didn't have maybe you're feeling some acid reflux but more importantly in conjunction with these symptoms maybe you're feeling some depression maybe you're feeling some anxiety because we do have to remember that the intestinal tract and the brain communicate with each other quite a bit and especially in the case of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth it really inhibits that communication between the two so here's how saigo really works you see your small intestine is about 20 21 feet long and within those 21 feet you've got a lot of bacteria you know the small intestine is where digestion generally occurs basically the muscles within the small intestine are breaking down food and they're making it so that you can absorb your nutrients you're absorbing most your nutrients from your small intestine not your large but then you've got your colon and your colon is a larger number of bacteria than the small intestine because it's got a lot of waste coming through it so it needs a lot of bacteria to counteract while the waste that's going through so what happens is you've got these muscles that are moving food along the muscles are moving through too long but they're also moving the bacteria along and after you eat a meal and your intestinal tract is empty sometimes those muscles are still moving and those muscles will cause bacteria that are in the colon to transfer up into the small intestine where they shouldn't be now when you start getting too much growth there then start making it so that it's Oh digesting food or it's making it difficult for the lymphoid cells to communicate with the immune system you see one of the things we have to look out for is in that small intestine we have a lot of communication with the immune system so if the lymphatic system is stressed out by too much bacteria that shouldn't be there then it can cause all kinds of things like you can get sick a lot more often but that's also going to contribute to your depression it's going to contribute to your anxiety there's a lot more than just intestinal discomfort now you may be thinking this sounds a lot like Candida we hear about Candida a lot because it's just popular and I want to be frank with you Candida is quite over diagnosed and I think it's simply because it's easy to just cop-out say it's Candida but here's the thing Candida is a lot more in the upper digestive so you're gonna feel a lot more in the way of acid reflux a lot more in the way of nausea versus what you would be feeling with SIBO in the terms of the bloating and the intestinal discomfort and possibly the pain but more importantly the mental effects as well at the end of the day Saizo is a much more concerning disorder that compromises your health a lot more than Candida does it's not to say Candida isn't bad if you have that you definitely want to eliminate it as well so if you have Sai Bo what are you gonna do about it and how do you find out if you really have it well that's the thing it's one of these diseases that's hard to really diagnose because it's somewhat ambiguous you know how can you really guesstimate what's going on you just have to look at symptoms I mean you can't really just easily measure how much bacteria you have in your small intestine but the symptoms really don't lie and when they start adding up you start factoring in the mental component to a lot of it makes sense so what will happen if you go to the doctor and they diagnosed you as they'll generally put you on a series of heavy antibiotics because they have to sort of wipe you out and start you from scratch so you can build up the right bacteria again but in the interim if you're suffering for some of these symptoms you can do some basic things at home and see if they help you can try reducing your refined sugars and refined carbohydrates dramatically you see these help the bacteria grow bacteria feeds on the sugar so we want to reduce that so try reducing the carbs try reducing the refined carbs and see what happens additionally start reducing the amount of fermented foods or fermentable foods like coconut because coconut ferments a lot in the digestive system which can be good for a healthy gut biome but not for one that has a lot of intestinal overgrowth so that's the best way that you can start identifying if you have it or not if by implementing these strategies you feel better then that's step one the next step when we go to the doctor get on the antibiotic regimen and get started down the right path because remember if you're not absorbing your nutrients you can't get what you need to get in the best shape of your life so as always keep it locked in here and I'll see you in the next video",

        "video_sub_title": "hello everyone in today's video we are going to see how to prepare a homemade shampoo using shikaka at home this shampoo is more a mild shampoo which really helps to remove the dirt and impurities from your scalp maybe during the first time the second time you may not get the lather while you're there in the shower because this is more a milder shampoo this shampoo helps to nourish your hair and scalp and also it retains the moisture level in your hair and also it helps to maintain the natural oil level present in your hair it completely depends on the dirt and impurities present in your hair for better results you have to use the shampoo twice or thrice while you are in shower we also had a few ingredients like neem hibiscus leaves and aero era into it in order to make it more richer and treat your hair related problems let's see how to prepare this shampoo at home and the ingredients are basically shake I shake acai helps to nourish your hair and helps to maintain the natural oil level in the hair it is mainly used hair cleansing and are mostly used as a shampoo here in India the next ingredient is soap net and the SOAPnet naturally lathers and gives you a foam it helps to clean any impurities or any dirt in your scalp and the next ingredient is Amla as you all know that this is the Indian gooseberries which is called as a ma and I have the dry form of Amla here so in order to prepare one liter of shampoo if you are going to take one liter of water then you have to have 25 grams of all these three ingredients so I would like to add few ingredients to make this shampoo so my first ingredient is to hibiscus leaves hibiscus leaves helps in conditioning your hair and scalp it has a natural conditioning qualities and it really helps to keep your hair soft and shiny and also it gives a very nice bones to your hair and likewise the hibiscus flowers it helps to maintain the moisture level of your hair and also it gives you a mild lather when you really use it with Sheikh acai so it also has the tendency to level a bit I would really like to use 10 to 12 leaves of hibiscus I want to use neem leaves to cure that because name is called a server ooga neva rainy it's not just used in hair care but also in law of Iowa the treatments in skin care and in a serious health aides it is being widely used in Iowa the so I would always like to add mean in any of my hair care treatments because it helps to keep my scalp free from any kind of infection or any kind of fungus or any kind of inflammation or wound or any kind of problem if in case someone has any problems like lies or any other hair problem name is all-in-one solution for that so the next ingredient is basil's which is called as Toula see this is not the regular basis this is called as Holy Basil's and the next ingredient is aloe vera gel so I would like to use aloe vera in my shampoo so for this I'd be using one big cube of aloe vera in the shampoo probably it would weigh around 25 grams aloe vera is anti-inflammatory Andrew fungal antibacterial and antiseptic it helps you to keep your hair from any kind of infections also conditions your hair and also helps in hair growth and stops hair fall let's see how to prepare this shampoo at home I am taking 25 grams of psychic I'm a 25 gram of soap next time in qualifying grams of I'm going to soak these ingredients in 1.2 liter of water all over the night I am taking this steel pan and I am going to put in these ingredients I am using mineral water to prepare this one so I am using around 1 litter so I have added around 1.2 litters and the little extra why we are adding is like because the all these dried ingredients would soak little bit of waters now the shikaka is soaked for more than 12 hours I am going to pressure-cook it then you have to go for three to four verses so that it would be really mashed very well because of the pressure cooking the seeds have really come out from the sheikah Kyle but whereas in from SOAPnet we have to really extract the seeds these are the seeds from sheikah Kyle so we don't want it we have to remove this also but anyway I will be blending it and straining it at the moment I am going to remove the nuts only from the soap nuts I will just show you how to take the seeds from subnet so I am just doing that you can find a nut inside this soap nut we don't need this for our shampoo process so the nut would be like this you have to remove it so here I have taken around 250 ml of water as I only wanted to make this as a anti-dandruff shampoo and also which has a conditioning quality I am just going to add few ingredients to it so ignite the star and I am adding a bunch of Tulsi leaves to it and I'm adding a few hibiscus leaves to it if you have flowers you can even add those flowers and I'm adding a bunch of neem leaves to it and few pieces of aloe vera take this mixture and add into it or you can even add it like that completely it's pretty hot so I'm using a hand blender so after blending it I'm keeping a strainer and strain I further strained this shampoo so there are very high chances that we might get some residue like this from the previous filtration so after doing this filtration now using this one we will be getting a liquid like this and this we can use it as a shampoo I have stored that in bottles like this because these are some juice bottles but are these are glass bottles I really like to use glass these days so I stored the shampoo in bottles like this so I will be refrigerating few bottles inside the refrigerator and I will be using one of this bottle as my regular shampoo I hope you guys would be really liking this homemade shampoo do try this shampoo at home and share your feedbacks and comments

        "video_title": "Use These Exercises To Prevent ACL Tears | Phil Daru",
        "video_sub_title": "[Music] what's going on guys so today I want to go over a question I've been getting lately on how to prevent ACL tears or injuries of the knee now this is very prevalent in the sport of soccer right and mostly female soccer players right this is the most highly predicated injury that we've seen inside of soccer for the female athletes so what I want to do is I want to go over some focus points some exercises that you could utilize to help prevent those injuries or at least reduce the risk of it and also increase your overall performance before we go on make sure you subscribe make sure the notification if you like this video hit the like button and let's get into it okay guys so first and foremost I want to make sure that you guys know that I'm not a physical therapist nor a doctor so if you do have an injury there or you think that you're going to have an injury make sure that you get with a qualified split of cognition physician physical therapist whatever the case may be so that they can take care of the problem or the issue that you may have but these are some things that you can do to help reduce that risk and also mitigate the injury going further all right here we go so knee injury prevention right a lot of times primarily is gonna be ACL tears PCL tears MCL all the cruciate ligaments that you know so stay in that knee function alright so we want to make sure that we have strength there stability overall range of motion so that you can enhance your change of direction all that speed when you go into cutting and moving on the field so focus points right you want to make sure that you're improving your range of motion and I'm not just saying just range of motion from flexion extension obviously the knee joint is a hinge joint but we do want to have some type of rotation in there so that you can pivot and move accordingly if you do not have that all that torque is gonna go into the hip and you're gonna have some problems in the hip into the foot things like that so we want to have a little bit of range of motion there to help with rotation so that you can change direction a little bit more appropriately all right now increasing stability now that's gonna be a key factor we want to make sure that the tendons the joints in there all the soft tissue is nice and strong and stable right so when you're loading the hip you're loading the knee you want be able to reabsorb force and then redirect it because that's gonna be a part of soccer right you change direction you have to get in and out so that you can move efficiently and also so that you're not gonna get injured and tear up those tendons okay strengthen the surrounding muscles all right so when you want to make sure that we're strengthening up the hamstrings the hips right the calves we also want to strengthen up the feet we want to make sure that all those surrounding muscles that support that knee are nice and strong okay we'll go into more exercises on that all right fourth all right you want to have essential all right essential loading patterns I'd also want to make sure that you can absorb that force so the eccentric motion is gonna be important we want to make sure that we're gaining that tissue stiffness all right so we're getting more that tended to be nice and strong so that we can redirect force and also absorb that force when we go to stick our landing and move to get either away from a defender or to get to the goal all right all right force absorption and redirection again this is active agility this is range of motion this is change of direction we want to make sure that we are improving that through proper means of plyometrics and also landing mechanics all right so here's some exercises that we can do to help improve that all right guys so first one we're gonna do is creating that range of motion in the knee the optimal range of motion so we're gonna use functional range conditioning controlled articular rotations of the knee joint so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take my outside arm I'm gonna go ahead and come around and you're gonna get what's called a gable grip right or wrestlers grip here we're gonna gable grip the knee right and hug it tight to the chest I'm gonna flex my feet right then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go ahead and internally rotate right and then I'm going to drive up into extension here then I'm going to externally rotate so I could see my tibia move and then I'm gonna come back down I'm gonna get to the full range come back up all the way then I'm going to rotate and come back down the main thing is you don't want to see your hip kick out as you're rotating the knee so we want to make sure we're disassociating the knee from the hip so we're coming up and come back out and back down up in down up out down you can do about two sets here all right and you do about five repetitions there all right so for the next one we're gonna work on stability right so we want to work on stability of the feet all the way up into the hip so we're gonna use an Eric's pad here you want to make sure that you're taking off your shoes so that you can grab the ground efficiently and you're working your toes and your overall feet okay then what you could do is you could take a soccer ball or a med ball whatever you want all right and we're gonna go against the wall here I'm gonna put my foot up right I'm gonna create torque and stay balanced I'm gonna grab the arocs pad with my toes I'm gonna get up on one foot and then I'm just gonna hit the wall for about thirty Seconds to a minute on one leg making sure I stay stable and so my knee does not bow us in so I want to make sure I'm keeping that that external rotation right and I'm grabbing the ground with my toes creating a good arch here false arch so I'm not collapsed in here that's the main thing so we want to make sure that our feet are strong and we're here balancing our body nice and strong here hitting the wall another way you can do it is grab a tennis ball and back up off the wall a little bit throw the tennis ball to the wall and have to catch each side so now you're working hand-eye coordination along with stability of the knee all right on to the next one okay so for the next one we're gonna start to strengthen up the hips the glutes and the surrounding muscles so first one we're gonna do is called a monster walk so what I did was I'm gonna grab a hip circle here alright you can get this from slingshot alright and what we're gonna do is we're gonna make sure that our toes are pointing forward alright we're grabbing the ground keeping a nice torque of the body especially in the femurs right and our abs are nice and tight so we're not moving in our upper body here right on this step and then replace keeping my knees out making sure that they don't valgus in I'm gonna keep tension here on my on my a-v duck ters and I'm stepping out and replacing you want to go about ten to even 15 yards going down keeping a tight body make sure the knees don't valgus right we're keeping tight tension on the band and then we're going back same thing all right nice and strong core is tight right I'm not going too far over where my knees are over my toes I'm sitting back putting load on my hamstrings and my glutes and I'm also activating my a-v ductus okay okay so for the next one we're gonna go ahead and start to strengthen up the hamstrings okay so the reason why I want to do this is because if you have strong hamstrings it gives the ability to stabilize the knee a little bit more efficiently plus it helps with acceleration okay so what we're gonna do is I'm gonna go ahead grab the sliders all right I'm gonna drive my hip up and we're just gonna do the eccentric motion so I'm gonna come down nice and slow five to ten seconds controlling the motion making sure my hips don't drop and all the way out to the end range and then I'm gonna drop down so now we're working that eccentric right working on strengthening up the tissue there right and then we're coming all the way out getting a good stretch squeezing the gluts keeping the hips up and go all the way down so a good good tissue remodeling we're building muscle there from the eccentric loading and again we're stabilizing the hips keeping the glutes nice and strong okay you can do about three to four sets roughly around eight to ten repetitions through all right so now we're gonna go into the drop jump so basically what you want to do is you want to find a high enough box to where you can still maintain stability as you land and we're just going to increase it in time right you never want to go anywhere higher than forty two inches that's a that's a huge drop anything above thirty six now you're looking into more that that risky area so start off low I would say twelve to even a sixteen inch box and then you want to work your way up to about a thirty-two to a 36 inch box so it's how you're gonna do it though alright we're gonna give up on the box right you want to do these barefoot so that you can still create that tension and that torque and your feet so we're gaining that stability there and strength it's all you're gonna do right you're gonna go ahead and step up off the box make sure that you're landing on two feet as I go to land boom right I'm grabbing the ground with my toes my knees don't valgus in I'm keeping nice tension here on the outside of my legs here spreading the floor apart and my torso is nice and aligned alright let's do it again and I stick the landing notice how my hands come back because once you start to understand how to land then we want to redirect force will do that depth jump where you drop down and you drive back up creating that amortization phase so where it's nice and tight so you can reabsorb force and redirect all right one more time okay cool so you want to do about three to five sets of these you want to do a five to ten reps okay so the last one we're going to do is going to be an intro to plyometrics alright so we call it low level plyometrics what we're gonna do is call it skater bounce so I'm gonna go ahead and I'm going to go off one leg and I'm gonna make sure that I sit back into my hip I'm creating that tension on the lateral side of my body I'm making sure that I'm loading my hip my hamstrings and my glutes and then from there I'm gonna go ahead and jump right at a 45-degree angle and land on the other leg so now we're producing force and then we're absorbing that force so we're here arms are tight just like you're running they comes off the ground you push off boom then I stick the landing if you start to lean or fall you can jump double bounce but stay into that position so I'm here I push boom double bounce make sure the knee is out I push boom double bounce if I need to and stick the landing Oh but ah okay again this is something that I do for warmups have you seen any of my videos obviously you've seen my fighters do those dynamic warm-ups we increase in again that eccentric strength that eccentric loading and also we're getting the hips strong there that's so it can support the knee itself and then again we're working on that tendon stiffness or that strength there and stability in those tendons so that again we can absorb that force and redirect it all right

        "video_title": "Alternate Nostril Breathing Technique Tutorial | Nadi Shodhana Pranayama - Yoga Breathing",
        "video_sub_title": "hi I'm Brett Larkin today I'm going to be showing you how to do alternate nostril breathing or nadi shodhana which is a pranayama or breathing technique in yoga everyone can benefit from this simple breathing practice unlike some of the more stimulating breathing techniques in yoga this one is safe for pretty much everyone to practice if you have high blood pressure or are pregnant like me you can simply modify this breath by taking shorter inhales and shorter exhales which I'll walk you through in a moment for now know that alternate nostril breathing balances your nervous system brings the left and right hemisphere of the brain into balance and helps draw your attention inward in fact this technique is so effective at calming your nervous system that it's actually my favorite breathing technique to practice before I come to sit for meditation you might find it much easier to meditate and quiet your mind if you practice nadi shodhana first let's get started begin by finding a comfortable meditation seat in which your hips are elevated higher than your knees make sure you're sitting on the edge of your cushion or blanket so your low back has that nice neutral curve the spine should be nice and long use your thumb to hold down your pointer and middle finger and then use your ring finger to block your left nostril breathe in through your right nostril for three counts hold and block both nostrils using your thumb and then exhale out the left side for three counts and then you'll repeat inhaling on the left for three paws blocking both nostrils and then exhaling out the right for three now if this hand position is a little tricky for you that's holding down of the fingers and using this mudra you can just keep it really simple and just take all three middle fingers down and have this mudra and just block the left with the pinky and the right with this thumb experiment with both this and this and see which works best for you an important detail here is you want to make sure you're blocking right below the bony cartilage in your nose so not too far down on the nostril you want to be right up right below that bony cartilage you can begin to modify this breath by extending the inhales the exhales and the breath retention so for example in our sample we inhaled for three paused very briefly exhaled for three inhaled for three paused very briefly and exhaled for three however as you become more advanced in this breath you can begin extending those inhales and exhales and the breath retention in the middle for example inhaling four five pausing at the center for five and exhaling for five or inhaling for eight pausing at the center for two and exhaling for eight if you just want to make sure the inhales and the exhales are always equal length the breath retention where you hold both nostrils closed at the top is optional especially if you're new to meditation or pregnant you may want to skip that breath retention piece all together but some people find that that is one of the most magical places that you can really quiet the mind when you're sort of holding and retaining the breath in before exhaling to either side let's try a few more rounds together with a simple three count for the inhale and exhale just holding for one at the center picking whatever muj is gonna work best for you let's all block the left nostril exhale through the right inhale through the right hold and block both so the thumb presses the right nostril and exhale through the left inhale left hold and block both exhale right practice this a few more times on your own inhaling right finding a gentle pause exhaling left inhaling left hold block both right under the bridge of the nose exhale right do three or four more rounds on your own try to keep the rest of the body relaxed shoulders glide down and back head aligns directly over the tailbone visualize yourself getting longer and taller from the base of the spine all the way to the crown of the head [Music] [Music] do three more rounds on your own [Music] [Music] finish up whatever round you're on breathing out the left or right nostril and just let that right hand return back to the right thigh or your lap close the eyes inhale take a deep breath in breathing in through both nostrils keeping the chest lifted exhale allow the sits bones to be heavy two more like that inhaling getting taller through the crown of the head exhaling allowing the sits bones to way down [Music] over the course of the next few breaths just observing the quality of your energy after practicing this simple breathing technique [Music] with your eyes closed you can simply inquire within if you feel more balanced or more calm [Music] and with complete acceptance for however it is you do feel you may choose now to stay here in a comfortable meditation or to bring the hands together to prayer at heart center to move on with the rest of your day whichever you choose thank you for breathing and practicing with me from my heart to yours namaste [Music] you",

        "video_sub_title": "Welcome back to HD Beauty educational video series channel. While people are concerned about the health of their heart, lungs and kidneys, few think about their pancreas that lies in the abdominal cavity behind the stomach. However, to enjoy overall good health, you must not ignore the health of your pancreas, which is an incredibly important part of the body. in this video you will learn about How to cure pancreas problem naturally. Your pancreas has two basic functions \u2013making insulin to control your blood sugar levels and making enzymes for the digestion of fat and protein. The pancreas helps the body break down foods more efficiently and absorb their nutrients. Also, along with insulin, this organ produces many important hormones like polypeptides, somatostatin and glucagon.If your pancreas does not function properly, several health problems can arise, including diabetes, pancreatitis and even pancreatic cancer. Probiotic Yogurt Yogurt with live, probiotic cultures is another amazing food that is good for your pancreas. Probiotic yogurt helps replace and replenish the healthy bacteria in your gut, which is important for a healthy digestive system. A healthy digestive system is important for pancreatic health.It also has been found to be helpful in treating problems associated with the pancreas. Garlic Garlic contains a compound called allicin, which has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties as well as pancreatic cancer prevention ability.Garlic also contains other beneficial nutrients, such as sulfur, arginine, oligosaccharides, flavonoids and selenium, which have positive effects on pancreatic tissues. Blueberries Blueberries are rich in antioxidants, which can protect the pancreas from oxidative stress resulting from free-radical damage. These berries can also reduce your risk of developing serious conditions like pancreatic Cancer. The compound pterostilbene in berries increases self-destruction of lung, stomach, pancreatic and breast cancer cells. Broccoli Vegetables belonging to the cruciferous family, and particularly broccoli, are highly beneficial for pancreatic health.

        "video_sub_title": "hi I'm Bob from physical therapists throughout any physical therapy together we are the most famous physical therapist on the internet and I'll kidding of course Bob Brabham death is for a while know it took a little sabbatical for a couple three weeks so yeah let's get going they're going to walk about strokes okay and one of the problems with strokes after the stroke is balance and I'm going to show you some balance exercises you can do at home after you've recovered and this is for people who are already to the point they're lucky enough where they recovered where they can walk okay after Joaquin is unsteady all right what I say all right on a fairly safe generally safe public probably using a cane it may not even be user to camera there higher level alright and you can do this for balance even if you haven't had a stroke okay okay and you understand all makes sense as we get into this so you remember from school the three things that hold your balance Bob sure what vision yes proprioception yes vestibular you've got it okay we're going to talk to that we're going to tax all those and we do have a volunteer volunteer from the audience today and it's a cow Callie Callie you're a caller Karen no Kayla Callie Callie come on in sorry sorry sorry well Sally is a student a junior undergrad for just amazing camera okay why don't you stand here now what I want you to do this is first phase you're going to bring your feet together so your ankles are touch and now some people may not get that because of your knees and your and they had me but just bring your feet as close as you can you're going straight ahead and you're going to cross your arms just like this okay and then now if someone has poor balance you may have to have someone up both side so Bob you can stand there and this is how you would be if someone's off in their little shape I would say they have a belt around yeah we could even go with the DOE value better believe it so but if someone is comfortable from the hospital you probably have a belt okay and this way you can do it one person because I know you're going to people yeah so okay so here we go and you're going to do this for 30 seconds now the time isn't necessary but we're going to use a standard 30 seconds and where you get this from the folding dog test in the sensory organizational test which is too scientific but these are good quality bounce test and we have the devices do the sole now 30 seconds no swing everything looks good then you go to the next higher phase and we're going to close your eyes so that takes the vision out of the picture right a lot of times and I don't Bob and I have seen this a lot where all of a sudden people start swaying when they believe I was swam yeah you all last night okay all right and you're going to look at your watch or maybe have your clock on the wall and hold that for 30 seconds if they're doing well with that okay the next thing is the pro pro chefs proprioception this is a knee pad I got from home they recommend a three inch foam pad for the official tests but anything that's soft and squishy and it's going to throw off their bounce so you're going to stand on this okay and you feel that squishy makes things work a little bit harder okay and if they're standing with their eyes open then their eyes closed okay energy level - yeah you can see the angles working down here exactly okay now if you really want to get more official that dome is what they use so you don't close your eyes your eyes are open and they're accepting information I see but the dome for me makes too hard to make so the next best thing is take a pair of sunglasses put some tape over them and here can you put those on another one and now she can keep her eyes open so it's more relaxed at a normal sensation there especially as someone with a stroke may have problems maintaining eye closure and this makes it easier they use for a doll you know if they make this kind of a paper mache thing Beibei I thought about putting a paper bag over okay very good so the next step if they're doing really well with that okay off here feet together again we're going to start all over eyes open close here if she's steady here and then proudly at this point now you're going to let's go down here you're going to take your right foot and you're going to touch with your toe right there now touch straight out to the side bring it back to the starting point and now see if you touch across and back to the starting point and that's straight behind you back to the starting point okay so it's one two three four kind of like dancing okay but this is going to be harder so you may have to hold onto that belt the first time they're doing it if you have a cane that you might want to hold the cane okay go ahead and do it one two three four you passed it okay he looks the hardest yeah now we're going to go to this put these on the next step up yeah three going across yeah okay go ahead not quite there you go - and she's still doing very good now it's being a little bit more difficult in the same set up I want you to reach out as far as you possibly can you're going to bend this knee a little bit and reach out really far just touch your toe go ahead touch way over well she's got great balance and back okay you know what they can do with the other side ah good idea about this tax or panel gap see she's already in more trouble people get me go their dominant yeah see she's kind of a normal individual you'll see that they have a one side that's better than the other this is where the therapist really start to have fun let's go ahead Bob hey here we go this is the ultimate on the foam we got the dome eyes covered and now let's do the same thing reach over the right flood there you go look at this left angled work and this is where you're definitely going to have someone hold it on you yeah and you do have to be careful on the phone if they have a weak egg right you won't want to do it because you could roll it alternate yeah okay now do the other leg we might as well be complete she's getting smarter on that one how old are you she's 20 years old healthy young 20 year old and that gives you a baseline for that but if you have someone after stroke you're probably wanting to get to the fall yeah so you go by the individual saw potential BC have a belt on them to people if needed and it's a great exercise okay you want to sit down you can sit down with us to finish off all right all right thanks a lot of folks subscribe again ok we'll show you more of these I'm thankful just keep placed right now missing",

        "video_sub_title": "so a man is Chad house here so three ways to lower estrogen levels in men now why do you want to lower estrogen levels because it counteracts it with your testosterone level so high aspersion levels means it's going to hinder your testosterone levels and you have a chance to lower libido increase body fat and actually have feminine characteristics so three things you can do to naturally lower your estrogen levels you're gonna find a lot of them in my new book the man died I'm giving away free copies you can check out a link down below that will show you how to get a free copy sent to your mailbox so obviously get the book but then we're gonna go into three ways to lower estrogen levels the first thing you're gonna do is something that you might not want to hear it's not a salesy thing it does take time it does take effort it's lowering your body fat so you cannot have high testosterone levels and high body fat level the way that men produce estrogen is in our body fat we convert testosterone to estrogen in our body fat so the more body fat we have the more estrogen levels we're going to have so you want to really focus on lowering body thought we do that in the man diet so what you want to do is follow a cyclical diet something that will put you at a chloric deficit for one to three weeks and then get you at a maintenance to make sure your that your cortisol levels aren't increasing that's what happens when you diet for too long as your cortisol levels rise and cortisol obviously is bad for testosterone because it literally counteracts testosterone so you want to really focus on proper nutrition that's gonna make the biggest biggest change in your body fat levels next is obviously training you want to get on a workout program but really start focusing on diet and that's gonna have a massive impact on may impact on your estrogen levels next you want to get rid of all chemical estrogens so what we're seeing is a decrease in testosterone in men of about 1.2 to 1.3 percent annually now there's things that coincide with this is it more an increased dependence on plastics and chemicals that increase estrogen levels so this is very important you don't want to drink your water from a plastic bottle you don't want to use basically chemically produced deodorant shampoos soaps you want to go for all natural sources that don't include flax and other estrogens so in the description below I've got a list of chemicals that you want to look out for if it's not 100% naturally made that's going to increase your estrogen levels just because it has so much chemical estrogens or so many chemical estrogens contained in it so really go through your house get rid of your soaps shampoos deodorants toothpastes and up for natural sources there's tons of natural sources out there and they're very they're becoming more inexpensive as capitalism does what it does so really get rid of your chemical estrogens that's the second most important thing you can do third is you want to eat foods that block Roma teas which is the precursor to estrogen while also not consuming foods that are high in phytoestrogens consume foods that block aromatase oysters are great they have zinc the blocks Roma taste citrus fruits are great but you can also supplement so I created a supplement called barbarian it's just a multivitamin that's good for men it contains things like zinc that block aromatase so you really want to focus on blocking these chemical estrogens or this process where we convert testosterone to estrogen because that's how it man get estrogen again the first thing you're gonna do is lower body fat to get rid of chemical estrogens 3 eat more foods that block aroma tase and don't eat foods that produce aromatase or have fight oh I suppose it oh so that's it 3 things you can do right away really start acting on those you'll find more and more lists in the man diet as well as a diet you can follow to lower your body fat levels while increasing your testosterone levels so pick up your copy of the man died Zoid down below and I will talk to you soon take care",

So with this one, we're actually just going to go 12:00, 2:00, 3:00 and 4:00 with the right leg, and 12:00, 10:00, 9:00, and 8:00 with the left leg. So what you're going to do is so with your feet together, you're going to lunge forward, you're going to land softly, again loading the glutes before we load the knee. So you're going to lunge forward, load the hip, and then come on back. Now 12:00, 10:00, 9:00, and 8:00. Once you have that mastered, you're going to add a little extra resistance to it, so have the ball right in front of you, 12:00, 2:00, 3:00, and 4:00. Now to progress this, as we lunge forward, you can press the ball above your head, 12:00, 2:00, 3:00, and 4:00. It's a great one to develop hip strength, hip stability, for the sake of the knee, and all the way up and down the kinetic chain. Have fun with it and be kinetic.",

        "video_title": "INUJ TIP | HEALING NOSE SORES",
        "video_sub_title": "hey everyone it's me as your local nose doctor and today we're gonna be talking about boogers I'm just kidding Dane we are however gonna talk about our nose so if you like me around springtime and wintertime I get by sores I don't know if they're closed source but they're like little stories like I'll get a little sore in my nose because I'm constantly blowing my nose non-stop during the springtime because of allergies and then also in the winter time because that's when a lot of people get sick in my nose starts running and stuff like that because of the cold weather and usually when I'm blowing my nose a lot like more than usual because I already blow my nose a lot but if I blow my nose a lot more than usual usually I usually get a sword because I'm like constantly rubbing inside of my nose and stuff like that so I have a little tip that I kind of stumbled upon like a while back out of that treats well I don't know if it exactly treats cold sores in your nose but it helps - it helps with the pain and it also helps with the healing process so all you need for this tip to get to heal you're closer in your nose is Carmack's this little beautiful little yellow thing right here that I love so much this is my favorite lip balm this is a lip balm by the way it is a original lip balm external I don't music and it says it's for cold sores in chapped lips so I use this on my cold sores like if I get a cold sore on my lip and I would use it on my lip and it helps to deal with that so oh that's how I stumble upon it because I figured if it helps with the cold sore on my lip then what I'm it help with a cold sore in my nose so I tried it out one day and it worked it helped with the healing process and also with the pain because I know the pain is the most most uncomfortable part about having a cold sore is dealing with the pain and it takes like a while for it to heal so this definitely helps with the healing process so all you need to do is go ahead and blow your nose and get all of those nasty buggers out of there and all of the other stuff and just to clear your nose because you don't want to put this on top of the boogers so you want to clear your nose and then you go ahead and take just like like probably like the same amount as you would put on your lips are a little bit less because you don't need a lot you just need a little bit to go on to your cold sore to helping help the pain go away so after you blow it you want to make sure it's clean and clear of any big areas or anything like that and then you go ahead and just rub a little bit on your finger and then just go ahead and apply it gently onto your cold sore in your nose and with me I found that it helped really well with dealing with the pain because I know even if you could just move your nose just a little bit like this or anything even if you move it a little bit the pain from your culture and your nose hurts like and it's an uncomfortable feeling it's like pain and also it like itches at the same time and this helps with that I noticed that it was it also helped made it like smoother you know how it's like trying rough I also made it smoother and just easier to deal with bring throughout the day because you don't once you put this on you don't have to worry about like you got to forget that you have a cold sore and your nose because like you don't feel the pain as much as well you don't feel the pain at all unless you like touch it or anything like that but I I think it was about a week I did it for about a week I would blow my nose and then play on and I did let it like throughout the day I would have some time to just let it air out where I would blow my nose and let it just not put any carbon sauna just let it air out and let the air like lift the natural air and just let it naturally heal and then like at night or something I would put it back on to comfort my nose so I can be able to sleep at night what else oh I looked up online because I wanted to see I wanted to be sure if it was safe and I found the studies were all over the place some people have said that it was totally safe some people said that it was it was safe if used in moderation some people said it was not safe at all to put it on you know to put it on the inside of your nose but the best fit is if you are concerned at all with putting anything like this in your nose the best bet is to ask your doctor asked a physician if it's safe but for me I don't mind like little stuff like this doesn't affect my body I don't know because I know a lot of people are really sensitive with stuff like this but with me it's not like I can my body can see if anything like if this was harmful II my body would be able to take it which I don't think it's harmful for me because nothing ever happened so but yeah if you are concerned in any way go like feel free to ask the doctor because I don't want to be in charge of you like if anything is gonna go wrong which I doubt anything is gonna go wrong because it's just like lip balm like it's not like you're putting Windex on the inside of your nose I think it's okay cuz it's just like right here on the tip of your nose like on the inside of the tip of your nose it's not like it's up here and you're like shoving Carmack's up here well not for me anyways and also you can I'm using this time I always get this time because just to kind of like the ones that comes in a little little tub but you can also use kind that's in a two or the kind that comes in chapstick form they're all the same formula so whatever whichever one you want to use that's I'm pretty sure it'll work cuz it's all the same thing just in different forms but this is my favorite that I always get is the one in the tub so that is it for this video I hope my little tip will help you get through your cold sore healing process through springtime summertime or winter time or fall time whatever season it is I hope this can help you get through the pain of having a culture in your nose and until my next video I wish you guys nothing but good laughs I love you guys so much and I will see in my next video bye [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]",

        "video_sub_title": "Hey it's Rebecca from Blister Prevention. I've got a quick video now to show you how to tape your heel to prevent blisters. This one's a little bit different to what most people do. So have a go and see what you think. I do this a little bit different to most. I use three pieces of tape, two long ones and one little short one. Okay, put the short one on first, right at that curvy part of your heel. There's no need to round the corners for this one. Give it a little stretch to make sure it goes on without any creases. Then put the bottom one on making sure your overlap the previous one a little. And the value of that first bit of tape is becoming obvious. It means you can put this big a bit of tape on without it getting creased at the heel curve, and without leaving any bare skin. The last bit goes on around the back and covers each side, making sure you overlap that first bit of tape again. I like this technique because it's easier to do on your own feet than some other techniques I've seen. And I think it's really important to tape your own feet if you can, rather than have someone else do it for you. Only you know what works best for you. And you can keep your technique consistent. As with every taping, be careful when you put your socks on - you don't want to catch these edges and make them roll back. So if you think that heel taping technique has anything to offer above what you're already doing for your heels, give it a go and see what happens.",

        "video_title": "How to stretch TFL (tensor fascia latae) the right way",
        "video_sub_title": "- If you have constantly tight hips or you have trouble activating your glutes at the gym or in bed. One of the things that you may have found, is that you have really tight, TFL. You have two, so you would have tight TFLs, most likely, sometimes just one versus the other. In any case, if, you've been looking for ways to stretch out the TFL, you may have found a lot of different things on the internet that just don't quite seem to get it and so today, what I wanna show you is a TFL stretch that actually stretches your TFL and actually makes things feel better, so that your hip muscles loosen up, feel a little bit better, and you can start activating your glutes a little bit better. So, first things first, is the TFL is basically this muscle that starts right at, basically right where the fifth pocket is, on your jeans. Basically it's right in on your pelvic bone, comes down and it blends into the IT band and then comes straight down into the knee. It actually helps flex and abduct, the hip. So basically it helps you do this and then it also, help you do a little bit of medial rotation. So what it can do is it can, it can really twist your lower leg out and twist your upper leg in, which gives you that super sexy, medially rotated femur and laterally rotated foot, that everyone has been talking about this summer. If you've looked online for different TFL stretches, you've probably found a number, of different ways of trying to get at the TFL and the IT band and unfortunately, a lot of them leave a lot of room for user error. So there's ways for you to compensate around it, there's ways for your lower back tilt. We're gonna do to, ensure that we get this nasty little bastard, that is the TFL. Is we're gonna get a little pad here and we're gonna get next to a bench or a couch or some sort of surface that you can use to help balance yourself. And what you're gonna do, is you're gonna get set up into a position, where you're on one foot and one knee, just below you on the pad. I do recommend you use a cushion under your knee. Some of you who are more used to pleading and begging may not need it. If you're used to doing other things on your knees, keep it to yourself. But basically the rest of us, are gonna need a cushion under the knee cap, so it doesn't hurt so much. And, I'm gonna put for the right TFL, we're gonna put the right knee down on the cushion, gonna get the left foot flat and a lot of stretches, a lot of TFL stretches online, will tell you from this point, they want you to just shift the hips forward. Kind of like an overeager, a teenager. If you just do a standard hip flexor stretch and then throw in a twist, what happens is your, TFL is a very, very sneaky bastard. And will basically, as you come out, it's gonna force your hip into abduction, right? Which is what it likes to do. So, really exaggerated, it's like this. It kind of pushes your hips over to the side, just enough, so that instead of stretching the TFL, you end up stretching just the liopsoas complex. What we're gonna do is actually, instead of start shifting forward, where we would end up kind of just stretching out the hip flexors. What we wanna do instead, is shift back. Let's bring this other foot, right in line with the other knee. So that now we've kind of trapped this bastard of a TFL, into a little bit of a stretch, right? So remember I said, TFL abducts the hip. Well now we've got the bastard trapped into abduction. And some of you might already feel, a little bit of stretch here. If that's the case, congratulations, you should go talk to your HR department, about hazard pay because you've been sitting way too much. Now for the rest of us, what we're gonna do now, is we're gonna make sure that, we keep this kind of shifted over, so that we have the hip in abduction, right? Basically the femur coming towards the mid line and then we're gonna shift slowly shift our hips forward like this. So now we're taking the TFL, into extension, all right? We're taking the hip joint, into extension, which stretches out the TFL. You should feel it right there, in that fifth pocket area on your jeans, you can see it again. We wanna bring that foot over, so that the hip is in abduction. And then you're just gonna come forward, just like that. I recommend you hold this for at least 30 seconds. I like to hold my stretches for about a minute, when I'm really trying to help develop more flexibility. Sometimes when I'm feeling really mean, really masochistic and sadistic to this little bastard, I'll hold it for longer than that, maybe through a whole commercial break, be sure to subscribe for other helpful hints and tips for keeping your body feeling good. And remember that pain sucks, life shouldn't. (bright hiphop music) So what does good posture look like? Well, I've got my beautiful assistant, Shane here with me today, from Legacy Athletics and what we're going to be doing is looking at...",

        "video_title": "Introduction to Using an Architect and Engineers Scale",
        "video_sub_title": "welcome to the introduction of how to use on architects and engineers scale hello I'm Dan Dorf Miller this is one of several introduction videos on how to learn to read prints taken from my book print reading for construction today we're going to talk about how to learn to read an architect's scale and an engineer scale before we get started please visit my website at www.engvid.com text book and full length training videos for a variety of units and always feel free to contact me at Dorf at Dorf Muller dot US and I look forward to hearing from you there are two different kinds of scales typically used in construction drawings one is called an architect scale and it relates like a quarter inch equals one foot eighth inch equals one foot half inch equals one foot I you know even all the way up to three inches equals one foot the other is considered and that's typically used for the inside of the building the other is an engineer's scale and it is used typically on the outside of the building and it relates everything want Neal to it to an inch one inch equals ten feet for instance one inch equals ten foot 20 foot 30 foot and 40 foot and so on let's start by looking at the quarter inch and the eighth inch side of the scale first notice that we have two scales on here that the quarter is double the eighth and the eighth is half the quarter first I want you to notice the zero marks we have a low zero mark and a high zero mark these high and low zeros indicate which one of these ticks marks down through the middle that we can use the high zeros you can use every other one notice one two two three four five six seven eight and so on on the eighth inside you use every tick mark one two three four five six seven eight now also notice ever so often that they're going to tell you what the number is on the low numbers there's eight twelve sixteen you don't worry about these top numbers 38 goes with the high marks down here you notice one two three four five six seven eight and you could go on through here like that and pay no attention to these lower numbers that are on the lower lower tick marks notice here on the eighth inch from here to here indicates a foot in scale now because it's really small you're going to have these these tick marks are broken down into inch segments 2 4 6 8 10 and 12 inches over here on the quarter inch so it's a little bit bigger we can get more tick marks in there and we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 so here 2 here represents a foot in scale so this way you go to measure full feet and this way you go to measure portions of a foot in inches also let's notice as we go we can turn to scale we've got a lot of scales on here on the top part of this we have a half inch on this side and the inch on this side and notice also that these marks are broken down into we've got a one inch equals a foot and you've got 1 2 3 4 5 6 so you've got that that's an inch then you have a half inch and you also have quarters this is broken down into quarter inches this one's broken down into half inches flip the scale again we've got three thirty-seconds and 3/16 we've also got a full foot shown here broken down in sixteenths of an inch flip it again we got three quarters here and three eighths three inches an inch and a half and now back to the eighth inch and a quarter let's also say the way maybe we just want to check and make sure that the scales right we said it was an eighth of an inch to a foot so let's let's see if this makes any sense let's put the scale down here and we have 10 feet so line it up on the zero mark on one side and we'll read across here we got eight nine and it looks like it's right dead on that 10 10 feet so I would see feel pretty comfortable as I scaled things off of this particular drawing that everything is been reduced down to the proper scale next we're going to talk about an engineer's scale here and an engineer scale is related to so many feet per inch and I'm going to show you a couple things here I'm going to get out my old scale I've had since I was a I think an architect school and look at here we got one inch equals 10 feet okay and you flip it over here to the 21 inch equals 20 feet and 1 inch equals 30 feet and so on all right on around we have 1 inch equals 10 20 30 40 50 and 60 feet the near scale is really quite easy to read for instance here yeah this is in 1 inch equals 10 foot you have 0 5 foot 10 foot 15 20 so you just simply have to add a 0 to each one of these numbers and of course the 10 can also just for a piece of information then can be 1 inch equals 10 feet one inch equals a hundred feet or a thousand feet or 10,000 feet now you'd use the 100 feet and 10,000 feet the thousand feet for 4 maps and things of this nature but for instance here on the 20 scale you see 10 foot 20 foot 30 foot so just simply add a 0 to each one of these and you'll have the amount of feet tube that you have also notice about an engineer scale or perky pretty much just dealing with whole feet here the purposes we're working on the outside of the building that might dimension it 15 foot and 9 inches but if you are using the 20 scale you've got 10 fifteen foot 9 inches someplace in there is a 9 inch so basically speaking you'd probably just mark it right around the 16 foot mark so you'd have to find the dimensions if you're actually trying to build it but if you're taking off information you would just simply put the scale down and measure it measuring using an engineer's scale here now I'm looking at a drawing here this is this is a plot plan of a community and there's no scale actually written down on the drawing so I've got to determine the scale so let's look at this 95 feet and let's see if we can figure it out throw down to 10 scale and it says 24 feet so we know that's not right let's double that 20s into the not quite 50 let's try maybe the 40 scale here we'll put the 40 scale down on there and we'll line it up with a 0 and we got 80 90 looks like 95 feet so it looks to me like this drawing is probably 1 inch equals 40 feet now let's just for fun here let's say the customer wants to know how wide it is from this point on over the widest spot in his lot and we know we have 134 95-87 and I can't quite read that number there so let's just put this down on there and let's just read across there we could tell the customer we got C got minded up onto 0 when we got 100 110 looks like 115 lineal feet across the middle there so that's real simple explanation of how to use an engineer scale on a drawing thank you for listening to this training session and I look forward to working with you in the near future don't forget to visit my website www.realisticpencildrawing.com the building could look like

        "video_sub_title": "top and Brad the to motivate this physical therapist on me today hi folks I'm Bob Shrum physical therapist Brad Hynek physical therapy we have the most famous physical therapist on internet you know Katie of course but you don't see before we talk is we do kind of warm up a little bit you got to get it to energy level up right pumped up okay dad we're going to talk about thirteen supraspinatus rotator cuff stretches and exercises that you can do I'm going to assume Brad that they know what muscle they tore we're not going to go into that that's the supraspinatus yeah the most commonly contour care happens a lot of people who are 80 and over do you know that I believe it I work about 50% of people are eating over are you have done your homework I did my homework salsalin by the way if you are new to our channel please take a second to subscribe to us we provide videos on how to stay healthy and fit pain-free and we upload everyday also please Like us on Facebook right I don't have very many friends and so whenever you like us we feel like we have another friend it's just another yep another feather in her hat we need that okay let's start off with the test read all first off just one thing Brad I was gonna mention one when you have a care if you have a partial tear and you definitely should do some rehab sure and if you have a tear that's less than one centimeter you're definitely going to fold hair you're definitely going to want to still try rehab if it's greater than one centimeter then you're going to may be talking to your surgeon about it so the only way you're really going to know this is through an MRI right okay so you've already seen the doctor the MRI you've got all this information and it's time to make that decision right so here we're going to start off with our exercises Brad kind of some of the easier ones the stretches and then going to the strengthening there you go so the first one Brad is very common it's called a pendulum exercise every therapist knows these basically this is the involved shoulders regular you're going to lean on us on a countertop or a chair or and you're just going to let your body kind of make it swing right yeah it's a it's also called the Cadman's because I think doctor Kahneman when I'm up with it right I'm just going to do one thing there Bob okay that some people especially the therapist will may say oh well you're not supposed to do this you're supposed to let the body get the motion going the arm be completely flaccid have you heard of that yeah I have to start but eventually you want to start getting a little chair a few that string I just wanted to want to clarify then you can do circles one way and circle the other way okay so the next one that I like to throw in is a technique by Brian Mulligan and I like this one actually better than the the pendulum to be there's a reason why some people don't like the pendulum bread they feel like that it pulls the head of the humerus sure yep so this this is to help set the humeral head down into the socket which means nothing to most of you but do something guys you'll feel the difference you're going to find a countertop or a back of a chair and now I'm pushing down into the chair now all of these should be pain-free right Brad right but so make it feel a bit better possibly happen so again my involved shoulder here I'm going to push down the whole time he's pushing that direct shot and I come back up and I'm still pushing down right and I've had patients and we get a lot of comments people do this and they're just they got a smile on their face because they can finally get pain free range of motion I've had a lot of people Brad that like this one there's a couple that don't yeah but I have a lot of people that like it you can do a good set of tender though sure it's going to depend on the size of it here you know if it's complete here this may not be it may not feel great all right do you want to show wand exit egg well of course I do give you a wand exercise what are we going to start first lection flexion okay and then abduction flexion is straight out in front of you like this so if this is my involved arm I'm going to use my strong arm to be the guy that's going to do the work this one's just going for the ride essentially at first you know and you're going to go up there and try and get range of motion and pain-free right you don't want to once it starts getting stronger you can give a little assistance so it becomes active assisted we call that and you're going to bring it up as far as you can if you start to get pain up here that sharp pain don't go that high go just before it and then comes you're working that pain free range and here we go that sounds good like oh right to abdicate abduction is out to the side because you pull your arm away it gets abducted I'll keep your thumb up so I mop you up like you're doing a hitchhike up towards heaven there we're going up like this and down again this arm initially is just going to go for the ride pain free range if you get to here it starts to hurt well we'll back down don't push into that pain think that's going to get better because it's not we just work it and over time you'll get it up higher and higher and get normal you know once you get up to here that that's high enough you know unless you're a pitcher where you're going to need that extreme range of motion or basketball player Oh basketball Saint worry about that alright an excellent Brad is stretching into external rotation you guys are gonna like this one because it's that I've never seen this one before it's a new one okay so you take two involve the arm you put it in the crook hook the crook of the elbow of the other arm sure will go up there grab the thumb like this and look at this you're pulling into external rotation less you get a thumb stretch at that time have you in a double stretch so external rotation simply means the humerus goes this way that work was like this right hard to stretch this way but you can stretch like this right and I'm at in range right now sure so again that one maybe if it's painful don't do it it should be a field good stretch like it needs it all right then we're going to stretch the back of the shoulder here so this is a really easy one you just grab the wrist and you're going to pull over like this right now I was just reading on this I'm not really certain why but they don't want you grabbing here okay once they put a little traction on it I'm assuming Bob you know I didn't read what you read about betcha they're they're just trying to open the gap between between the humerus and the karak\u00f6y process you're right because the other thing they said along with this is you can even try to work on keeping your shoulder blade down sure I'll keep it down while you're doing this and I think by doing this it's not pinching as much in here yep getting that intention out of the top right that he's pulling out this way they'll track yeah and then go over again you'll know if it's nice it's going to feel better with more range of motion numbers the chest stretch you know that one of the things that a bad with a with a when you're pinching your shoulder basically getting the impingement is sometimes your shoulders are internally rolling out and having to hip so a lot of chest to chest your stretch stretch your chest chest your stress Bob so you're going to go into a corner into a doorway and you can lean in like this you can go like this to just bring your elbows way back I don't feel to be able to do it with your shoulder like that exactly how to slice you have a doorway right here if you go like this and you lean in like this out that'll stretch that chest Bob I'm gonna make a doorway on wheels here so we can do it all you need that one a lot don't have a lot of fun with that one all right now we're going to go into strengthening bread we're strengthening so the whole idea is well Bob your knee is you want to gain range of motion before you start strengthening you know if you can't get your arm up to here you're not going to start strengthening until you can get up to here okay now there's one bread you can you know do this on the floor and put some pillows down and so your arms raise up a little bit I'm just going to show you the right side you could do this with both sides at the same time yeah so you're going to go down like this and you're gonna have your elbow your thumb pointed forward right right down here all you're doing is bringing it up like this and squeezing your shoulder blades together while you do it so up here's where the strengthening we're really concerned about yeah we're on is right we called it another video the core you know we're strengthening the muscles around the shoulder blade you have the ones that stabilize the shoulder blade because of your shoulder blades not stable the shoulder joint without errors well believe me yeah on a wig shoulder Brad these will this will be hard enough for you oh yeah it looks like a easy simple exercise but you do it like this and you do it a number of time you're not hard to feel it the next one is Brad you actually some is toward you now and you bring the elbow up and then externally rotate like this right so elbow up so and then turn the arm like that thumb is here I'm just doing it vertical yeah and again I can start to feel that already Brad in the external rotators that it's working yeah so many things feeling it he's not feeling a sharp not you know bad pain it's muscle fatigue up I'm starting to even fight the fact that I don't have a bad shoulder I am feeling it so other muscles are working yeah their neck muscles next one very simple one Brad you're just going to go ahead and do basically like we've said in the empty can exercise in what we call us captions so Oh Bob just wait your collars out of my gosh we can't have that I wonder what your wife say yeah which is how she let me out the door all right so it very simple initially just going to bring the arm forward a little bit like this you have the thumb pointed down and you're just going to go up like this just some repeated right so that is actually we call that in the therapy world scaption it's not straight for any of you and it's not out to the side it's yeah 45 degree on her sole forward there is some mechanics that relate to the shoulder blade we don't we're doing exactly so all right then you can take with you did we go we did get - well of course Bob I'm on the ball now you can just think two cans you can take - sue sure soap Canada is going to start doing these you know these are five pounds waves if you got an injured shoulder you know I'm not going to start with five pound weights I cans going to just be you know one pound yep and you want to have really good posture while you're doing these really good posture right so even give them the profile Bob so this posture this way the shoulders need to be back and you know that's just a common staple for shoulder health we talk about that all the time alright next one is it what we call out ease you know how do you like a belly button melody you want to get oh I recover after a comment like that because I said you leave the video your external rotation of the shoulder so it's a again now we got to wait and we're just going to go up like this you can even go up higher if you feel up to it right sometimes they put the pillow under towel on either don't they Brad sure I was just gonna do that you can to add anticipates my every move here we go he's put a little towel under here gives you a little separation there right bit in theory if you need to be out about 20 to 30 degrees which that will help do it's not a big deal but it is helpful I think it's elite as more comfortable I'll tell you what this one with five pounds I feel that yeah yeah one pound of an injured shoulder is going to be plaited quit all right next one you can do start doing external location with the with the toothless air tubing or tubing stretch tubing so you would just want to be my anchor breath yes there see now you know I won't let go this is okay safety all right so we're just going I can do bolt at the same time to an external rotation now when you're doing these you'll want to think about your shoulder blades going back and die exactly you're squeezing the shoulder blades together and down right put them down into your pockets because you know you don't want to go back and have your shoulders go up towards your ears all right the last one Brad kind of secure that right there would you I'm gonna go I'll just hold it really low oh okay like this okay and so we're gonna start down here and my thumb is up and I'm my palm is facing me right and now it's facing away that way so okay I'm starting here I'm going here this works on external rotation flexion a little bit of Dolce so in a functional pattern right wha this is d 1 this is the biggest d 1 isn't it therapist out there give us a little common correct Sandefur we're not right we think this is d 2 isn't it yeah the P&F patterns I kind of forgot some of the details I know yeah inside information just forget we said that very good and that's the last one we need all right point your W wallet excellent work however brand I can fix just about anything yes we can but I'm going to use a red pointer here here it comes me but except for that broke working hard you know we're working on exactly right we're not going to give up either we're not that way you",

        "video_sub_title": "you two here's a video on some riveting on your tool projects if you've ever been with sick of the sliding back and forth when you pick these belts on and off which I became pretty much an old of that especially when I use a suspender system too busily they slide and we have to reposition them all the time as well as the pouches so what I did was I thought somewhere that's copper rivets 25 of them for some know $0.50 there are sightings five-eighths one off of ebay they look well very simple to put on there's a ton of videos on how to I don't stall them but the self-explanatory bunch of whole I just having to drill a hole through developing the pouch pushing a rivet punch down on the washer over the over the rivet smashed onto the leather and then credit retained it with a little ball team this is not a Vulcan is one bracelet but I just used some clip up that I had or laying around to get over the rivet and push it down onto the leather and the same with the with the washer we're going to use anything they sell special tools but I don't want to waste my money so they're pretty simple and I'm very effective they don't come out at all means you can see the pouches have rivets as I'm sure you'll do as well and if they haven't popped out it's unlikely if these are going to be popping out of the time soon but they hold really well and you succeed normally these things would be moving around and sliding around but we're so secure that I can just turn this up or drop it down and pick it up nothing moves it's beautiful I did the same thing to the bigger pouches that I have even though these have a three and a half inch belt and most of the pouches stay more secure on this because it's a wider belt I did it because there was still some movement with these these leather straps they hold my suspenders and so I put it all up same thing with the hammer rope put it all on rivets and it works great and the best thing like I said is the position - exactly the way you want it and that way you can just not have to worry about any time you drop your tool belt take it off put it on so forth so hopefully that'll help you out that is something you want to try obviously if you think 20 holes to your tool belt is ruining your delts or table just not something you want to do I don't plan on selling pouches and I bail so I'm not concerned about that but it is going to is going to require you to put a hole in your belt and your conscience oh but it works really well it's a smart idea I saw a guy on YouTube do this with a brass rod and washers except out here in Southern California that brass rods like six bucks and the washers of 25mm amounted to five dollars so it was more cost-effective to buy 25 brass or I'll come back up that's for me anyways but the principle is the same in that once you secure these on they're never going to move it's just something less to worry about and the other advantage is if you've ever worn your your belt if you were suspenders that is if you have ever worn your belt loose you know the things will shift around even more so the beauty with this is that you can almost even wear this unbuckled actually and it's just going to hang on your shoulders and nothing's going to move around I don't do that I just buckled this up very very loosely in fact on the second wall which is very loose around me so I don't even know that I have a buckle that it's basically to just be kept out of the way and it's more like a suspender vest or it's just hanging on your shoulders and got total mobility you've been in over and nothing's nothing's binding on you and it's very comfortable so hopefully get some out of it till next time",

        "video_sub_title": "this is really long overdue but welcome to my youtube channel embrace yourself today today I'm gonna be doing my washer routine for my 4c natural hair and I will show you the aftermath of my twister I usually just go ahead and toast my hair after my last routine and this is the only video that I have to show what it looks like after so the products that you're gonna need are the Luana coconut oil and any coconut oil that you have the bo5 moisturizing conditioner or your choice of conditioner as well as your moisturizing cream or both large rubber bands or hair ties or scrunchies and a detangling brush or you can use their fingers instead so okay so now the first thing that I'm gonna do is just apply a little bit of coconut oil to my hair that way it makes it a little bit easier to finger detangle it before putting it in section actually gonna section it into about six parts sometimes I do eight sometimes I do six a few times I've actually done ten it really just depends on you her tight but sectioning it will make it easier to apply the coconut oil in the conditioner to your hair okay so once you've got the sections into place you're gonna hold them with either a rubber band scrunchie or hair tie I just use rubber bands because they really just work for my hair and I can use them around the house as well so whatever works for you I'm doing horrible at this voice over but I'm gonna start with the bottom right part of my hair generously and massaging the coconut oil into my scalp I'm completely saturating it because I hate detangling it and applying enough coconut oil really makes it easier for me now I'm just massaging some of the conditioner into my scalp as well and just lathering it on really really well like I said before it really helps with detangling process and when you get in the shower most of the tangles are going to start melting away and it's gonna make your life so much easier I'm all about making life easier especially since I'm a lazy naturals this is actually my very first youtube video and doing voiceover in China compiler video so bear with me I'm actually speeding this up really really quickly because I don't want the video to be extremely extremely long and it'll add another two minutes if I slowed it down if you want you can go ahead and rinse off the conditioner in coconut oil while you're in the shower or if you want it to be somewhat of a deep condition you can put a plastic cap or bag over your hair which is what I did and I just did it for a few hours before I'm getting in the shower whenever you're ready you're going to get in the shower and rinse out the product in your hair which this part has really done off camera but basically what I do is I rinse out each section then apply conditioner then I detangle each section and then I rinse that part and then detangle some more because I actually do the process of my twist out while I'm in the shower and for the sake of the video I'll go ahead and show you basically what I do so I Pat the hair a little bit dry using the towel that I haven't shower and then I just start applying my moisturizing cream or products of your choice really lathering that in really well and then I go back over in detangle just in case I missed some more of the detangles when I had the conditioner in my hair and now I'm using a comb I know in the beginning of the video I said I used a detangling brush but that brush broke cause in the shower so I've read it back to comb and it's late at night and I really just didn't have time to use my fingers so like I said you're gonna just detangle that and after you've applied a generous amount of product make sure to put enough product on your ends because of course they're the oldest products of your hair so you really wanted to take care of those I'm hacking do not heck if you have time it's best to really just use your fingers but like I said lazy natural here and then I'm just going to twist and while you're twisting smooth out the piece of your hair that way when it's time to take the twists down it's all smooth and nice and it's less frizz as well my photo taken from my snapchat of what my hair looks like after a wash and it always looks like this as long as I allow enough time for it to dry thanks for taking the time to watch this video I hope to be able to provide you guys with videos weekly so if you enjoy watching this video please take the time to like comment and subscribe to my youtube channel",

        "video_title": "OLD VIDEO! Manic Panic Raven New Formula/New Undertone Color???",
        "video_sub_title": "okay this is gonna kind of be an update about my Raven I'm at penetrating video because when I dyed it before my hair turned green like it was supposed to or whatever but with these two containers that I got oh like a month ago it was purple in the jar it was not black like the other formula I don't know if they have changed you're not I have sent Manic Panic an email so if they get back to me I'll post a video about that and let y'all know what they say but pretty much the old formula if you can see how green that is dark green that is like the color so that your hair would rents out in turn and that is not what color it was this time I put Noren and it was a dark purple you could plainly see I wish I videoed me doing it but I didn't you can see how purple it was in the jar it it didn't even look black it was totally purple there was you know no dyeing it was purple it went on purple in the dark like now it probably looks black it went on really really splotchy too for some reason like the other containers that I had did so much better I don't know if maybe I got a bad batch it was you know two jars were maybe messed up I don't know I don't foresee that I honestly think that they have changed the formula because I did some research because I've been asked the question before about what color the base color as opposed to like the actual bird the raven and i ran on a bunch of different websites and some of them said that they can have a greenish undertone which i was like okay that makes sense because it's got a green undertone it looks black but after I further did my research a few minutes ago actually because my hair is not the right color um it actually says that Ravens hair is like a bluey per their hair because I have had not feathers the Ravens feathers are actually a bluey purple undertone so if they did change the formula this would actually be more accurate because it looks black I don't know if you can see in the light no but if I go outside or somewhere that's lit better than this you can actually see it's a bluey purple and not black at all I mean against this black shirt it looks black but it's not and so I wasn't really happy with it because I wanted it to be black in the jar you know I've used a bunch of their different colors I've used their toner their atomic turquoise the cream formula amplified I've used the cotton candy pink I've used you know so many different colors of theirs but all the other ones I don't know they did they did like they were supposed to I don't know if they've just changed some of them or like what's going on but I know it's not going to be exactly the color that it is in the jar they're just going to take to your hair and I understand that you know like the level of lift matters but my hair has been bleached to almost white and then I've you know repaired it and bleached it a few more times in the last year so I'll probably bleached my hair not carrying my roots probably like four times so there's not really a pigment issue the only issue would be the deposit of the Manic Panic that I've just put on top of it and you know use my tricks to strip it out but so I'm I'm just not really happy with this at all and the first time I dyed it like none of my roots and my baby hair died and I'm like a strawberry blonde natural so my hair is not very dark don't pay attention to these dark eyebrows but my hair is not very dark at all when it comes back it looks like it's dirty blonde and so I believe four levels why maduk sure exactly like what number it would be or whatever and it didn't take and I had to I left it in there for like three hours which that's not very long for me but I left the dye in there for three hours and it did not stick to my roots at all so I had to redo it and it's it still did the same thing I left it in overnight so it stuck a little bit better which I was really surprised because the last time I dyed it the Raven I didn't leave it in but a few hours and it did beautifully and I've even left the electric banana in for like two hours and it stayed so well I was so thrilled with that but I'm just I'm really disappointed with that with the the Raven excuse me because it's got like white sections where there's no dye because I had atomic turquoise in the front right here and it basically went white I went swimming washed my hair and heart water a lot and it pretty much turned white and so you can see like negative spots or the dyes not there and it's not gonna pick up on camera so it's almost like I have streaky old lady grades throughout and I'm just really really unhappy with that so I just wanted to make this video to you know let anybody know maybe if this has happened to you you've tried they're brave and died and it's done the same thing please comment let me know what's going on and like I said if they do you want me back because I'm went to you know manic panic to talk to them to find out what's going on cuz I didn't want to look it up and you know just get a bunch of crap and people not know what they're talking about so I went straight to them so with that being said waiting on the reply and then I shall make another video alrighty thank you I'm nice day",

        "video_title": "Nose Taping to Reduce Scar Tissue and Swelling After Rhinoplasty",
        "video_sub_title": "let's go okay so we're doing another video for taping of the nose to reduce swelling we're starting with the 3m micropore tape it's a very special tape we start with about a one inch strip maybe a little bit smaller at the very top and you press it down now as you press it down the point is you're pressing the skin back down on the cartilage and bone this is a patient beautiful patient who just had surgery cast came off it's only been about a week so it's going to be a little tender and when you press it down you're going to feel a little tenderness but just watch how it swells up beneath the tape inferior to the tape so the tape is actually looking nice and contoured but look at the swelling right there so it's milking the swelling down essentially and you can start to see the real shape of the nose better when the tape goes on so the area that's taped is already looking more contoured more slimmer but this area is definitely more swollen the whole concept of taping is to push the skin down on top of the cartilage in the bone so that there's no room for swelling and scar tissue to collect when you start taping it's best to tape as much as possible if you can tape it seven days a week fantastic six days great five three two whatever any tape that you do is better than no taping if you need the taping not everybody needs taping but if you have more swelling if the skin is a little bit oilier or a little bit thicker topping taping helps now watch this as i approach the tip i keep this finger underneath the tip so it's protecting its position and i'm pushing the tape down now when you get down to that area you stop you make about a three inch strip you go underneath i'm not covering the nostrils it's not too low it's right there and it's going to be a little bit of a v shape it's coming out or maybe a u but it's definitely not pinching don't bring it in together this way you want to go out in this direction and you want this area touching the bottom of the nose so the best way to do it is to crimp it like that make sure it's touching the bottom and now if you look at it there's only a tiny little half dime sliver of the tip open the mistake a lot of people make is they put too much of the tip exposed you want most of the tip covered now that's one layer all the way down the second layer is coming up we're going the other direction same thing you're crimping it and make sure this is touching the bottom so this entire tape is touching the skin this is the most important part really the most important part is that area and then same thing up here going back up putting my finger underneath the tip to support the tip and i'm pushing the skin down you want to make sure it's covered and now look how good it looks the size of the nose already got 20 smaller with a tape on then you come up this direction the tape doesn't go around the cheek don't make it big and ugly just keep it right on the nose this tape is very manageable you can wear it around the clock so i was saying if you can wear it six seven days a week great if not do it at night time you know if you can't go out the house with tape and you have to meet people and you know get on with your life just when you get home at night to tape it it's super important to put the tape on gently but even more gentle when you take it off don't rip it off if you peel it off too aggressively it actually attaches the skin with it pulls it up and creates more swelling so when you take the tape off you want to make sure that the tape is coming off in such a way that it's not swelling up further so take the tape off really slowly we use a product called detachable this is uh there's a link on this on our website uh the detachable helps the tape is 3m micropore and again the more your tape the first several weeks several months some patients tape up to six months some people only need to tape for another couple weeks after surgery if you're active if you want to play a little bit more sports a month or two after surgery if you want to go on a flight if you're doing things that create more swelling the taping really helps not everybody needs a tape most people don't need to tape if you have really super thin skin you don't need to tape but if you do benefit from taping this really helps this really reduces the need for steroid injections i rarely do steroid injections anymore because of the taping so watch the video a couple of times before you do it yourself and the first time you tape yourself send some pictures to your doctor if it's me send it to me to make sure you're doing it the right way have a good one",

        "video_sub_title": "hey everybody this is Joshua Tucker the tendinitis expert and in this video we're going to talk about extensor tendon names it's easy to get it's easy to fix and those reasons promote for that so let's start with what is extensor tendon it\u00eds essentially it's just another name for tennis elbow maybe extensor tendonitis is the more technically correct medically but tennis elbow is the general term everybody uses even doctors use it's the general term but let's say you get a diagnosis of extra of extensor tendon itis how does that help you what does that actually tell you mmm so let's break it down a little bit because that's where the helpful information is that extensor tendon itis is the back of the ham so this is not the palm side right here this is the back of the hand so this is the back of the hand side of your forearm so one important thing to know about extensor tendon itis is that it's the entire ecology of the area if it hurts right here that's not the problem the problem is the ecology of the entire area so that's an important thing to know we'll get back to that and as we break down what exactly it is it's gonna make sense then why restau doesn't work and anti-inflammatories don't work and splints don't work physical therapy often doesn't there's reasons for that and the reasons are is because tendonitis is a dynamic it's a dynamic made up of multiple factors so no matter where the tendinitis shows up whether is your Achilles tendon or your extensor tendons or your wrist pain or neck pain or shoulder pain it's all the same dynamic and that dynamic is made up of multiple factors the first is muscle and a connective tissue tightness the second factor is generally chronic inflammation don't worry about my spelling and the third is nutritional insufficiency meaning your body doesn't have enough nutrition to operate properly now if are the reason why rest doesn't work in that inflammatory don't work and splints don't work and often physical therapy doesn't work is because tinnitus this is a dynamic and all three of these factors are working together to cause pain a problem inflammation eats up nutrition tightness eats up nutrition if you don't have enough nutrition then the muscles can't relax etc so even if you do a little bit for one of these the other two are going to work together to bring that factor back so it's important for any treatment to deal with the muscle connective tissue tightness the inflammation hang on nutritional insufficiency if you don't deal with all three of those and if you don't effectively deal with all three of those then at best it's gonna take longer for pain problem to go away and it's going to come back soon it so in short that's what extensor tendon it\u00eds actually is it's tightness it's inflammation and nutritional insufficiency which makes this whole area not work as well as it should and that leads to pain there may be tightness maybe ache there's different symptoms available but ultimately no matter what the symptoms are in a tendonitis dynamic it's all caused by these three factors I don't want to repeat myself there more but it does bear repeating that those three factors are extensor tendon itis so why haven't you fixed it yet maybe you've tried rest maybe you tried anti-inflammatories maybe you've done some other things you know nerve gliding etc the reason you haven't fixed it yet and it's not your fault you were just told to faulty information the reason you haven't fixed it yet is because you didn't deal with the tightness and you didn't deal effectively with it you didn't deal with the inflammation and you didn't deal effectively with the nutritional insufficiency and therefore the pain doesn't go away or it takes a long time to go away and comes back sooner than you like so I've already touched on it but how do you get rid of extensors tinnitus you have to get rid of the tightness you have to get rid of the inflammation and you have to replete the nutritional deficiency that is how you fix extensive tendinitis so if you'd like to find out more about extensor tendon Titus visit my website then there's a link to the page below and as always the solution is either the reversing wrist tennis program or the tennis elbow treatment that works if you have pain all over the forearm including the palm side and the back of the hand side then reverse reverse tenderizes way to go and if you just have classic tennis elbow we have pain at the elbow about Canada's back hand the side of the forearm then tennis elbow treatment is the way to go there and just FYI depending when you see this I will soon be converting this into an e-book form with specific videos explaining various parts of the program so if you have any questions or would like more information come visit my site",

        "video_sub_title": "Daddy Clay: Today we reveal the secret to getting kids to do their chores. Daddy Brad: Are you ready for the matrix? Daddy Clay: Today\u2019s episode is brought to you in collaboration with Man of the House. Daddy Brad: Now getting your kids to perform a few household chores can be tougher than armadillo jerky. Daddy Clay: Which is, which is very tough. Daddy Brad: Very. Daddy Clay: But there is a solution. Our highly scientific studies have shown that parents go through six distinct phases as they try to get their kids to perform chores. The first stage, 1. Resentment. It slowly dawns on you that kid leave their stuff all over the place and its somehow becoming your job to pick up after them. But because they\u2019re little and cute, you put up with it. Phase 2. Becoming your Mother. Daddy Brad: Do you think I\u2019m your personal maid? Do you think all this stuff is going to clean up itself? Do ya? Huh? Daddy Clay: You will use these expressions despite having personal experience that they are not at all effective. Then on to the next phase, perhaps the most annoying, phase 3 The Julie McCoy. Daddy Brad: Ella, you want to learn the pick up song? Pick up the toys and put em\u2019 in the basket. Pick up the toys and put em\u2019 in the basket. Come on, can you do it? Daddy Clay: Stage 4: Creative Threats. Daddy Brad: If this room is not clean, in five minutes, I\u2019m killing the dog. Daddy Clay: Stage 5: Resignation. You eventually decide that it\u2019s just easier to do this crap yourself. But if you are lucky and en-lightened young, neo-dad, there is another solution. Daddy Brad: The matrix, otherwise known as the chore chart. Daddy Clay: Okay, so maybe the shore chart isn\u2019t exactly a revolutionary concept. Daddy Brad: Yeah, but it sure works better than stages one through five. Trust us, we tried them all. No the concept is pretty simple. The kids perform certain tasks and they put a check every time they perform them. Get enough checks and you get a reward. There are a lot of pre-made charts from the market we found that kids do better and get more invested when they help decide on the task and help make the chart themselves. This can be a fun and a really creative way to kick off the project. Daddy Clay: So here\u2019s my daughters chore matrix. She just made a new one because she filled her old one in and you can see this is very much 9 year old girl. She chooses her own chores and sort of makes her bed, cleaning her room, setting the table. And if she gets a certain amount of check marks, then down here she has a list of places she\u2019d like a gift card form and she can pick which one she gets. And see this, Claire\u2019s, some earrings, bookstore. She spells like her dad. Daddy Brad: She has a lot to do. Daddy Clay: And you notice that there are dots there. Kids love to use these do-a-dots, you can use stickers, or just do the old school check mark, but they love putting these dots in there, and that\u2019s something that makes it a little more fun for them. And we find it to be absolute effective. Does it work for you guys? Daddy Brad: Oh, absolutely it works, its great. Daddy Clay: We don\u2019t even have to ask the kids about their chores because they\u2019re after themselves, they want those dots, they love getting gift cards and so it really works for us. So we want to hear from you, what kind of luck are you having getting your kids to do chores around the house? Are you using a matrix or a reward calendar, let us know what\u2019s working for you. You can drop a comment on this video or go to Dad Labs, or join the conversation at Man of the house. Daddy Brad: We\u2019d like to thank our friends over at Man of the House for making this video possible. And we\u2019d like to thank you for watching this video. And that\u2019s all for us here, take care.",

        "video_title": "What Does a Seizure Look Like?",
        "video_sub_title": "(Music) So, what does a seizure look like? Not all seizures are alike. In order to understand why seizures can look different, let\u2019s look at different parts of the brain and their functions. The frontal lobe is responsible for personality, emotions, problem solving and reasoning. It is the \u201cgood citizenship\u201d and judgment part of the brain. The parietal lobe has both a motor and sensory strip. The motor strip is responsible for muscle movements and the sensory strip is responsible for feeling or sensation. The temporal lobe is on the temple side  and is responsible for speech, language and hearing. The occipital lobe is at the back of the brain and is responsible for vision. Now, another thing to consider is that one side of the brain controls the opposite side of the body. This is important in helping us understand more about which part of the brain might be involved with the seizure. Because different parts of the brain control different activities, where the seizure starts, and how it spreads in the brain, determines what the seizure will look like.  This picture represents the motor strip. It is the part of the brain which controls our muscle activity. If a seizure is in the area of the motor strip,  the abnormal electrical activity spreads in a very organized fashion. If the abnormal electrical activity remains localized, the seizure might only involve the face and/or hand.  If it progresses however, it starts to involve different parts of the body as it spreads along the motor strip. So, it may start out with a funny sound as it involves the larynx and then the tongue may start moving followed by parts of the face, then the hand, arm, the trunk of the body, hip, leg and finally the foot. The reality however, is that the abnormal electrical activity can spread so fast that it makes it difficult to see the progression as the whole body becomes rapidly involved. Other types of seizures involve different parts of the brain and there can be changes in vision, smell, sensation, or taste. A seizure can be as simple as a staring spell which cannot be interrupted. During a seizure some people can be conscious and aware but, they may or may not be able to talk. Others can be starring, \u201czoned out,\u201d unaware and unresponsive with an altered consciousness.  And some people are unconscious. Seizures can involve one or both sides of the body. There can be rhythmic jerking, shaking, twitching, stiffening or clenching involving one or more body parts. When this happens, all of the affected body parts will move together. Another type of seizure involves a sudden loss of muscle tone,  which can look as simple as a head drop, or suddenly falling to the ground. Children having seizures can have drooling or  foam-like saliva coming from the mouth. There can be color changes and the child may look dusky, gray, bluish or pale. The change in color is due to slower, shallower breathing pattern during the seizure. There can also be some odd noises like gurgling,  groaning or sighing while the seizure is happening.  Although seizures can have a variety of different looks,  they have two typical characteristics. First, a seizure will have an onset, so abrupt that it will immediately interrupt whatever the person is doing. And second, you cannot stop the seizure by touching  or holding the involved body part.  And sometimes it is hard to decide if \u201czoning out\u201d is day dreaming or it's a seizure. In this case, it is helpful to touch the person and see if they respond by looking up, speaking or withdrawing. (Music)",

Karthik from MetLife today we will learn about how do we take care of our lung health especially during the Parana virus pandemic as all of us know lung is a very important organ that is required that when we breathe in the air it actually supplies oxygen to the blood and blood in turn takes that oxygen to all the parts of the body the carbon dioxide that the blood brings back is something that we exhale out through the lungs so lung function is very very important for survival of the human body unfortunately what happens is when the body is infected with the virus like this if the immune system is strong nothing to worry but if the immune system becomes weak which can happen in cancer patients patients with immunocompromised and also patients with either diabetes where sugar is not in control patient is having high cholesterol and that is not in control or the patient has high blood pressure and that's not in control that is something where you need immediately need to make sure that the sugar blood sugar the cholesterol or the blood pressure is brought under control and we do something to actually increase our immune system strength last but not the least very important thing about lung health is also to make sure that we eat right so we those foods which have antioxidants in them because infections like coronavirus actually increase you know chemicals in the body called cytokines which is that which are actually which damages many body organs so therefore eating foods rich in antioxidants like force that are having vitamin D foods having omega-3 fatty acids and also foods that are having immune boosters or you know minerals that increase our immunity like zinc or vitamin C these are actually very very helpful to make sure that we keep the cytokine levels low infections are actually warded off very quickly with these immune boosters and naturally keeping the immune system strong is extremely critical to enable our own body to fight against these infection causing organisms",

        "video_sub_title": "How to Practically Cure a Cold in One Day. If you act quickly at the first symptoms of a cold, you stand a good chance of outrunning it. You will need Decongestant spray or tablets Antihistamine Mucus thinner Tissues Chicken soup Hot tea A warm washcloth and your doctor. Step 1. Use a decongestant spray or a decongestant tablet. Cold viruses thrive in trapped mucus. Act quickly at the first symptoms of a cold. These include a scratchy throat, runny nose, and sneezing. Step 2. Use over-the-counter mucus thinner to prevent nasal secretions from becoming trapped in your sinuses. Step 3. Close one nostril and blow gently through the other side. Hard blowing forces fluids into your sinuses and can lead to an infection. Step 4. Eat chicken soup. There is evidence that chicken soup might relieve inflammation contributing to cold symptoms. Step 5. Drink a cup of tea or place a warm washcloth on your cheeks to force the microscopic hairs \u2013 cilia \u2013 in your nasal passage to pass mucus on. Step 6. Call your doctor if your symptoms have not improved after two weeks. Did you know A study reported in the July 28, 2005 _New England Journal of Medicine_ found echinacea to be ineffective in preventing a cold or easing its symptoms.",

looks a little bit dirty and needs to be changed and then they have this here which is their trach ties which is keeping it in place now before we start I wanted to show you something I'm just gonna take this out of the mannequin for a sec so this is the inner part and then here's the outer part there are a couple different tricks that you will see some have a turn and lock mechanism some are a little bit more like this so there's gonna be a variety some don't have this part at all they're just the outer part and that's okay too so they're all gonna look a little bit different this what really this is is like a safety thing so this is kind of just like an extra backup safety thing in the trach to prevent like mucus or any other like airway obstructions so this is just kind of like a double check safety thing but not all tricks have these and this is the thing that we had to take out to clean so I'm gonna put it back in here and we're gonna start from the beginning so we have our trach kit and our normal saline this is going to be partially sterile so what I recommend is opening your normal saline first and then setting it off to the side then you can open your kit remember when we open a sterol kit we open it away for arming ourselves now we got to put our gloves on and these are a little big on me but that's ok ok so now we have our gloves on now we need to make our sterile field so we'll open this shiny side is down and since this little bit folded it stays we just leave it okay then we can take on all of our supplies I'm going to show you what all these supplies are and what they're for so this first one is to clean the inner cannula these next two are going to be to clean around the site closest to where the trach is inserted these pipe cleaners are to clean the cannula if this big brush is a little too big sometimes they're a little too big so you can use the pipe cleaners instead here's a clean trach tie now most places do not have their trach patients with trach ties like this this is kind of old-school NOAA days we have velcro which is much much nicer so we're just gonna get rid of this we don't need this for today then we have a finished treated dressing so this is our dressing with a little slit in it so this is our new clean one and then we have some more four by fours for cleaning now what we're going to do is we're going to get one of our hands dirty and we're going to keep the other one sterile what I recommend is using your non-dominant hand so if you're right-handed use your left hand and make that one your dirty hand so what I'm going to use my left hand for first is to pour my normal saline into my bucket here and then of pour it in all three quadrants all three little things and then I don't need it anymore now I'm gonna use my left hand because it's my contaminated hand to move the trach collar away right because this is dirty so move that off to the side you can just kind of unclip it and then kind of move it off to the side you want it readily available because the patient is going to need oxygen so when you're done doing what you're doing you can move it back real quick now I can remove the inner cannula and I'm allowed to touch just this outer portion with my non sterile hand so when I take it out I'm not gonna touch any of this and just when you take it out make sure you're very careful that you're not like oh no and you hit their chin or you hit their gown or something like that so when you take it out be very careful it only touched that portion so we've taken this out now we're ready to wash it be sure to give them that oxygen while you're doing that so move the trach color back but still only using that one hand because you can't use your sterile hand now we're ready to wash it so we're gonna take it and put it in our first one wash it and then we can take our little cleaner here and get in there and get all the gunk out and clean it really good now we're done with that bit now we'll rinse it in one of the other smaller buckets tap it dry and now it's clean it's ready to be replaced now we need to put it back so get rid of this and put it back in good now we don't have to be sterile anymore and we can clean everything else so one of the first things you want to clean is the big stuff right so get rid of this old yucky dressing okay take one of those four by fours dip it in your other tray remember we had the three compartments and we only use two of them so the third compartment is what you're gonna use now dip it in there get it a little wet and just kind of like wipe around the outside and get all like the big stuff okay another nice thing to do is to get inside the shrink collar itself because all of this in here gets really gunky and gross and full of mucus so go ahead and take a wet one and kind of wipe it out really good okay and now we're ready to use our little ones so we're gonna dip this in our third bucket again and then we're gonna get as close to the site as we possibly can okay so trying to clean the site as best we can and then we'll use our second one we'll dip that in the bucket and then try to clean that site as best we can always remembering to give them their oxygen back finally it's time to put on a new dressing so we're gonna use our fittest rated dressing so the one with the little slit in it okay it goes this direction don't try to do it this way okay so try to do it with the slit facing up and you have to be really careful when you do this that you don't actually yank on the trick or pull it out or anything like that so there it is it's nice and in we can apply the oxygen in our patients good to go one random thing about trach patients I wanted to mention is I highly recommend wearing a mask when you doing trach care or trach suctioning trach patients will usually COFF on you and you don't want to get that in your mouth or nose so wear a mask just to keep yourself safe just to protect yourself I didn't do it for this video because I was afraid you wouldn't be able to hear me well enough but in real life I would definitely be wearing a mask so I hope this video was helpful any questions or comments please let me know and if not I'll see you on the next one",

        "video_sub_title": "hi there I'm dr. Dominic from that fifth checked I'm here today to talk to you about testosterone testosterone is fast becoming one of our most popular at tests and then it's one of the reason for this is because there's increased awareness of low testosterone and how important testosterone is a hormone for guys during video I'm going to talk to you about natural ways in which we as men can increase our testosterone levels so five very base our basic are very simple abroad in which in our how to increase the testosterone levels would include get enough sleep is number one number two is maintain a healthy weight number three is eat enough fat in your diet to actually produce testosterone number four is to exercise are continuously exercise not to excessively but regularly and number five is to keep control of your stress levels going back to those and simple our broader headings and the number one hint that I gave you is to get enough sleep so for many guys sleep is a really crucial factor in maintaining their testosterone levels and I'd say for many of our my listeners you're quite surprised by that but many many hormones in the brain are produced during the night time so when when the brain thinks that it's nighttime it actually produces a special hormone testosterone is one of these hormones so we would advise you to aim for at least seven hours of quality sleep a night I know this sounds like a lot but it's really important in terms of maintaining your testosterone levels so crucially and I know you've probably heard this before but it's so important to turn off your tablet your phone and your computer at least an hour before you go to bed if you have your phone on besides your bedtime your brain still thinks it's it's daylight and may not produce adequate levels of testosterone the second point that I referred to was to maintain a healthy weight this is a self-explanatory as it sounds so basically guys who are overweight they inhibit the own their own production of testosterone because they have too many fat cells in their body unfortunately the same is true for guys who are underweight they're not taking enough fat fat into their body to produce testosterone so maintaining weight is the second piece of advice I have for you a third of these advice I gave you in terms of increasing your testosterone naturally is to increase the amount of softener in your in your diet I know for so many years you've been hearing fat is bad that is bad but actually we now know that anything in moderation including fat is actually really good for you and you need fat in your body to produce testosterone so examples of good fat would be monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats sources of these fats would include olive oil rapeseed oil avocados any nuts peanuts for example peanut butter and also some saturated fats are really good for you everything but in moderation for example we all need some red meat in our diet and and also things like dark chocolate again has saturated fats real butter has saturated fat and these are necessary in certain quantities so don't don't be shy or nervous of increasing the fat in your diet this fourth piece of ice referred to as having an active or taking axis regular exercise so testosterone is really important as a hormone and it controls your muscles and it also controls your bones and is involved in your metabolism so if you're not doing much an activity in your very you know you're spending lot of time the Chi charger desk your brain is telling your body that you don't need a lot of testosterone so in turn it doesn't produce much testosterone but if you take some exercise your brain is telling your body that you're taking exercise and your body will produce testosterone as a result of that it's really important to remember though that excessive exercise also shuts down the production of testosterone so you're not doing yourself any favors by taking excessive exercise so thirty minutes exercise three or four times a week would be what we would recommend some that's get checked as a fifth piece of advice and it sounds like a kind of lovey-dovey a very general bit of advice but it's to take control of your stress but what many of you don't realize is that when your stress their appetizer or feeling anxious or sad your body produces lots of stress hormones are negative hormones one of these hormones is called cortisol if you have lots of cortisol your testosterone level drops so it's actually really important that you take time eyes that should do stuff that you enjoy doing and be it exercise a bit go to the movies or anything that you enjoy doing will actually decrease the level of stress hormone in your body which is cortisol and will naturally increase the amount of testosterone and your body produces so if you've interested in checking faster level please log on to let's get checked and our nurses are there to give you advice either over the phone or through our live chat and they will advise you about the best hormone panel - and purchase for your needs",

        "video_title": "7 Ways to Keep Your Blood Sugar Stable | Chris Masterjohn Lite #55",
        "video_sub_title": "This is how to keep your blood sugar in balance. Hi. I'm Dr. Chris Masterjohn of chrismasterjohnphd.com, and this is Chris Masterjohn Lite, where the name of the game is \"Details? Shmeetails. Just tell me what works!\" And today we're going to talk about a few ways to keep your blood sugar in balance. Alex Leaf, who you may know from his work at Examine.com, or who you may follow on Facebook, where he shares a lot of research, recently posted a few hacks to control your blood glucose after meals. So, he says, \"How can we reduce postprandial glucose and glycemic variability? A couple of hacks are to consume 1 to 2 tablespoons of vinegar before you eat, consume 3 to 5 grams of glycine before you eat, consume your proteins and fibrous vegetables before your starchy carbohydrates, and go for a brief walk after eating. So, if we go through these one by one, the vinegar, it's probably the acid that's important, but I would use raw apple cider vinegar. You can take your pick of choice. For the glycine, to get 3 to 5 grams of glycine, we could either get that from pure glycine powder, or you get it from collagen or gelatin, or we could get it from bone broth. If we're talking about pure glycine powder, then the advantages are it's cheaper, and it's also sweet, so you can use it as a substitute for sweetener. But the advantage of using something like collagen or hydrolyzed collagen or gelatin is that the peptides that you get from those, probably hydrolyzed collagen peptides are best, but even with gelatin, when you're getting it from the protein, the peptides that you digest it into are more easily synthesized into collagen. So if you're trying to think about benefiting your skin and bones, then you're better off using collagen. If you do that, to to get 3 to 5 grams of glycine, you want to use 10 to 15 grams of hydrolyzed collagen or gelatin. Now, bone broth has the same benefit of the collagen and the gelatin, but you also get some minerals in there, and you also get the culinary, the culinary benefits of being able to\u2014 either you like the taste of it, or you can cook your food in it, and it adds the certain texture and taste of the foods that you're eating. In bone broth, it all really hangs on how much protein is there in the bone broth. So if you can verify that the protein content is about 10 grams per serving, then 1 to 1 and 1/2 servings presumably is going to give you that 3 to 5 grams of glycine. In terms of brands, I like Vital Proteins, and I like Great Lakes for the collagen. Vital Proteins as well as Thrive Market is now selling a hydrolyzed collagen supplement, and they use enzymatic processing. It's a little bit more expensive, but some people find it more digestible. If you're just looking to save money, I think Great Lakes is a great brand. For bone broth, there are two companies that I know of that sell bone broth that they guarantee be 10 grams of protein per serving, and that includes Kettle and Fire, and it includes Kitchen Basics. If we go to the next point, consuming the protein and the fibrous vegetables before the carbohydrates, one other way we could put this is you should always be eating your carbohydrates in the context of a mixed meal. So, sometimes people say they don't tolerate carbohydrates, and it turns out that they're eating just a bunch of bananas, and they're not eating a balanced meal. So make sure you have protein about the size of the palm of your hand as a general rule of thumb, or if you have a more specific protein target, use that. Make sure you have protein, make sure you have vegetables, and make sure you have your carbohydrates alongside them. If you really need to manage your blood glucose to that extent, you could eat them in that order: protein, vegetables, carbohydrates. I tend to eat everything all together. At least have that balance. And then exercise is important because when you exercise, your muscles start using the glucose, and if you have the glucose coming in, and it's going somewhere, then your blood sugar is going to be a lot more stable than if the blood glucose is coming in and doesn't have anywhere to go. And so going for a walk after you eat can be very helpful, and also placing your carbohydrates after a larger exercise load can also be helpful. So for example, if you eat a bunch of carbs after you just did a really intense weightlifting session or a really intense martial arts session or anything like that, then when your muscles have been using the carbohydrate, there's going to be a lot of room for that glucose to go somewhere back into those muscles. I'd add a couple more things here. So first of all, I think it's important to manage the glycemic load, meaning how much carbohydrate are you getting in a given meal, and I think it's important to\u2014it can be important to pay attention to specific foods that impact you in a unique way. So in terms of glycemic load, I think if you are eating a moderate- or low-carbohydrate diet, then getting away with two or three meals a day is fine, but you may find that if you're eating a high-carbohydrate diet, or because of your exercise routine, you have very high caloric needs and you're eating say a 100, 200 grams of carbohydrates at a meal, then you may be pushing your ability to handle that load at that one meal. And so what I find is that when my caloric needs go up and when my exercise is driving my carbohydrate needs up, I eat more frequently because I find that I feel much better if I'm never really getting over 100 or so grams of carbs, except maybe at night, when I'm eating dinner or before I'm going to bed, where it might knock me out, and I don't really mind. Then the other thing is specific foods. So, you could look up the glycemic index of a variety of foods. You may find some general principles like lentils, for example, a recent study showed that lentils lead to more stable blood sugar than potatoes or rice, but actually this is going to be highly variable from person to person, so I think that if you have a blood sugar problem, you do want to test specific foods and see how you respond, and the only way you can truly gather that data is with trial and error. In terms of symptoms that you might experience, anxiety, tiredness, brain fog, shakiness could all be signs of blood sugar that's too high or too low. Sometimes you get reactive hypoglycemia meaning your blood sugar spikes after or soon after the meal, and then a few hours later, it drops to the low range, and you might be experiencing symptoms like that in either of those cases. The only way to really know is to test with a glucometer. There are many out there. I'm currently using a Precision Xtra because it also measures ketones, and sometimes I like to see that. In terms of how strictly you would need to follow any of these things, I really think it depends on whether you have a blood sugar issue to deal with. So if we look at the normal ranges, you want to keep your blood sugar under 140 milligrams per deciliter postprandial, which means in the hours after you eat a meal, and there could be arguments that maybe it should be kept even lower than that. If your blood sugar is not highly variable after your meal, or it's not causing you any symptoms, or it's not exceeding that range, then you might not want to worry about these things. But if these things are easy for you to do and implementing them brings your blood sugar to a more stable position even within the normal range, then it's probably a good idea to follow those principles insofar as they seem easy to you because it probably is better to keep your blood sugar more stable when you can while still meeting all your other nutrients and meeting all your other goals. On the other hand, if the way that you eat right now leads to stable blood sugar, then you have nothing to worry about, and I wouldn't go changing your diet around these specific hacks if Signing off, this is Chris Masterjohn of chrismasterjohnphd.com, and this has been Chris Masterjohn Lite.",

        "video_sub_title": "this is the second part of the irrigation packing of the wound I left off where I change the old dressing and did the irrigation now we're going to take right over and usually we do it in a two part just like I'm showing you here we'll do the irrigation clean all that up and then we bring all our sterile stuff up this stuff out to step up so we've got everything ready he's ready to go there again make sure you know the allergies because we're going to be actually packing into the wound in this case our order was saline so we'll be pretty safe with that okay table looks clean and dry it's at my waist level okay my pack looks fine the expert expiration date is good and it'll tell you exactly what you have in here if you don't know it so we're going to open this up toss that now remember if we open the flap away from us first and then the flaps to the side and then the last one will come ports and there's the one-inch margin that you can actually touch and you see how they're dropping down to the side those member down there I consider contaminated my one inch margin starts up here and I'm moving this down because in just a little bit I'm going to have to put my sterile gloves on and I need a room across here okay I'm going to go ahead and open my bottle and the exploration is good on it it hasn't been open more than 30 days left there okay now when we open this up there's a pair of gloves in it and they're latex free which is good mesh down on it so to lift up so when you take these out you won't contaminate what's there so reach in and take them out didn't you want to come and this is why I want this part of the table clear because what I'm going to do is actually open my gloves here across here if I open them on top of here I just contaminated my field so open them here where you can actually get to it and you still have the one-inch margin okay I'm right-handed so I'm going to pick my right and blow up and I'm going to put it on all right now before I do anything else what I want to do is reach over and I'm going to go straight down this alley and get my say Lane because what I need to do is take my snow hand and remove stuff out of one of the compartments that I'll need because I'm going to put my solution in there and I'm going to move this to the edge so I'm not coming way over it with my arm so I'm going to hold about one to two inches of course I'm sailing in come back down the alley here back right there not over the field so that's ready to go now so I look around I'll be able to pack all the things that I need so I'm ready to put my second glove on I'm going to hold onto my paper go under the cup when I actually get ready to put my glove on I'm going to hitchhike with that thumb just grab the center the palms of my hands there now what I want to do is I want to go ahead and step back off my field and look at what I got here I know from what I see there I'm going to need one two pack so I'm going to go ahead and open that up and fluff it out a little bit makes it easier to actually do the packing and go ahead and put that in I'm going to need a couple to put over it and a couple to actually dry the Perry wound again because I want to keep that Perry wound that's the good tissue around that wound so it's sterile or excuse me not still clean and dry okay now I've got to stay out of that one inch margin remember here I'm going to take out and what I might need is my q-tip which is here and what I also might need is my abd pad to put it over so I have everything that I need and looking at that and just from experience I know one of these four by fours is going to do the job for me okay I'm going to reach in I'm going to squeeze the excess out and I don't want to hold for over my feel so that's why I've stepped over the garbage can here now you want to fluff this out there we go now you can either use the q-tip some people will use their fingers keep this in your hand because if this drags on the skin it's contaminated and we'll have to start over again okay so I want to go ahead and pack this in and you want to pack it up underneath the edge there and one of the things about packing is you want to be sure and not pack it too tight but you want to get it up underneath of there enough that you're covering the part that may access over if it starts healing from the top instead of a bottom out the other thing is you don't want to have a really high dressing here when you've got a big lump because it puts pressure down on that particular wound bed and causes more problems be careful I'm always wary about using a q-tip like this because if they jump I could poke them not intentionally okay now that's all in if you see the Perri room does not have any of that on the outside now I want to take this and go from top and clean toss and go and clean again all I'm doing is drying that to keep it dry now what I want to do is take these two four by fours here lay over it take my abd pad and by the way now we don't have to be sterile here because the outer dress is not sterile I'll put that on now unless you're in isolation you can take your gloves off and then hopefully you look to see what they were allergic to and know which tape to use and again just tab in the end here and depending on where this is that is how you do your dressing take your dressing very dressing is a little bit different the thing that I say to you when you get through make sure the patient's okay with the way you've got it taped otherwise they may try to untape it and redo it and then the last part here is you want to autograph it remember your initials the date the time that you actually did the trick the dressing change okay now at this point I would ask them get them repositioned get them turned back over on their back see if they're comfortable how they're doing can I get them anything else if they're fine just reposition them get the call light and reach put the bed back down if I put the bed up I'm taking put their over bed stand back next to them and put their water their telephone whatever it is that they want their this stuff the Saline left here goes into the commode report there and all of this gets thrown into the garbage any drainage in that bag that bag needs to be pulled out and taken to the soil utility room where the biohazard stuff is kept once you get through with that and cleaning this up be sure and wash your hands and then go out and document your Rita and your salt",

        "video_sub_title": "hi this is Josh I'm a pharmacist with pharmacist tips calm today I'm gonna talk to you a little bit about how to stop taking the medication omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor what does that mean it reduces stomach acid reduces stomach acid secretion it's available in the US under the brand name Prozac it's available generically and then by far most of the sales occur with the generic the over the OTC or over-the-counter form is indicated for two weeks or less how long you're supposed to use that prescription insert tells you it should be used for four to eight weeks oftentimes we see it used for much longer than that and then it makes it difficult to quit after your body used to this medication some of the common uses just to have a full background here of MF Rizal again I want to emphasize that it's the literature suggest we should use it for the shortest time possible two to four weeks GERD or gastroesophageal reflux disease may take eight weeks of treatment ulcer treatment one or two months h pylori that's an infection in the stomach you usually take proton pump inhibitors along with typically a couple antibiotics like amoxicillin and clarithromycin something like that for two weeks prevention when you're using it for prevention like if you're taking certain medications or if you have certain conditions that require you have hypersecretion of acid you may need to take these long-term these medications can help prevent serious long serious conditions from occurring however if you're only taking it for a short term you know sometimes you get stuck on me is and you really don't need to be taking them long-term erosive esophagitis that's one of those long-term conditions where you may need to use it for years and said protection that's where you're taking like ibuprofen naproxen diclofenac a total lack you know something like that and you're gonna take the mep result to help protect your stomach and again that's probably going to be that's one of those situations where you're simply going to have to use this long term especially if you're at higher risk of a bleeding ulcer so there simply are situations where that long-term therapy is going to be needed so what are some of the long-term risks that seem to be associated with a MEP result well it seems like it may increase the risk of fracture so weakening bones over time and again this is when you're on it long term we're talking years and years here increased risk of certain kind of infections like pneumonia or a serious colon infection called c-diff it may it seems like it may cause low levels of magnesium in the body you know because stomach acid is important it's there for a reason and it helps with the absorption of certain vitamins and things the proper breakdown of food so that your body can fully utilize them so it seems like magnesium vitamin b12 is not absorbed properly and iron and calcium seem to need that acidic environment of the stomach and when we take that away through prescription therapy or over-the-counter therapy you just can't optimize the levels of those in your body so how does one wean themselves off of MEP resolve because it's hard to stop if you're on a map result and you've tried to stop it's been shown an acid rebound can occur that means your acid production could come back even more than it was before you started on this but you can mitigate this it is something you can do so if you're on the prescription for it is you'd want to go to the 20s and again if you're taking the prescription form of omeprazole you'd want to talk to your physician or your healthcare provider explain to them you want to go off this medication and they'll help you to determine whether you have a long-term risk where you're better off taking this or if it is a good idea to try and get you off of this then I'll once you're down to the 20s typically you're gonna try to go every other day with this medicine and if you can if symptoms are too bad on that day you're not taking it you can take an h2 blocker or antacids on the alternate day so you would do omeprazole one day and an h2 blocker like ranitidine or famotidine the next day leprous all and so on and then after a few weeks you can go to every third day you can members all ranitidine ranitidine omeprazole and continue to slowly wean yourself off of that so that hyper acidity is not so terrible something that you can live with okay and then once once your every third day you can try switching entirely to an h2 blocker like I said that's ranitidine or famotidine or some of the most common ones that we see folks use and they interesting thinking h2 blockers is h2 means as a histamine to receptor actually may work better for certain nighttime symptoms certain nighttime acid symptoms because sometimes histamine is involved with that so that's a something kind of interesting to keep in mind you slowly want to decrease the dose of then your h2 blocker to every other day using antacids antacids we're talking about toms we're talking to those little chalky tablets Rolaids those chewable antacids immediately neutralize the acid in the stomach and then we're gonna you know do the same sort of thing every third day and then we really want to try and stop that once we're stopped and off of it we can keep antacids on hand for flare-ups and if you're just not able to stop or your symptoms are terrible you want to follow up with your doctor make sure there's no long term condition there something more serious going on just to be evaluated so lifestyle changes we want to stay off of this once you get yourself off you want to keep yourself off of it weight loss is a big one I know everybody groans when I mentioned that but that's how I got rid of my heartburn I you know I hated to admit it but I needed to lose about 15 pounds and once I did my acid stomach went away my heartburn disappeared so it's I know it's easy to take a pill but at the same time you feel better when you lose that weight and it's nice not to be dependent on a medication avoid eating a couple hours two to three hours before bedtime that just having that food in the stomach and then you lay down can kind of push on the esophagus and come up to bite you when you're trying to go to sleep so stop smoking again one of those hard ones but man you can really freak of health conditions and symptoms when you break free from that habit that's another one I know that's hard to break but man when I finally kicked it whether it would have feeling stress management life is stressful we're busy we got jobs we got kids we got bills it's all stressful so we need to try and manage that and you know one of the big things is watching what we eat it's easy to just grab some garbage and shove it down your throat and you don't feel good afterwards you get a momentary enjoyment out of that snack food but in the long run it makes you feel worse so just try to make a few better decisions and your choice of food throughout the day learn some simple breathing techniques there's a lot of real easy apps out there simple box breathing maybe take a yoga class you know whatever just a few minutes of calm man can do a lot for you quality sleep related to that stress if we get some good sleep not only we're gonna make better food choices during the day it's been shown we're gonna be more likely to exercise and it also less acid problems so you owe it to yourself I mean you owe it to yourself to get some good sleep and feed yourself well so you feel good I mean a lot of this can be managed I know it's hard it's the easy choice but in the long run you're gonna do yourself a favor if you really think about some of these lifestyle things elevating your bed six inches off the floor the head of the bed can help you know because then it's less likely to come back up the esophagus and if you do need to use over a counter on MEP rizal no more than 14 days just like the labels even though it comes in a box with enough there for three weeks if you read the label it says you should use it from no more than fourteen days try and stick to that and then you won't have such a hard time getting off of this medication alright I appreciate you watching my video I hope the information was useful to you again if you have chronic symptoms talk to your health care provider we want to make sure there's nothing serious going on no sort of problems with your esophagus or ulcers or some other stomach issues and I'd really appreciate it if you subscribe to my channel and thanks again for watching",

tried format of our bottom two for this she can write reparation so what I am trying to show you the fresh form of this form so we are going to take around 50 gram of our rainbow in a dry form this is how it would look in the dried form our and poo is helps to reduce the body heat and also it reduces the tantra in your scalp and also it helps so clean and condition the scalp and hair and also it

way this is called a sweaty way this is raw waiting a lot of people might not have seen this very well and this very way is predominantly used in lot of spa treatments and also in lot of massages and other things it's used and also it is used for hair care and other things so this is how the very where is it would look like the speciality of this Betty where is this is actually a root of a plant and this is the only route in the world which has a very good smell for the vegetable oil is used in lot of skincare treatments and hair care treatments and also you will be getting a lot of spa treatments using the vet avail or oil so the wet event naturally he is any wounds or any itching sensation in your scalp it is a natural antiseptic so we are taking around 30 grams of weight away for the sheikah preparation and the next ingredient we are going to use is rose so we are not going to again use the fresh roses we are going to use the dried rose flowers here I have the right rose class I am going to take around 50 grams of this rose right rose petals or the rose flower for the shikaka so it just weighs around 51 grams this one trend doesn't make any difference so we are going to take around 50 grams of this rose flower petals for the sheikah kite preparation and the next ingredient I am going to use for the sheikah kite preparation is nee and this is these are the neem leaves this is how the neem leaf would look like but the neem leaf can be used in a dried format but I haven't tried the neem leaf wrasses so what I am going to do is like for the shikaka powder preparation I am going to use the neem powder directly so this is the mean powder I have taken around 25 grams of new powder this is curry leaf powder so of course you all know that the curry leaves which use for cooking I have taken around under the 25 grams of curry leaf powder you all know hibiscus leaves it would look like this so I have taken the flower leaf from the hibiscus plant so this is hibiscus leaf powder so I have I'm using this also in the powder form you can use the dried form of the leaves along with the sheikah gun but as I have them in the powdered form I'm using this in the powder this is called as Curie slump and knee in Tamil and in English it is called as fall stasis and in Hindi it is called as bringing out leaves this is the fresh form of the leaves most of the people wouldn't have seen this brush mostly we get this in a dried format or in a powder format or in an oil format so the users of this bring garage is like it helps to reverse the gray hair it helps you to darken the hair hair color it helps in stopping the hair loss and also it conditions your scalp so this is most widely used for hair care treatments and also it helps in regrowth of hair if a person is making a paste of this leaf and mixing it with yogurt and applying it on the balls cap this leaves helps to regrow the hair in bald head it also helps to cure premature graying and also it helps to cure dandruff so this leaves are not fully grown now because this is not a season for this least it will be having a small flower like this that is two colours of flowers one is white another one is yellow you can use both the color flower plant for this purpose it is not only used for hair care but also used for skin care also so now we have got the white color plan but you can use the yellow color one also for the for any kind of preparation both the color flowering plant has the same quality we don't have the leaves grown fully because this is not a season it's pretty warm here during the rainy season you can find them to be really big and also very fresh so we managed to get only the small leaves stirring so I am not using again the fresh form of the sleeves I haven't tried them so I'm using the powder of this leaves so the preimage powder would look like this you all know very well because in the previous hair oil preparation also we use this powder but I was not able to show you the leaf or the plant so this is how it would look like the plant so the leaves would be like this the moment you crush the leaves like that if the leaves might turn into black in color I remember those days like even for the teeth whitening these sleeves are used it also helps in whitening the tooth also but anyway regarding the other uses of this curry salon coming on the brain garage I will be having an extensive video about the total users and benefits of this plant as of now we are telling you how it is being used in hair care this is called the scar Booker era see it would be like this they say that this is also one form of rice this is predominantly used in hair care and beauty care treatments so I am going to use this also but we will not be using lot of this will be using very less so I'm going to take around 25 grams of carb over RC for this chicken pie powder preparation so this also helps to maintain your scalp and also condition your hair and it is also good for any kind of informations or infections in your cap this is good for it also this this car boja RC helps you to reduce sink body heat so the next ingredient is basil which is called as policy this is not the regular basis this is called as holy basil the leaf would look like this this is the fresh form of the sea so as I don't have the dried form of the leaves and using the dry powder of d2z and so I have taken the rosy powder which is again 25 grams of fancy color so I have taken the 25 grams of all the powders so the idea is to you have to blend all these ingredients dry ingredients in a blender or different case you have any place where you can blend that this into a nice powder format you can blend them after blending all the whole ingredients whole dry ingredients into a powder you can mix all these powdered ingredients and mix it well in that and you can use that as a shaker guide as the quantity is pretty high and it is dry powder just too difficult to do it at home so I just came by here to the nearby mill where they really blend this into a fine powder we will show you how to prepare a shaker card paste for applying the hair using this powder when you powder this powder you have to be little careful you shouldn't be too fond of fine and also it shouldn't be too coarse you have to have it little coarsely filling in the powder so we will be showing you how to mix this powder to make a chica typist there are few ways in which you can mix the sugar powder the quantity varies based on the thickness of your hair and length of your hair I do have a very short hair that's the reason why I'm taking a little quantity of shikoku powder I'm taking around 4 tbsp of shake acai powder and I really like to use skirt for my hair so I am using Kerr to mix this but if in case you can take a cup of water you can throw in few curry leaves if you have neem leaves you can draw in some neem leaves and you can also throw in some hibiscus flowers and leaves and boil that so that the essence of that leaves would get into the water and you can add that water but I always prefer yogurt and adding yogurt to the sheikah chi powder and you can add a little bit of water and mix it well make sure that it is not having any lumps you have to really really beat it well and you have to allow this mixture to soak for at least three to four hours it is always good if you could do this in the night and in the morning you can use this liquid so it would you can get it soaked for 10 to 12 hours make sure that you're not having any lumps beat it well even after leaving it for three to four hours you beat it well once and then apply it on your scalp because like when you really have lumps and other things it it might get clocked in your hair and it would be too difficult for you to wash it off even after finishing hair worse you might even find the clock staying back in your hair so you have to have a nice pace so keep itself people those who are having Armagh and wheezing shouldn't use chica kyle it would really aggravate the effects of asthma and wheezing for them so they have to be careful they shouldn't use sugar when you mix it it can be little liquidy in a little bit runny texture so that when you take it in the morning when you mix it it will have her right paste consistency and also if you find it to be too thick in the morning you can mix a little bit of water and apply it on your scalp you have to really have it inner Ronnie's texture so this is the right texture to have it on your scalp don't make it too thick like a tight paste from have it more in a running for as I said before if in case you even mixed it with yogurt and you want to really mix it a little bit more with the water then you can have a half a cup of water and throw in some curry leaves a little bit of Amla juice or something like that if you really find the dandruff is is quite a lot then you can add a little bit of aloe vera or lemon juice in that water and coil it and add it to make it so you all know what are the basic ingredients which really helps in hair growth and and in eliminating your dandruff so you can use those in ingredients and make your shake acai paste you can even add on the juice to it or lemon juice to it you can even add curry leaf water or hibiscus leaves water or hibiscus flower water to it and make it as a fine paste you don't need to soak this in your hair for very long time you look you can directly go and apply it on your scalp and lather it and wash it off yet it is not that you have to soak it in your head you can directly apply it and rub it and wash it off whereas you have to soak this mixture for four hours this is the sheik acai powder preparation I hope you guys would be really liking the Schick acai powder preparations do try this at home and share your feedback and comments with us we are looking forward for your feedback and comments and please do share us your feedbacks and comments you really

        "video_title": "Skin Care Tips- Treating HORMONAL ACNE",
        "video_sub_title": "hey guys stop babbling board-certified laser dermatologist before we go onto the video in regards to how they treat hormonal acne I'll give you a sneak peek on what the dermatology office looks like so before most of us recommend products or endorse products or recommend anything will prescribe anything the patients generally speaking most dermatologist with a trial tip on themselves first so we get given things like people of trial kits this one from La Roche Posay so we know what the product feels like on our skin and that's mainly a subjective viewpoint rather than an objective viewpoint so we've got everything from tolerating all the way to discovery kits from a beam the whole lot and generally speaking we can't use the entire plot because we just have given too many stuff so that's the perks of being the dermatologists so let's get into this video the last video I did a few weeks ago was how to treat acne before seeing the dermatologist today's video is more specific in that how to treat hormonal acne now just to clarify things hormonal acne generally speaking occurs in females the male's get it yes we can but generally speaking it's due to and this is the truth and the bollocks there or at least that's how males get hormonal acne how does hormonal acne differ from normal acne well normal acne you'll see actually affects the t-zone area right so that's what we call the forehead area of the nose and usually it has blackheads pustules and zits yeah so that's normal acne what hormonal acne is totally different usually affects the jawline area and the cheeks in occurs usually as the name suggests adult female jawline hormonal acne usually in adults over the age of 25 so statistically 25% so that's 1/4 of females over the age of 25 will suffer from adult jawline hormonal acne right so it's very very common and research has shown that the incidence is actually increasing so just a debunk a few myths some people say hate the hormones we're feeding the chickens or the beef it's a testosterone and that no it's not it's due to partially due to food but it's more complex than that because hormonal acne is due to many factors including genetics so you can't help that it's also due to stress it's also due to foods and it's also due to environmental factors including what would put on our face the makeup you use and the cleansers you use and moisturizers your actives in the whole lot in then there's the hormonal influx which I'll go through later on so why does it occur basically the curse due to all those factors but in the curse at a certain time of your life and it's usually like I said over the age of 25 and they form these deep painful periodic in other words there's a cycle to it it may occur you know within the week of your period cycle and it's usually around the jawline area and you'll see that most patients actually try to squeeze it but you can't squeeze it because they're blind headed pimples which means it's called acne excoriate which means you actually digging into it which may cause scarring so one of the biggest causes of scarring lice is due to hormonal acne now why do you get hormonal acne well like I said it's partly due to everything else it's you can't pinpoint it on one factor so it's generally due to a fluctuation in the hormone cycle so as we grow older as females grow older I mean even males is it's a different flux in regards to testosterone and estrogen so we start off here with testosterone and estrogen and testosterone I mean I mean by androgen so that includes something like testosterone 17 hydroxy progesterone dihydrate at the end Asturian estate in many others okay so these basically bind to receptors on your oil gland activate the oily cause acne so the other upside is that you've got estrogens so as females grow older the flux basically changes your testosterone levels or androgen level 3 androgen levels remain but your test your estrogen levels may drop so that's why you can have acne even at the age of 30 or 40 if you're female because your estrogen levels drop in your free testosterone and androgens remain the same okay the other side of things is that there are many other causes of hormone acne they go well beyond the context of this lecture things like prolactin levels like I said I'm 17 hydroxy progesterone congenital adrenal hyperplasia free testosterone from variant causes in many other causes like I said that goes far beyond this so good dermatologist with generally speaking with check your hormone levels to exclude all the other causes and go how you've got hormone like me so the big question I get is how to treat at how to actually treat hormonal acne well it's difficult because at the end of the day we're treating the hormonal changes now we always start with the basics in the basics of this you start off with non comedogenic products so you most importantly is your makeup so make sure your makeup is something like a mineral makeup and not a liquid foundation because they can clog up pores and make sure you let your skin breathe for at least two days per week okay so that's very important you make up everything else like your sunscreen counts and even your actives see what we're looking for is something called a non comedogenic so something like the ordinary for example I find in excellent I mean if I'm going to do a review on this which I will do shortly this is a look seriously bang for bucks you can't beat this but in this situation it is non community got non comedogenic in other words this can't form acne so the flip side is this it doesn't mean that if you use this but even though this is it has not gotten on caminar genic that you will get acne so trial it up if you get acne stop it but as a rule look for the words non-comedogenic in other words not acne forming but the flipside is that it's not always the case because some non comedogenic products can actually cause acne in some community products do not cause acne so always have a balanced viewpoint because skin is as individual as you are and not just on the packaging there's a biggest hint I can give you guys so you start off with that that doesn't work certainly you can go for your retinoid so you vitamin a you can get it written all over the counter or you can get this which are basically a prescription retinoids yes I know a dappling which is different you can buy over-the-counter in the US but in Australia you do need a script so this can help us well a short course of antibiotics such as doxycycline can help not because we're finding the pustules of P acnes is that because doxycycline is an anti-inflammatory in that short course of doxycycline so timeout for maybe four weeks can actually reduce your inflammation and just break that cycle so antibiotics can certainly help do we like describing any bugs the interest no but can it help some patients the answers yes and it's probably the least invasive of all oral medication that you know we can treat acne with going up from there it's still the basics it's all the ALJ's the alpha hydroxy acids light can help as in photo therapy using blue light and red light because they're anti-inflammatory as well and certainly things like chemical peels and the chemical peels which we like basically the alpha hydroxy acids or even better still the beta hydroxy acids because the BOJ peels anti-inflammatory and they can actually help exfoliate any comedones but remember most of the time you're dealing with deep seeded lesions so that's why don't be destroyed peels and topicals even you're using filing bees and taking supplements such as zinc and all that doesn't help because we're dealing with thieves the hormonal acne which comes from the inside why does can you do before seeing the dermatologist and the answer to diet so as you know hormonal acne can flare up with diet and it's we know why it's not due to the chicken or due to the beef that we eat or the hormones that are fed to them it's due to the fact that refined foods such as ones with high in sugar can actually work through what's known as the IGF so insulin-like growth factor pathway and we know very well now that that foods can actually flare up acne so for example foods high in sugar and also dairy products so if you're a fan of dairy products well you might want to actually go for soy yes it tastes doesn't taste as good but you know it could save you from actually going on medication for acne so here's the crunch line guys for hormonal acne in most situations in 80% of situations you probably do need to see a dermatologist because we are treating you internally so you try everything else for this like I said I'm not for medication in fact I'm an ting medication that's why I don't describe my laser and they do procedure so I'm anti medication but acknowledging that there's some Duma told us out there we'll treat you for hormonal acne and as a result that will treat your hormones to give you that balance so things like the pill whether be Diane because it contains something called soy protein acetate or yes or Yasmin because it contains an anti engine called CRISPR name so what these anti hormones do is they stop your free hormones in other words your androgens remember your androgens are the ones which cause acne from binding to the oil gland which then gives an increase in oil production sebum clogs your pores and gives you acne so one method is to use any hormones second method is actually used in old-fashioned treatment but the actual works really well called spur and I like them and most of Matala I certainly went when I used to be a general dermatology ten years ago that was my favorite treatment for hormonal acne because in my opinion is far safer then accutane so last of all for treating hormonal acne is this which is basically a contain the devil's advocate in other words it's a double-edged sword no one likes describing this no one I think no normal dermatologist likes endorsing it but do we use it yes we do for cases which are either scarring so when you get this picking acne when it comes to hormonal acne wear disguise certainly most good dermatologists would actually move you off the scale of every quickly to actually stop you picking stop the outbreak stop the scarring and get you on track so unlike treating teenage acne or normal t-zone acne where you require you know realistically between twenty to forty to fifty milligrams per day treating hormonal acne with accutane is super easy most patients respond to to the three tablets per week in that way you don't have a lot of the bad side effects such as you know Sun sensitivity dry lips muscle aches pains irregular period cycle - cetera cetera cetera so it's a totally different process so don't be afraid if your dermatologist decides to actually prescribe you this because nothing else works guys I hope that you found that useful I am telling you the absolute truth I've got nothing more to give in regards to hormonal acne okay a good dermatologist would review you if you need investigate you and give you treatment options but like I said before you see your dermatologist tried all those other things first because believe it or not we do not like to prescribe medication we don't need to guys thanks very much for watching this short segment tendered Sigmund hormonal acne and I hope that clarifies in the bumps a lot of myths out there so 80% of the time yes we do need to actually use medication but in 20% of the time it can be cleared up using all the methods I describe guys if you like this please share subscribe and I'll see you the same time same place next week and by all means this is an interactive channel so please leave your comments below happy to respond to them and I'll talk more about acne scarring and how the revised acne scars in the next few weeks catch you then bye",

Doug with a health fixer tip for skin tags skin tags are those little tiny ugly little skin flaps or little skin tags that you'll find on people's necks in their armpit behind their leg anywhere where the skin will crease there's a lot of different causes of it or hypotheses of what causes it is it coming from a heavy metal toxicity is it coming from an area that we sweat or where the skin rubs and friction but today I'm not going to address that I'm going to address exactly how you can treat it at home you can either try alcohol or hydrogen peroxide rubbing it on you have to be very persistent you have to do a couple of times a day day after day and what you're trying to do is see if you can get it to discolor turn a little dark soon it almost turns black and at that point that's actually a good thing because you're a few days from it actually falling off there's another technique that I'll discuss in another video where some people like to tie it off and then let it die out and but for now try the alcohol or peroxide rubbing give it a try",

        "video_title": "Bicep Tendon Rupture - The Most Important Thing To Know",
        "video_sub_title": "hey everybody this is Joshua with the tendinitis expert in this video is out the most important thing about bicep tendon rupture so let's start with where it can rupture so you can get a tear which is just another name for a rupture either partial or complete up at the shoulder on one of the two heads or down at the elbow generally you're not going to have a tear in the muscle it's almost always where tendon meets bone or muscle starts to turn into tendon those are the the weaker spots so the most important thing to know is what actually causes the rupture because your doctor will tell you that well you got a tear right here and so therefore that's the problem and admittedly that is a problem because there's a tear but the cause of that tear is more important and the cause wasn't that you were lifting weights or you were playing sports you're doing pull-ups or lifting beer can or whatever that is what caused rupture what caused the rupture is the overall ecology of the bicep structure and here's the thing about that so we think that so if here's muscle and that turns into tendon then we think that the tendon when it tears it tears because it's a weak and that's not true it is not because the yes terrible it is not because the tendon is weak false the problem is and what causes here is is a lack of function so your house and bicep muscles and your doing whatever you're doing so this muscle is contracting short and long and your forearm is getting pulled this way and then it's let go that way and then you do it again when all that is happening and especially if there's like a barbell that you're lifting for instance to add additional weight then again we think that while the tendon is a weak spot is actually not what is the weak spot is the function of the muscle so the purpose or I should say the job of a muscle is to absorb force so as you're lifting the weight back and forth etc the muscle is performing work and it's absorbing force but here's the problem when a muscle is not functioning very well and one way of saying that is when a muscle is optimal when it's at this link at rest but then over time and use it becomes tight and short so you can imagine that it's missing I don't know 40% of its ability to work right there if this is the new normal right here and then connective tissue shrink wraps over time so you're literally stuck short and tight so not only are you able to do less work over time but you have less force being absorbed and when force the ending absorbed by the muscle where do you think that goes that force has to go somewhere and that force goes to someplace like surprise where tears happen so again it's not that the tendon itself is weak it's that there's too much force going somewhere it's not supposed to go and that is going to cause damage eventually sooner or later and yes you can have tendonitis and yes you not have information of irritation and damage to attending before that happens certainly yes you can have tendinosis which means that the tendons not getting enough circulation so the cells die of starvation and that can make a tendon weak that's true but the most important thing about injury and rupture is that it's not the tendon is not where it tears that is the cause of that there's no accident there's no failing of the tendon if that your structure your mechanism from here to here the ecology was not working correctly you had too much tightness generally going to have chronic inflammation and nutritional insufficiency and that is going to decrease function and that is going to increase risk of damage because that source when you're doing anything at force have to go somewhere if the muscle is not absorbing it then it has to go to a tendon or at that 10 inch attachment or farther up the likeness and a leg is going to father up the leg to a knee or a hip etc or your low back that force goes somewhere we want the muscles to absorb it and when they're not that's where rupture and damage happens so there's that and that really is the cause of tendon rupture it's not the activity is not the wait you know obviously the card drops on you that's going to be its own problem but just normal use and activity and neither than the high level athletics injury doesn't come generally from action injury becomes comes from muscles not working as they should they're not able to perform the amount of work or absorb the amount of force they're supposed to and then you do something and you get a tear because that force goes to a weak the force goes to a spot the force is too much for that spot and then eventually that's going to cause damage so that's the most important thing about bicep tendon rupture not the weak spot the tendons that weak is that the muscle structures are not working properly so if you want to find out more about that go my website tendonitis x-ray comm and find the appropriate page",

fit your body correctly step 1 put one crutch under each arm at the sides of your body while you're standing step 2 relax your shoulders and let your arms hang down over the crutches the crutch pads should not touch your armpits step 3 check the amount of space between your armpits and the crutch pads there should be 2 inches or 5 centimeters of space between them this is about two or three finger widths this space helps keep the crutch pads from putting pressure on nerves and blood vessels in your armpits pressure on these nerves and blood vessels may cause arm tingling and weakness if the crutches are not the right height you can adjust them check the instructions that came with your crutches or contact your health care provider if you're not sure how to do this step four check the

        "video_title": "Child Care & First Aid : How to Treat a Cough",
        "video_sub_title": "It's a bad cough, what do you do? My name is Beverly Bitterman, ARNP, Health and Wellness Consultant and I'm here to give you a few strategies for how to deal with the cough. First of all let's start with why the cough might be happening. Oftentimes the cough is a part of the cold syndrome. Sometimes, it's what's leftover after the cold is gone away or after the flu has gone away. I'll focus my tips on those kinds of conditions and at the end we'll talk about when you need to see a doctor. Right now, let's say that you've got a cough and what you really want to do is sleep through the night. So here's some strategies. I would start with a hot shower or warm bath and if you can, you might even put, they've got some substances you can put in water, now you can buy them in the cold department that have eucalyptus in it. Something that would open up your nose. After you get out of the bath, have a cup of herbal tea or hot lemonade; water lemon juice and honey. Make a nice hot lemonade for a cold. I would consider using a nasal spray if it's really bad. Something like a nasal decongestant, something an Air Fran would be a brand name. You don't want to use this however, more than about three days in a row because you can get rebound stuffiness. So use it according to package directions, but it can help you sleep. Another thing that I like to do is suck on a cough drop, I even keep this by my bedside and use those. They have sometimes eucalyptus in them, they can have honey and lemon, things like that, that help open you up. And another favorite that I've used since I was a child is Vicks and it has a camphor in it and eucalyptus that helps open up your nose. I put a little bit right on top of my lip or on the side of my cheek. And those are some strategies. Sometimes it's well if you sleep on two pillows, it can help a cough. If the cough is persistent, lasts more than a couple of weeks, if you don't know why you got the cough to start with, then, if you're coughing out blood or a lot of sputum with it; if you're coughing, if it's very productive cough, if the productive cause, cough last more than a few days, those would be times that I would recommend that you go on and see your physician for further evaluation. You might need a different prescription medication. Meanwhile, try to keep your nasal passages clear and the mucus down. My name is Beverly Bitterman, ARNP, Health and Wellness Consultant and good luck getting over that cough.",

        "video_title": "How To Tell If It's Coronavirus, The Flu, A Cold, Or Allergies",
        "video_sub_title": "Those of us who suffer from seasonal allergies and hay fever don't really look forward to spring anyway, but thanks to the onset of the COVID-19 coronavirus, every cough, sneeze, or sniffle has become a reason for us, and those around us, to worry. But doctors like Greg Poland, an infectious diseases professor at the Mayo Clinic and director of the Mayo Clinic's Vaccine Research Group, tells CNN that there is a noticeable difference between a seasonal allergy and the coronavirus, particularly if you're experiencing the same symptoms that you do every year. Poland says, \"The issue with seasonal allergies is that they affect the nose and eye. They tend to be nasal, and most symptoms are localized to the head, unless you also experience a rash. The flu and the novel coronavirus, these affect other systems and the lower respiratory tract. You probably won't have a runny nose, but what you might have is a sore throat, a cough, a fever or shortness of breath.\" But bear in mind that not all shortness of breath can indicate coronavirus, because while allergies might not normally trigger a shortness of breath, they could if you have asthma. Dr. Maria Teresa Camacho, the medical director of a pediatric intensive care unit, tells CBS that allergy sufferers shouldn't also expect to see their body temperatures go above normal range. She told the outlet, \"[With] allergies you don't have a fever and usually they are seasonal allergies, you know it's not all the time. You have congestion, but you don't have a fever and body aches.\" Business Insider reports that someone with the virus will have a fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, will sometimes have headaches, aches and pains, a sore throat, and fatigue; but there won't necessarily be any diarrhea and a runny nose is rare. There is no sneezing. Symptoms of a common cold include aches and pains, a sore throat, runny nose, and sneezing. Symptoms of a flu include a fever, a dry cough, headaches, aches and pains, a sore throat, and fatigue. And the most common allergy symptoms are a runny nose, sneezing, and shortness of breath. It may be a bit more of a challenge to work out the differences between COVID-19, a cold, and a flu though, because as Poland says in a separate interview with CNBC that the cold and flu have similar symptoms to the coronavirus. But if you have all the flu symptoms and you can't breathe, it may be a good idea to get tested as quickly as possible if you're able. NBC News medical correspondent Dr. John Torres calls it a \"tell-tale sign\": \"If you start getting shortness of breath, that's definitely a sign to go to the hospital.\" Sandra Kesh, a New York-based infectious disease expert tells CNBC, \"Based on what we know so far, [for most people] it will probably be like when you're laid up in bed with the flu. You'll start to feel sick, symptoms get worse until they peak, and then they gradually go away.\" The WHO has said that coronavirus, unlike allergies, can go from mild or moderate to severe very quickly. Poland tells CNN, \"If you have an acute case of coronavirus or flu, you will feel so tired, so achy, you'd basically be driven to bed. Everybody would see the difference. Allergies may make you feel tired, but they're not going to cause severe muscle or joint ache.\" The infection usually starts in the nose, and once the virus is inside your body, it attacks the cells that protect your respiratory system. If the virus stays in the region of your upper airway, then Jeffery Taubenberger, who has studied infection in Spanish flu victims, tells Fortune that you're not likely to get as sick. But if it goes down your windpipe and into your lungs, it can cause pneumonia; it can also trigger your body's immune system, which is capable of creating more damage. Taubenberger says, \"Your body is immediately trying to repair the damage in the lung as soon as it's happening. Normally, if this goes well, you can clear up your infection in just a few days.\" The downside to your body healing itself so efficiently is that your immune system ends up damaging the cells responsible for protecting the lower respiratory tract, and as a result, Taubenberger says the lungs become vulnerable to a second bacterial infection caused by germs that normally live in our noses, throats, and in mechanical ventilators. Bottom line? Monitor your symptoms carefully, and take all necessary precautions to prevent potentially spreading disease to others, including maintaining social distancing and regularly washing your hands thoroughly. Symptoms vary from person to person, but if you're getting worse instead of getting better over the course of a few days, seek medical attention.",

        "video_sub_title": "my name is Ed Loftus I'm a physician at Mayo Clinic and I'm chair of the inflammatory bowel disease interest group here in the division of gastroenterology and hepatology and I wanted to talk to you today about ulcerative colitis the medications we use to treat all sort of colitis aren't really directed against the root cause of the condition they're directed against decreasing inflammation in the lining of the bowel in a somewhat nonspecific way and we use a variety of medications there are the sulfasalazine and five amino salicylate class of medications and these are really the mainstay of treatment and ulcerative colitis these medications are widely prescribed for this condition and can often get a patient back into a full clinical remission meaning a resolution of their symptoms when these medications aren't effective we will sometimes prescribe corticosteroids also known as steroids for short these aren't the steroids that you hear about athletes taking these are steroids that reduce inflammation prednisone is a good example of those these work well in the short term but can over time can result in side effects when prednisone is not sufficient to control the symptoms we'll move on to other classes of medications one of those is a Sofia Prynne were a cousin of a Sofia brain called six mercaptan Perrine or another cousin called methotrexate now a methotrexate we don't use so much in ulcerative colitis but it has been used by some these medications modulate the immune system they suppress the immune system slightly and can result in reduced inflammation they're a little bit more complicated to use than the five amino salicylate class of medications and too often require blood count monitoring and and similar types of more closely followed monitoring when this class of medication is not effective then we will often move to anti-tnf therapy or biologic therapy and the most commonly used agent for ulcerative colitis in this class is infliximab also known as Remicade and this has been shown in a number of studies to be effective for some patients with more severe forms of ulcerative colitis when medical therapy is not effective at controlling symptoms or if a patient develops precancerous changes in the colon then will sometimes recommend surgery surgery and ulcerative colitis usually involves removing the colon and the rectum and nowadays this can be done by some surgeons including some here at Mayo in a laparoscopic or minimally invasive fashion and this has been shown to reduce the post-operative recovery from surgery so that some people are getting out of the hospital only for 2 4 or 5 days after their colectomy and we're seeing pretty good results with that they are now doing a procedure called incision list proctocolectomy where a person can have the colectomy with basically no open incision just a few incisions for the laparoscopic ports of course surgery is it's a big step but for some patients if medications are failing this can result in a significant improvement in their quality of life listen we found that over a 30-year period that approximately 25 percent of ulcerative colitis patients will go on to require surgery for their condition but most patients do not require colectomy life expectancy of patients with ulcerative colitis is actually longer than that of people in the general population the reason for that is there's a curious relationship between cigarette smoking and ulcerative colitis and it turns out that most people with ulcerative colitis either never smoked or quit smoking and it's unusual to see people with true ulcerative colitis who are active cigarette smokers so there's something in cigarette smoke that seems to suppress bowel inflammation at least within the case of ulcerative colitis now that doesn't mean we go out and recommend the people that they take up cigarette smoking but this might explain why the life expectancy of people with ulcerative colitis is actually a little bit longer than that in the general population in terms of medications we talked about the sort of standard medications but there are a number of clinical trials investigational trials of newer agents that were always involved in and many of these novel drugs are monoclonal antibodies that block various aspects of the mucosal inflammatory reaction and thereby reduce inflammation and reduce symptoms so in any given time we have three or four of these trials ongoing and many patients who come here find that there they are candidates for some of these investigational studies in many ways it's it's difficult to categorize patients with ulcerative colitis with respect to the severity and many patients ask us what should I look forward to in the future with my colitis and what we found over the years that the natural history of ulcerative colitis is quite fluctuating and so a person may have a bad one to two years but then we'll they'll often go into it prolonged clinical remission and do well for several years it's it's fairly unusual to see somebody develop ulcerative colitis and go into a prolonged remission for forever and so the this type of a disease is chronic illness is characterized by flares and periods of remission often times when people come to our clinic they'll come in on a Monday and over a rapid period of time usually two to three to four days we can complete a battery of tests and see them back the same week with with a global overview of what we think is going on with their inflammatory bowel disease right then and there and we can often get them in to see the necessary consultants and other specialties if necessary",

        "video_sub_title": "so how does one really know if they're deficient in bile what is bile bile is a detergent okay it helps you break down the fats that helps you break them down and it helps you extract the fat side of vitamins and other essential fats like omega-3 fatty acids without bile you can't pull those into the body but bile does a lot more than that it helps keep your microbial balance in check it helps keep the fat from building up in the liver it helps remove toxic waste through the body it helps eliminate the excess of cholesterol that your body doesn't need it even helps lubricate the colon to allow food to go through the body a lot easier so number one if you're deficient you're gonna usually be low in one of the fat soluble vitamins so vitamin A there's a lot of symptoms but one would be you can't see in the dark too well you're driving you can't see at night too well vitamin D deficiency bone pain lowered mood because one of the symptoms of vitamin D is depression between lower immune system it could be many different things psoriasis is will be one and if you're low in vitamin E which is the fat side of a vitamin you might have dry skin you may have hot flashes chest pain but the big one is weak muscles because without vitamin E you just don't have the level of oxygen for the muscles to work effectively and then vitamin k1 you'll get bruising vitamin k2 you can have a lot of issues you could have kidney stones you can have calcified arteries you could have high blood pressure from that you can even have calcium deposits in your joints alright number two jaundice okay you start looking a little yellow and the whites of the eye and even the skin 3 is constipation why because bio lubricates the colon now if you have too much bile you get diarrhea by the way and as a side note if you have diarrhea you don't want to take bowel cells because that'll make it worse alright number four you could develop a fatty liver if your bile deficient also bloating because bile helps you digest fad so if you're getting undigested fat stuff is gonna sit there longer and you're gonna feel more bloated you might burp and belch that's a sign of a sluggish gallbladder all right number six your stool floats why because you're not digesting fat and the fat ends up in your stool and it will flow or your stool is light-colored you may develop gall stones as a symptom of a bile deficiency because bile is there to help prevent gall stones now why would you be deficient in the first place well maybe you're on a low-fat diet you're not consuming saturated fats that are the stimulus to release bile or let's say you have a fatty liver because bile is made from your liver it's stored in the gall butter but it's made from the liver so if there's damage in the liver either fatty liver it's inflamed or you have cirrhosis that could be why you're not producing the bile or let's say you don't have a gall bladder it was removed well you're gonna be bile deficient in which case you need to take some bile salts after the meal all right no gut bacteria or a lesser amounts of gut bacteria your bacteria is there to help you recycle bile over 90 percent of the bile in your body is recycled and when you eat your body is very efficient in recycling this bile over and over and over to extract more and more of these nutrients from the food that you're eating so we really need this gut bacteria for that or let's say you have a damaged GI system where you have scar tissue in the colon and guess what that's going to create the lack of absorption of bile salts so you don't have that for recycling anymore because only a little bit of it's getting through so whether you have Crohn's or irritable bowel syndrome or some past damage with your GI tract that could limit your bile in which case you might need to substitute and take some vile to achieve the right amounts all right guys see in the next video so if you're enjoying this content go ahead and share it with someone that could really benefit from it",

        "video_sub_title": "okay next we're gonna do crutch fitting this is for an athlete who is not able to walk or build weight either on their foot their knee their hip or needs assistance walking we're gonna fit Kati furred for two crutches for this simulation we are gonna say that who she has injured her right ankle so this would be after the assessment you did you evaluation and she needs to rest it or be mobile so the crutches common in different types we can get wooden crutches or aluminum crutches and for this one we will use aluminum crutches you always want to check the crutch to make sure it has adequate pads and at the top and the bottom to make inspect them to make sure that there's no tears or they're worn I also want to check the pads on the hands to make sure that those are good and the schools are good for these aluminum crutches they they do have the height settings on there so you can ask the patient how tall she is five seven so this currently is that f55 so with these all we need to do is just push the button in and just slide it down turn it slightly and then pull it down to five seven make sure it locks before we test it okay once the crutches ready we also want to make sure that we had a gait belt on and this gait belt will you run and that'll its applied so we will use that to hold on to to a sister rather than having to hold on to her pants or add to her shoulder for assistance so I'm gonna help Katie out okay once she gets into a standing position I'm gonna have her just stand up as straight as possible and we're gonna put the crutch tip 6 inches forward about six inches over to the outside and she's going to put that under her armpit then she's gonna put the pad of her hand he'll over hand onto the crutch pad and actually want to make sure that there are about two to three inches of space under between the armpit top the armpit and the top of the crutch which there is the last thing we want to check I'm gonna turn just a little bit QT we want to make sure we the elbow is bent at about 25 to 30 degrees and if not we can adjust this I'm also going to flip this around Katie so that we have the screw facing forward so it doesn't cut her okay and again once that's fine then I'm going to grab the other crutch and again jut make quick adjustments to this make it the same height make sure the hand this is second one down and then for this one Allah move this six inches up in six inches over and again just check the elbow to make sure that it's been at about 25 to 30 degrees which it is next you want to instruct the patient when she's standing on the crutches okay make sure that she's using the not her her shoulders because she can develop crutch palsy a neurological condition by pinching the nerves under the armpits make sure that she's putting all the weight on the palms of her hand as well as sharing the weight on the good leg which which is her left leg we also want to make sure when she starts walking to tort to make sure that she just takes a normal stride okay which is about a foot or two in front of her and we're gonna be doing several different gait patterns but another thing I want to mention is the settings on the crutches you you don't always want to rely on those just like you always want to make sure that it meets the criteria with the elbow bent and the finger placement all right cuz home court some crutches do not have those numbers if everything's fine there then we're gonna next we're going to do have Katie do a three-point pattern where she's gonna bring the crutches forward and while I'm supporting holding onto the gait belt in the back and she's going to bring the crutches forward and then she's going to bring the good foot to the crutch while the injured foot is for someone that was non-weight-bearing at this point that's a swing too so again she's gonna take another step when she's raised crutches forward two crutches forward swing to next one she's going to swing through so she would advance both crutches at the same time and swing through with normal gait okay and we're going to go ahead and turn back and do that a couple times Katie go ahead and swing through forward swing through touch this forward swing through crutches forward three two more okay then go ahead and turn them off next we're gonna have Katie do a 4-point gate this is for someone who is partial weight bearing so for this one again holding on to the gait belt what she's gonna do for this one is she's gonna bring the the crutches forward with the injured foot at the same time so go ahead and do that and then she's going to swing through with the good foot so with the bad foot she's gonna go crutches and and bad for it at the same time again just shoulder or just a stride width and then swing through crutches and foot forward and then swing through with the good foot crutches in foot swing thrill touches influence swing through and those are the two gait patterns or three gait patterns for the crutches",

tone is a little different as long as it starts with  the inner corner is well lit and the color gets darker as the eyelid grows ok, that is, we go from light to dark told brown people concluded in this case it cannot be marked because otherwise it will give the impression that the body is dropped even later than  it's paulo andr\u00e9 fallen so you have to be well informed I'm only going to use eyeshadows in this palette so all I know that in this press conference will be on the floor blog with which we're making a little corner with brown too to help the smoky effect ok  because the secret of this eye is really the corner of the moment when the pope is rolling around, right and we are also chatty that day you are not funny right he swam and super truck press the agency b  it's thick if it's not your case making a thin player and it ends up a little thicker a super truck to raise your eye in the case of let\u00edcia you can also take advantage of this tip I made it all a little thicker and in the end it's fine for me  leaving it very evident at the end of the eyelid, you can see it, so it seems that the child is going up towards the eyebrow because we thickened the end, you can see this effect well, there you can darken the root of the eyelashes with us but be careful not to get it  the wedding scheduled I'm using the pigment from the burrow of nature and 105 goals just in the inner corner of the eyelid to illuminate more light enters the look now comes an interesting trick false eyelashes this is the natural 2 of the strength that we are and we start when  it really helps and the end at the outer corner of the eyelid ends on the skin that's right, that is, we start with it very close to the root of the eyelashes and ends on the skin to give the impression that the eye lifted it up at the end you can see that it took two floors to remove the one we put on a lot of mascara, it's like this, it's mending the other one it's a super valid trick to leave the child but crooked at the time of gluing here's the tip I prepared the skin it has a clasp  da nf and now I'm using a little bit of my concealer da trata o Claro to correct the goalkeeper whenever I tap him and with the cs 13 brush from my kit amarilys preparing the skin I break the news with the infallible midfield foundation da l'  or\u00e9al color 605 with two drops of 612 we're training and I'm seeing it, besides that, financial is still learning through its line too exclusive to see a little rich contour I made it with the cappuccino from panvel that the black skin itself is just to stay a little bit is for the girls to leave a little more photogenic then we could have a little music right but it's just that this youtube story doesn't release any music from work  for example, let's go in search of a little bit of contour on the nose in which the blush is all pink from the palette itself and how to lighten the pain is a pink eyeshadow that is also on the palette that some people launch in the measure to use on apples is neither too much nor too little it looks super charming and now I'm going to finish the eye of the legend that's when the girls get upset with me it's full because it's really the technique we use to leave the eye but it's not there yet  absolutely nothing under the mascara liner anyway 14 minutes at most but as Let\u00edcia has an eye for it the ideal is clear in my eye so small I'm going to get a little bit of eyeshadow it's the purple one at the bottom showing a little bit of the player on the inside but  I realize that it's all very subtle, right, people, so you don't feel too heavy to look and leave the entire effect on the upper eyelid, a little bit of pencil in the day, on the waterline, too, to help open the eyes between a little more light, right? finalized committed give us the option of the law even to leave the eye well highlighted and look how beautiful she turned out a super eye in so beautiful can't be missed is

        "video_sub_title": "This is our friend James. James doesn\u2019t wear daily disposables, so he\u2019ll need to clean his lenses. Cleaning his lenses will prevent them from deteriorating prematurely, and most importantly, prevent infections. Well James, are you ready to learn how to clean and store your contacts overnight? Ok then, here we go. Here\u2019s what you\u2019ll need: a solid colored towel, lint-free if you have one, multi-purpose lens solution, and of course your contact lens case. First, begin by thoroughly washing and drying your hands. Then, place your towel over the sink to keep your lens from going down the drain if you drop it. Next, remove one of your contact lenses and place it in the palm of your hand so it looks like a tiny bowl. When cleaning your lenses, remember: Squeeze a little solution onto your lens and gently rub your finger back and forth over the lens for about fifteen seconds. Pick up your lens by pinching the sides together. Then squirt your solution over the lens and let it rinse both the inside and outside. Then, soak. Place the lens into your clean, dry case and squeeze enough solution over the lens until it\u2019s covered. Put the cap on the lens case and let your lens soak in the fresh solution. The caps should indicate whether they\u2019re for the right or left lens. Nice work, James. Now repeat the process for your other lens. It takes about six hours for the solution to clean your contacts, so letting them sit overnight is perfect. Good job James, and goodnight. Morning, James. Same clothes, I see. Ah, fresh, clean lenses. After you\u2019ve put your contacts in, you\u2019ll want to discard the solution left in your case from the previous night. Now squeeze a little solution into each cup and gently rub your finger around inside. Discard the solution and rinse with fresh solution one last time. Leave your case out, upside down with the caps off to air dry throughout the day. This way you\u2019ll have a clean, dry case to put your lenses back into tonight. You\u2019ll also want to make sure that you replace your case at least every three months for the healthiest peepers possible. Congratulations, James. You are officially a contacts cleaning pro.",

        "video_title": "How to Treat Adult ADHD: Laugh, Exercise, Sleep, Repeat",
        "video_sub_title": "one day I hope I can meet a handsome man who can sit sill, follow the rules and complete tasks in a consecutive order... said no interesting woman ever. hey Dan here and in this video we're looking at six things you can do that will have a tremendously positive impact on your life if you have adult ADHD. Yes, most of these will help with children as well with ADHD but I find that a lot of these are more of a struggle with adults. I work a lot with entrepreneurs with self-employed people and things like the first thing you can be doing can actually be a big struggle for us and so that number one thing is to have positive relationships. I call this hugs and handshakes I have something up on my wall that I made that says just that and it's a reminder to get out and spend positive time with friends.  Now for those of us who grew up in North America and are programmed to think pills are the solution to everything it's kind of weird to think like how does going out and having some beer with your friends or, you know, spending some time cuddling with your partner watching a movie.. how the heck does that treat ADHD? hell if I know but it does and it does sort of make sense though if you really think about it like ADHD part of what shows up with it is a lack of or abundance of or just generally issues with dopamine serotonin and a few other neurotransmitters and that creates problems for us and so things like hugging someone affects our brain chemistry. It seems funny like we think oh you need pills for everything but it really isn't the case so spending time out with friends in larger groups going out and laughing with a group of friends watching a funny movie go to a comedian with friends while having some drinks after oh my god that's just like the be-all and end-all by the way I'm not encouraging drinks and in all these examples I just happened to be in Spain right now and that seems to be what everyone does. The second thing you can do which will reduce the negative symptoms of adult ADHD is to reduce electronics reduce your social media remember that first thing where I said to spend time with your friends I don't mean you know Instagram Anisha I mean go out see each other in real life at the very least get on a video call or a phone call but that's still not nearly as good as being in the flesh with people so reduce your electronics this is a no brainer really as we all know if you spend a day on social media browsing random stuff online except my youtube channel my youtube channel has been shown and double-blind placebo studies to actually cure all diseases so everything but my YouTube channel will have a negative effect on you so most things electronic will have a negative impact on you this is one reason I use a paper planner and I know it might seem ridiculous but I do actually think that a lot of people with ADHD prefer things in the physical world around us I actually have a theory that we're more like the properly evolved people who would be really good hunters and survive in the wild and all that kind of thing and like people who just love living on their laptops or more the ones who may be you know wouldn't survive the Lions and stuff but not gonna get into that theory right now but it is something where I find the more I do with paper things like whiteboards I tend to walk around and pace when I think if I'm on a phone call and this is very common with people with ADHD we like physical things and electronic things not only does it have all the downsides you've probably heard about like notifications are distracting and it can be addicting and all that but I think it pulls us out of our environment and there's a lot of negative consequences to that now it is 2020 so saying hey reduce your electronic is harder now than it has been in the past I totally get that but look at ways you can set limits and look at ways you can do things differently I'll give you some examples of this of how I do it within my own business I mentioned using a paper planner the other thing that I will do is if I have team meetings I will often do them on my phone rather than sitting in front of a computer and go for a walk so they won't be video calls I'll just call up a member of my team we'll talk as I go walk around you know go walk down to the beach or walk around the city things like that I find at least reduce the amount of time I need to be in front of the screen so as an entrepreneur yes there's certain things that I need to do that require me to be connected but I try to really minimize that as much as I can if there's things where I can do it by pen and paper I'll sometimes go out to a cafe and just bring a pen and paper and be like all right let's plan out this book or let's plan out this video by hand then I can go type it up on the laptop or go film it or something but just trying to keep the time like to as few of hours as possible which still often ends up being six or eight hours a day which is definitely not ideal but it is you know the world we live in the next thing that will have a huge impact on your ability to focus and to execute and to make good decisions is sleep we still don't know all the details on what sleep is actually for and what it does for us but we do know that it does a lot to balance our brain chemistry and a good night's sleep will set you up to focus to make good decisions and will do a lot to alleviate the symptoms of ADHD a bad night's sleep will make everything exponentially worse I know I might be a little bit privileged with this but my rule is I don't use an alarm sometimes have a backup alarm like if I have meetings at 11:00 or noon but generally I do not use an alarm I let my body figure out how much sleep I need and have that amount of sleep and there'll be times where I get up after six hours and I'm alright I'm up I'm good to go and there'll be times where I need ten hours but what I've realized is the days when I don't have enough sleep sometimes the first day will actually be pretty good but then I'll notice the next day when I've started tracking my results is the day after a bad night's sleep won't actually be very good I'll have a lot of brain fog and trouble focusing and trouble really getting things done and so this is something that I've noticed has made a big difference it also plays a huge role in aging and Alzheimer's and all that so I'm thinking all right I'll be mentally healthier for longer I'll probably live longer I'll get more done I'm just gonna sleep more and whatever you got to do to make that happen I know there's probably a million excuses but try to make it happen it will make a really big difference maybe right now you work ten hours a day what if you worked eight hours a day but we're more focused and productive and more effective with your work because you were sleeping more try it out is all I'm saying the next area that has a huge impact on is diet and supplements I can probably do a whole nother video on this and I probably will actually do a whole nother video but the very basics here try to have more healthy fat and more protein try to have less as minimum as possible of refined carbohydrates things like white breads sugars are really bad that includes juices and sodas if you're still doing that stop it has a really negative impact not only in your health overall but your mental health and ability to focus I've experimented with this a lot in terms of diet I've done things like the keto diet generally I try to minimize wheat especially and carbohydrate sugar these sorts of things it definitely does have a positive effect now one thing would diet and this actually applies to everything I'm covering in this video including relationships and exercise and sleep and all that is that these things aren't necessarily as instant as taking a pill if you take a pill you might right away notice something and say okay wow this works I can focus now some of these other things have build-up effects with exercise the first time and that's the next one so I kind of ruined the whole surprise of what number five will be but with exercise the first time you exercise you might have a bit of a high from it where you can focus more and get more done but each time it tends to get better and what actually happens and there's a great book on this called spark and it talks about the effect exercise has on the brain and over time it changes the wiring of your brain so you get exponentially better results the more and more you exercise and that can be the same thing with diet if you just don't eat wheat and sugar for one day you're not gonna suddenly be like wow I can do everything I'm the focus monster but over time you will notice it gets better and better it can be the same thing when it comes to spending time with friends and people you care about I'll have a few days where I'm just working at home and I'm working alone and I'm actually being quite productive and I think yeah maybe I don't need to go out just get this work done and it's always around big two or three where I just crash in terms of my productivity my ability to focus just massively crashes it's like you can get away with it forbid it same with healthy eating I can get away with a few days of maybe eating pizza and wheat unhealthy things but pretty soon that focus crashes the brain fog comes in just feels like I just can't execute things I can't just sit down and make myself do things that is a consequence of not following these healthy habits ultimately so don't think like just because one day you don't sleep well and you get work done or one day you eat really crappy food and you're still able to focus and don't have any brain fog don't think oh this stuff doesn't matter the effects of these things are compounding and long-term and I know that makes it a little harder to implement because you don't get that instant kick but if you track things like brain fog and focus and moon and all that you'll notice a gradual improvement and a consistent improvement if you follow as many of these best practices as you can that of course leads me to number five which air two gave away which is exercise but the type of exercise here is really important and it's a lower intensity cardio exercise for a long time I didn't intentionally ever do cardio I love to run I have probably since I was maybe 20 or so and actually that was a way that I was self-medicating ADHD without realizing it I'd like to go for runs but I never did it like in a routine way when I go to the gym I would just do weights and things I never thought there was a big benefit of cardio I was obviously wrong okay I will admit that and it was this book spark that talked about exercise and the impact on the brain that really opened my eyes to it and the type of cardio you want to be doing is where your heart rate is 180 minus your age as sort of the maximum so if you're 40 years old 140 would be the maximum so the range would be like 120 to 140 you'll get the benefits from it and somewhere between 20 and 40 minutes for it right 30 minutes is probably where you should start aiming for and honestly this kind of exercise it can be boring I treat it like medicine for me I remember in Prague there was a while where I was doing cardio every day and I'll tell you right now my mind was on fire in the best of ways my energy levels my ability to focus my ability to just make good decisions and do what I wanted and the serious lack of brain fog the results from this time of my life it was incredible and don't worry it is something I'm getting back i'm not doing cardio every day right now but i do many days as well but i remember then because it was the winter in prague that i had to just go to this gym and i treated it like medicine i would bring my phone i'd watch youtube videos i might respond to emails or youtube comments but i just said i have to sit in this bike and do this for 25-30 minutes it's boring but it's my medicine just do it and now like i'm in spain so it's actually february as well but i'm in spain this time and so now i'm doing things like playing tennis going for runs on the beach occasionally going to the gym as well to mix it up to make it more fun but if you are somewhere where you can't do that right now if the weather is terrible or you don't have the time just do 20 minutes buy a skipping rope and do it do jumping jacks go get an exercise bike or something but just do the 20 to 30 minutes as a minimum and you will notice the first few days you might not notice a lot but it will really make a difference and very quickly i don't want to complicate this video too much but in addition to this kind of cardio exercise that requires a lot of coordination and learning so things like perhaps rock climbing to play basketball or tennis or hockey that's going to be even better than just boring stationary cardio and the six thing you can do that will have a tremendously positive impact on the negative symptoms of adult ADHD is some kind of mental focus this can be prayer this can be meditation this can be something like yoda yoda if you can talk to yoda honestly I think Yoda might be one of the best treatments you sit there he gives you motivational advice you have positive relationships he gives you missions to do which include exercise and goal-setting which is good as well so if you can do any kind of Yoda in your life I recommend it if Yoda is not available consider yoga as well as a plan-b throughout this video one of the things you might have noticed is I said treat the negative symptoms of adult ADHD and that is because there are so many positive traits we get from ADHD that give us what I would say our superpowers I'm going to make a video on the superpowers of ADHD and what makes us awesome the cool thing that I have found and I think this is what is Bow really across the board is when you treat these negative symptoms with things like exercising positive relationships better diet what ends up happening is you get all the good still but supercharged and not the bad and you can be an absolute friggin rockstar speaking of rockstars now it's your turn to be a rockstar let me know in the comments below which of these you have done in your own life and what the effects and benefits have been and if you're new to the channel we are a community of rockstars so hit that subscribe button

        "video_sub_title": "today we're gonna find out not only what my testosterone level is but also what other things we should be looking at when we want to better our health on a hormone level like our free testosterone we can use this information to accurately understand what is happening inside our bodies and if something isn't right at least we know where to start this is exactly what happened to me when I got my results back if I had just ordered the most basic test then I would have thought everything was fine I might even have been a little bit impressed but when I took a closer look I realized things weren't as good as it first seemed and I needed to take a serious look and make some improvements and these same improvements may be able to help you but I'm getting a bit ahead of myself let me start at the beginning what I did is I ordered a hormone test from let's get checked and full disclosure I was able to get them to sponsor this video the process is pretty simple once the test kit arrived I had to prick my finger with a Lancet and fill the collection tube with blood then I put it in the packaging they supplied and shipped it off to them you get your results online in two to five days so here are my results total testosterone is twenty nine point six and animals per liter now if you're in the US then you'd go buy nanograms per dekaliter and this converts into eight hundred and fifty three point seven nanograms per dekaliter which sounds pretty good the average T level for a man is about six hundred and seventy nine with a thousand being about the highest possible naturally but here's where this room for improvement when it comes to my sex hormone-binding globulin for it's the rest of the video I'll refer to it as SHBG I'm at the very upper end of normal and this is important as it binds to testosterone effectively making it unusable so you could feasibly have normal test levels but have symptoms of low testosterone simply because you have high sex hormone-binding globulin this becomes even more clear when you look at my free androgen index so you see here I'm at the very low end of normal this is basically the amount of usable or free testosterone that I have in my body after accounting for the testosterone that's bound up by the SHBG right after we look at the last two things that I had tested we're gonna come back and see what we can do to improve this number because no matter what our total testosterone is the higher our androgen index the more anabolic state will be n to build muscle and the more testosterone we'll have available for other body functions the next thing they tested for is prolactin and this came up average if prolactin is high it interferes with the testes and the production of testosterone the last test is for estradiol which is essentially estrogen and again you can see that I'm in the normal levels many of the symptoms of high estrogen are the same as low testosterone and usually if one is high estrogen they also have low testosterone so it's good to see where we're at now improving total free testosterone will benefit any man and the best way to do this is to lower our sex hormone-binding globulin level of course they say our levels increase as we age just like they say our testosterone levels decrease as we age now I've read enough studies to know and we can see here with my own test results the testosterone doesn't necessarily have to decrease which brings me to the question what do we need to do to lower our SHBG levels there are a couple of diseases like hyperthyroidism and liver disease as well as some medications that will elevate sex hormone-binding globulin as there's a lot of hormones in our body being at a good body fat percentage helps not only does it improve growth hormone and testosterone production but it also decreases SHBG what we eat is also important higher protein diets have been shown to lower sex hormone-binding globulin and to high fiber diets have been shown to increase it now I already have a high enough protein diet but because of my high vegetable intake I wondered if this might be something I could improve but after checking my average fiber consumption it turned out to be about 24 grams a day still under the recommendation of 30 grams per day for a man studies have shown that abstinence from alcohol even for a short period of time can reduce sex hormone-binding globulin levels don't want to take a lot of supplements but vitamin D is one that I'm seriously thinking about starting not only has it been shown to increase testosterone but also free testosterone and it does this no matter what level of body fat we might have the second one I'm thinking of is boron and while it's found in foods if I wanted to do an experiment with vitamin D and ball and to see if it increases my free testosterone a supplement might be the best way to ensure that I took a consistent trackable amount the results of boron are quite promising one study showed lower levels of SHBG in as little as six hours and by the end of the study there was a 28% increase in free testosterone so in order to see if these supplements can help me I would take them for one month then retest myself and see if there is any improvement in my free androgen index now if you'd like to find out what your testosterone a free androgen levels are

        "video_sub_title": "hi welcome to the Duke suture skills course my name is Michael Zen and on the director of the human tissue lab here at Duke this course will teach you the basics in suture technique we'll review simple suture mattress suture running suture and some of the variations and proper surgical technique it's our goal that by teaching you proper technique you'll be the best surgical resident or surgeon that you can be before we get started I'd like to thank G in the office at Duke for their generous grant that made this video possible before get started showing you different suture techniques I want to show you a basic instrument I this can be used with any of the suture techniques that you'll learn once the suture is placed you'll have a short end and then a longer loop end your needle driver should be placed directly between the two and then we will do a surgeon's knot you'll wrap there's a longer end twice around the needle driver grab the smaller end and pull it to the opposite side and what will happen when you pull it to the opposite side it will square the knot and you can see how square the knot sits down now because it's a surgeon's knot it'll sit unless you pull up on it so don't pull up on it place the needle driver between the two the short end and the loop end now you're going to loop it around only once grab the short end and then bring it to the opposite side again squaring the knot and don't pull up on the suture until you just get it down and then you can tighten it and now it's locked in place I recommend at least three throws instrument between bring the small to the other side and done some suture material you may need four throws something maybe like an absorbable suture but this is a very basic technique it allows you to suture in a small place so if multiple people are working and will do one more for you right here you can suture notice I like to keep this short and very short your instrument doesn't move around very much then keep the needle driver between the two grab the small end pull it to the opposite side square and you're not lock it down with that surgeon's knot don't pull up on it now until you now grab this and then pull it through for the second time and now it locks down needle driver between the two wrap once pull through the opposite side and keep that knot nice and square square nuts will not untie also will look cosmetically more appealing the first suture we're going to teach you is the simple interrupted suture this is the most common suture that you'll be using and wound closure just a quick tip on handling a needle you'll notice your needle has a flat portion in the middle this is where you grab the needle with your needle driver you don't want to grab it at the end where the suture comes in or the swedge because it's round and you'll be unstable never grab the needle at the tip because you'll dull it a simple bike will want to enter the skin at 90 degrees and we'll go back a few millimeters from the skin edge and take a nice bite perpendicular to the skin and then on the opposite side the same and exaggerate that 90 degrees if you take it at 90 degrees the skin edges will then Evert and come together nicely here we'll set up a instrument tie and you can see here again we do three throws for nylon and we'll go ahead and clip this this is approximation without tension you want to go back a couple millimeters for each bite if you go back too far it'll tend to invert the skin and we want to avoid that so here again exaggerate the 90 degrees on each side to make sure that we are back the same distance on each side an a instrument tie we do a surgeon's knot for the first we cross the suture over lay it down nice and flat don't pull up on it until we get the second suture down and tighten it and lock it in so this is the simple suture it's something that you'll need to practice a lot to master next is a simple buried suture this will be the main suture you'll use when putting some deeper sutures in before putting your skin suture in it's important to bury a suture that we start deep and go superficial and end up in the dermis without buttonholing the skin and then on the opposite side we're gonna do the opposite we're gonna go superficial and then deep and if you want your not to bury it's important that both ends are on the same side of the loop you see here's my loop and here's the suture coming out from the same side and as we tie this down we'll do an instrument tie but we'll pull it along the length of the wound and that'll help the skin adjust to come together and do a nice instrument tie and what this does is it takes the tension off the skin so that when you go to do your skin closure you really can work on approximation you can see here that helps hold that together let's go ahead and do one more you're gonna go from deep superficial without button hauling the skin and then go from superficial to deep make sure that you're coming out on the same side of the loop and we'll do our instrument tie and we'll pull it along the length of the wounds so it'll allow it to bury come back to the other side and back to the other side that is our simple interrupted buried suture next is the vertical mattress suture Furcal mattress suture is a very useful suture especially when wounds are hard to close if they're under a lot of tension or maybe there's a lot of swelling or you anticipate swelling it's especially valuable when skin is just want to keep rolling in and you want to even some we'll call this the far far near near stitch and this is the configuration of your suturing we're gonna enter far from the wound travel under the skin come out far and then come back and go near near essentially you're taking this part of the skin and closing it to this part of the skin and that's the power of the suture simple suture is really relying on that much smaller area so we'll start far and travel under the skin and the same thing on the other side and we'll turn our needle around and now we'll go near and near and what you'll see when we tie this down is that this approximates an averse to skin edges and we can make it just as tight as we want we have our granny knot that'll hold it and we'll square our knots so I'll show you that one more time it's a vertical mattress suture far far near there and as you tie it down decide how much tension you need do you hurt your skin edges and hold things together and that's your vertical mattress our next suture is the horizontal mattress suture it's configuration is horizontal as opposed to our vertical mattress you can think of this as two simple sutures so in some of that since it's a simple suture it just saves you some time it's important here that you stay close to the skin edge and you are the same distance on both sides you'll take your bite on one side and then the other side and then you'll turn it around and you'll go back so you'll end up on the same side and there you can see our mattress the advantage of this is speed compared to doing simple suture it doesn't you've ER it as effectively sometimes as a vertical mattress here you see the way I've placed it it's reverting nicely so that's one example of a horizontal technique a variant of this is the figure-of-eight suture the figure-of-eight suture is the same distribution you take your simple bite in your simple bite but rather than turning the needle around you move on and take your next simple bite and simple bite what that does when you tie this it'll make a small little eight and that's why it's called a figure of eight suture the advantage of this again is speed instead of doing two simple sutures and tying two simple sutures you'll see that sometimes in some deeper closures like fascial closures because again you're grabbing a bunch of tissue to a bunch of tissue and therefore it'll be more secure the final variant of the horizontal mattress is called a half-buried mattress and we use this a lot in plastic surgery if there's an area where you don't want suture holes you can actually start your horizontal mattress on one side on the opposite side stay within the dermis in a horizontal fashion in a sub-q ticular fashion and then come back on the other side again out like you wouldn't a normal horizontal mattress so effectively it's your horizontal mattress but half of it is buried tends to name the half bare horizontal mattress and when you tie this here it'll secure the skin and you only have suture marks on one side you'll see we'll do this at times when we have a hair bearing area and an on hand bearing area we want to hide the suture marks or if it's a very end or tip of a flap and we're afraid that putting sutures in the tip is gonna interrupt the blood supply so our three variants of a horizontal the straight horizontal mattress the figure of eight and the half-buried horizontal mattress our next stitch is a simple running suture this will be the most common suture you'll use to close incisions it's a simple suture so again 90 degrees and 90 degrees same bites on both sides and you'll start with an instrument tying and try to save length on your suture here you also want to measure the length of your wound and not make sure you're not working with such a long suture that it becomes unruly you'll take you'll advance on the wound in symmetric fashion again trying to take 90 degree bites each time try to move along at the same pace and same amount each time almost mimicking a sewing machine if you move along the same distance each time and take the same bites on each side have a beautiful cosmetic closure people will ask well how much do you move along my answer is as long as it's the same on both sides it'll end up looking very nice so be consistent in your bites notice I'm exaggerating my 90 degrees because I want this to e vert I if I go too far back on the skin or I take too shallow a bite I'll end up inverting the skin and it won't heal correctly notice also I'm just pulling up enough on the suture just so that the skin edges touch pulling up on the suture very hard it's just ischemic and can cause bad scarring I'll end it with a simple little bite at the end make sure we have enough tension along the incision and then do our instrument tie at the end and this is a simple running closure a variation of the simple suture is the simple running locking suture we start off the same with simple bites and a nice instrument tie and this is a very helpful suture when you're sewing under some tension especially when you don't have an assistant who can help hold the suture for you and follow you you'll take your simple bites again 90 degrees 90 degrees you've hurt the skin edges but before you pull up you'll make sure and actually lock the suture and take your simple bite and simple bite and again before pulling up the last little bit you'll lock your suture and you can go on from here and the beauty of this is that you see although it's loose here it is locking back here and so when you're under a lot of tension especially it'll hold for itself now sometimes I'll do a running stitch and I don't plan on doing a running locking but at some point in the middle of the suture it starts loosening on me and then you can just throw in one of these locking sutures I always keep it nice and tight so it's not a suture necessarily that you'll use primarily because I think for scoring purposes you prefer a regular suture and I will say also as you become more and more expert at suturing you'll be able to control your simple suits you're much better each time locking the suture and we're going to end this with a simple stitch and again when we tie this we want to main to make sure we have good tension on the rest of the suture and that is our running walking suture our next stitch is a running subcuticular sutures how do all those sutures were teaching you this is probably the hardest to master this is probably for the most cosmetic closure as they're running within the dermis deeply so there's no sutures on the outside at all so you won't see any of the railroad tracking that you would see from any other outside sutures this is a absorb assuit sure and we will start by burying the knot so I'll go deep in the corner away from the skin maybe just a very deepest part of the dermis and we'll do our instrument tie and this allows the knot to be buried so we can suture over it this is important because we don't want knots coming up to the skin they can stick out it's called spitting patients do not like it when the knots bit now with knot is deep so we're gonna go deep and we're gonna come superficial and that brings us right up to the corner and this is where we're gonna start our so particularly run when you start to get close to a corner definitely recommend smaller bites to start see I'm just within the dermis horizontal bites need to advance a little bit on the other side and take another small bite against a wall within the dermis now with this stitch Simoes asked us how much do you advance each time what I like to do is to see here with my suture where the next bite should be and that's where I'm going to put it so in some sense it depends on how much tension there is on this wound there's not a lot of tension now we're gonna start to take regular bites on each side I'm trying to take the same depth and the same amount of tissue each time as we begin to advance keep pulling everything up and keeping tension notice I'm not pulling up very tight either just getting the skin to approximate no buttonholing of the skin this is just pure horizontal dermis wants to come right there can get a good play the dermis wants to come right there and just like when we started as you begin to approach the corner you want to stop taking such big bites and start going to some smaller bites because you really want these skin edges to be well approximated at the corner and not create any dog ears we also want to bury our knot so if we're on a berry or not we have to start thinking about now about getting deep with both of the two ends that are gonna get tied so at this point here I'm superficial and I'm gonna go superficial on this side and then head deep that'll get me down just sort of where we started down deep and I'm going to take one more bite that's deep now I want to tie that and that'll help to bury the knot and now what I'm gonna do to help bury the knot as well is to cut the short end here right on the edge of the knot and now take the needle and very that not further so I'm gonna pick up here and see where that knots going I can come out through the skin nearby and just simply pull up on this I can just cut it flush with the skin that helps the duck are not from our suture that concludes this course we at Duke feel strongly that excellent surgeons begin with excellent basic technique and I hope you've learned some of that during this video come back often as you begin to perfect your own technique if you'd like to learn more about Duke Plastic Surgery or

        "video_title": "Physio Neck Exercises Stretch & Relieve Routine",
        "video_sub_title": "Hi I'm Michelle and welcome to pelvic exercises.\u00a0 Today I'm going to take you through some neck\u00a0\u00a0 exercises to help you take tension out of your\u00a0 neck muscles relax your neck and shoulders. So\u00a0\u00a0 these exercises should feel really comfortable\u00a0 they shouldn't cause you any discomfort at all\u00a0\u00a0 throughout the little series that we're about to\u00a0 start with. So first of all I'd like you to sit\u00a0\u00a0 nice and tall where you are. You can be sitting\u00a0 to do these exercises. Think tall, lift the crown\u00a0\u00a0 of your head towards the ceiling, shoulders are\u00a0 back and down and relaxed and let's start by just\u00a0\u00a0 taking a deep breath in rolling the shoulders\u00a0 forward up and back and around and breathe out\u00a0\u00a0 and down take the tension out of your shoulders.\u00a0 Let's go again breathe it in rolling forward and\u00a0\u00a0 relax down just moving your shoulder girdle. And\u00a0 one more time breathing in and breathing out and\u00a0\u00a0 take it down and relax. Alright let's just slowly\u00a0 take the chin down towards the chest just within\u00a0\u00a0 the range of comfort. You should feel a little\u00a0 gentle stretch through the back of your neck and\u00a0\u00a0 lift back up. And once more take the chin down\u00a0 towards your chest just gently and lift back\u00a0\u00a0 up you can provide a little bit of overpressure\u00a0 just very gently by taking your elbows wide and\u00a0\u00a0 taking your chin down. Remember to stay sitting\u00a0 tall that will just increase the stretch very\u00a0\u00a0 gently and lifting back up and lowering the arms\u00a0 down Let's now start to stretch into the sides\u00a0\u00a0 of our neck. So I want you to sit nice and tall\u00a0 relax your shoulders down and just take one ear\u00a0\u00a0 across to the shoulder so opposite shoulder.\u00a0 You're not rotating forward you're just taking\u00a0\u00a0 the ear directly down keeping the other shoulder\u00a0 down if you're sitting in a chair you can hold on\u00a0\u00a0 to underneath the base of the chair to stabilize\u00a0 that shoulder. And slowly back up and the other\u00a0\u00a0 side just very gently taking the ear across the\u00a0 shoulder feeling the stretch down through the side\u00a0\u00a0 of your neck staying nice and relaxed keep hold\u00a0 of underneath the chair on that side and lift up\u00a0\u00a0 and you can repeat these again if you choose to.\u00a0 I'm just going to move through them fairly quickly\u00a0\u00a0 we're going to rotate now and nose around towards\u00a0 our opposite armpit again I'm holding underneath\u00a0\u00a0 the chair nose around and down I can lift my hand\u00a0 up and just gently guide my nose down towards my\u00a0\u00a0 armpit. The stretch is down through that side of\u00a0 your neck so I've got my left hand underneath the\u00a0\u00a0 chair nose right now nose going down to my right\u00a0 armpit. And lifting up slowly taking the right\u00a0\u00a0 hand underneath the chair left hand on top of the\u00a0 head just guiding my nose down gently towards my\u00a0\u00a0 armpit and lifting up and taking it down. Now\u00a0 we're going to get a little bit fancy here,\u00a0\u00a0 we're going to stretch the muscles down through\u00a0 the back into the shoulder below to the back of\u00a0\u00a0 the neck down to the shoulder blade this is a\u00a0 really nice little stretch if you tend to shrug\u00a0\u00a0 high it stretches out those muscles that lift the\u00a0 scapula or the shoulder blades. So again taking\u00a0\u00a0 the arms back this time back behind the chair\u00a0 a little bit bring your right hand up just take\u00a0\u00a0 your fingertips over the top of the head and\u00a0 guide your nose down towards your right knee\u00a0\u00a0 in that direction. Your left hand is behind\u00a0 your body holding on behind the chair and you\u00a0\u00a0 should feel that stretch right down into your\u00a0 left shoulder blade should feel really quite\u00a0\u00a0 comfortable and release. And you could repeat that\u00a0 again on that side if you choose to I'm going to\u00a0\u00a0 move to the other side so right hand down behind\u00a0 my back holding on underneath the base of the\u00a0\u00a0 chair left hand over the top guiding the nose down\u00a0 towards the knee so my left knee I'm feeling the\u00a0\u00a0 stretch in the right side right shoulder blade\u00a0 and lifting back up slowly. And link all your\u00a0\u00a0 fingers together push your shoulders forward reach\u00a0 your hands forward right in front take your chin\u00a0\u00a0 down towards your chest. And if you can reach out\u00a0 behind reverse big stretch up behind and bring the\u00a0\u00a0 arms down and if the head back up. Breathe it in,\u00a0 lift the shoulders breathe out and let go of any\u00a0\u00a0 tension. And again once breathe in and breathe out\u00a0 and let go of any tension. And to finish nice tall\u00a0\u00a0 posture lifting up through the crown of your head\u00a0 shoulders are relaxed back and down. And I hope\u00a0\u00a0 you enjoyed that little neck routine look forward\u00a0 to exercising with you again soon, bye for now.",

This will not only guarantee that we enjoy healthy teeth for many years, but it is also an essential requirement to be able to maintain the dental treatments that we receive.  have made the prognosis of these treatments and their duration over the years is closely linked to correct oral hygiene to simplify the brushing sequence we will divide the mouth into four quadrants in this way it will be easier for us and we will avoid forgetting any area we will place  a small amount of toothpaste on the brush if we exceed the amount of toothpaste , a lot of foam will be generated during brushing, which is uncomfortable and can cause nausea, we will start at the top in quadrant 1 first brush the external faces  of the teeth for it I will place  We will hold the brush perpendicular to the tooth, slightly inclined towards the gum, we will bring the brush closer and we will carry out a descending movement, gently turning the brush until we reach the end of the tooth, we will then separate the brush and return to the initial position, repeating the same movement several times brushing must always be from the gum to the tooth and never the other way around once the brushing of the external faces is finished we will brush the internal faces using the same technique finally we will catch the grinding faces for this we will make horizontal movements forwards and backwards finished brushing  from quadrant 1 we will go to quadrant 2 brushing it in the same way for the lower part we will start with quadrant 3 as in the upper one we will start with the external faces of the teeth we will place the brush perpendicular to the tooth slightly inclined towards the gum we will approach the cep  illo and we will make ascending movements gently turning the brush and always from the gum towards the tooth after the external faces we will go to the internal faces finally we will catch the crushing faces with horizontal movements once the brushing of quadrant 3 is finished we will go to quadrant 4 brushing  In the same way, once we have finished brushing all the quadrants, we will go on to brush the tongue. For this, we will take out the tongue and place the brush perpendicularly on the back, then we will sweep towards the front of the tongue, always from back to front to maintain  good hygiene is essential to keep the brush in good condition and free of dirt, so we must change it regularly every two or three months",

        "video_title": "My Mold Illness Story + How To Deal With Mold Illness // Laura's Natural Life",
        "video_sub_title": "hey friends today I am going to be sharing about chronic inflammatory response syndrome something that is very near and dear to me because it is something that I suffer from and also one in four of you out there so across the whole population have the genes and you're predisposed to getting this condition so I also teamed up with my friend Aviva who is a veteran with this disease too and she has some totally different tips than I do so she's also sharing her story and her tips so I will link her video down below she is such a doll such a sweetheart she's one of my real-life friends too so we met on YouTube so chronic inflammatory response syndrome is the full technical name for what I and a lot of other sufferers referred to as mold illness now before you check out cuz you don't really care about mold I want you to know about one in four people in the entire population carries the gene for this disease so that is why I wanted to make this video to spread awareness about it and because if you suffer from like a weird health condition and you have had like a billion diagnoses or no one can diagnose you you might want to listen up because it could be some things that you want to consider having checked out I want to share with you the common symptoms of biotoxin illness so what I mean when I say that one in four people have the genetic traits that predispose them to this condition it is I mean that one in four people may have this condition or it may never be triggered there has to be two things other than the genetic component to trigger chronic inflammatory response syndrome and that is one sufficient exposure to biotoxins and to a triggering event so that could be a big illness something like Lyme disease it could be just a really horrible time in your life that was really stressful it could be an exposure to like some terrible chemicals for instance it could be a number of things but you have to have had exposure and you have to have had a trigger I had a lot of exposure growing up I had lived in water damaged buildings I lived in the south for a little bit in my brand-new school I know how to had a mold problem we also had found mold in our windows and we're getting that taken care of and and during that time we also had our carpets cleaned and they majorly messed up and released some sort of chemical bomb that marinated with mold in our windows and we had to get rid of all of our stuff and we had to move isn't the only culprit so mold illness is caused by exposure to biotoxins by the toxins are toxins created by living things so that could be a bacteria it could be toxins created from yourself those are called endotoxins by metabolism we create waste etc could be mold mold is the biggest culprit mold in mycotoxins mycotoxins are the toxins that mold produces and even dead mold can continue to produce those toxins there's also fungal toxins there's microbial VOCs but most commonly we're going to be talking about mycotoxins and those are in water damaged buildings it's been estimated that 85% of buildings have had water damage and 50% maybe currently water damage and after water damage it only takes mold 24 hours to grow so if you have a leak in your home or your workplace really be vigilant about getting it cleaned up and dried immediately that might mean you cut off the drywall it might mean that you put a fan up whatever it is you have to stop the leak you have to get that water damaged part out of the building usually if a person without this gene a regular normal person is exposed to large numbers of biotoxins they're still probably going to get sick it's maybe not but most likely and then their body's recognized biotoxins as toxins and their bodies get rid of them usually all on their own people who have a chronic inflammatory response syndrome don't do that their bodies don't recognize those as toxins and so those toxins stay in their bodies so usually our bodies to store toxins in our fat cells and that is why we really need to work to detoxify if we are one of these people so as you guys know I have a chronically flatterers son syndrome I'm just gonna call them old illness from here on out because it's very very long so I have mold illness you guys know that I have Lyme disease and from those two things I have a number of conditions that are sort of secondary like chronic migraine I have adrenal fatigue I have hypothyroid and on occasion I do have pops so looking back it was kind of obvious that I had a problem with mold for instance when I would go in old buildings that my mom would drive me to a crap show for I would feel really like just weird like dizzy or just I just felt weird in there and then in college I tried to live in an old building and there was visible like mold bubbling out under the paint and I got after just a few nights in there I got sores in my mouth and like down my throat from living there so I always knew that I should stay away from moldy places like places that were obviously moldy I didn't know I had anything to do with genetics or a particular disease I just thought I was like allergic to molars I've already talked about my first big triggering event I then after that event I still was pretty normal I still felt normal all the time I had I've had migraines since I was 15 so I still had migraines I did notice my mom was always very sensitive to sense so we were a very low sentient household if we wanted to wear perfume we had to put it on outside and couldn't come back in the house of it but we couldn't use nail polish in the house except Russ what I did notice is that I developed environmental allergies seasonal allergies I've never been allergic to nature and day in my life and after that first trigger I was allergic to trees I was allergic to grass shortly thereafter I got married and moved into a home that my husband hadn't purchased before I came into his life it was brand-new when he bought it so it was about a year old when I moved in and it was new construction cheap new construction and if you guys don't know about construction and how toxic it is new construction releases VOCs and other harmful chemicals in the air constantly from the carpet to the sealant to the paint to the drywall to the varnishes to the cabinets to every single thing in there releases chemicals so that was my second trigger hooked out my health for real you guys want to hear more about that experience and more about my health story in general I will link a video that I did on that down below but I really wanted to make this my target on the mold illness how you have it what you can do about it so now living in a safe home is the best thing for me my body has really been enjoying that though other ways that mold affects me in my day-to-day life I can smell it on somebody's clothing even if I can't smell it I can tell if they live in a moldy house because I'll start reacting to their clothing and I can do this from feet away it doesn't have to be real close to me if I go in a store that has mold in it and I can tell I have leave immediately don't even chance it but the biggest problems for me are finding a safe place to work because so so many buildings are water damaged 85% and the other thing that's very hard for me is we really enjoy traveling and finding a safe place to stay is really difficult especially not being able to go there beforehand and check it out so there is a series of protocols that I do to find a safe hotel or Airbnb you guys are interested in that maybe I can do a blog post about it I think I actually have it typed up from an old old blog that I had before that I never told anybody about so if you're interested in that please let me know and basically if I encounter any mold during the day I when I'm able to come back home I wash my clothes immediately and thieves I put a couple of drops of thieves in my laundry and I shower immediately if for some reason would get in my car somebody visited my home something like that I do also defuse these in the air so in order to recover from mold illness there are two big things that you have to have to do one you have to live in a place without bolts you need to get out of that situation same thing with work if you work in a mold a building if you're just continuing to expose yourself you will never get better bottom line you'll never get better you have to get out remediation it may not be enough there are so many bad places that will remediate your home of mold you can't just dump bleach on it you cannot you cannot just kill mold because dead mold will still release spores and even if you remediated incorrect and you don't seal off that area you can still release spores into the rest of your home or the rest of your building so if you're going to remediate you have to find a reputable place that really really knows what they're doing so until you can get out and once you have gotten out you are going to have to go through the process of taking toxin binders that bind to those bio toxins and help escort them out of your body since your body doesn't do it on its own so how I treat myself now with with my own self and my doctor's knowledge I live in a safe place I work in a safe place I take very frequent far infrared saunas and I use toxin binders on a daily basis if I have a very bad exposure I take cholesterin drug and it is not without side effects so I do not use that one on a daily basis but I choose healthy safe natural toxin miners like bentonite clay I take it someone that called vine which is a bunch of minders put together but activated charcoal is probably the best known binder if you are concerned that you might have a mold illness or know somebody who does I will list some resources down below like dr. Richie shoemaker who is the one who sort of pioneered this effort his website is called surviving Volcom the book you need to read is called mold warriors it gives you all of the testing information of how to get tested to see if you have this gene to see if it's affecting you and also a list of doctors who are able to treat this because the average Western medical doctor doesn't know about mold illness the average naturopath doesn't even know about mold illness or how to treat it correctly you really need to find a doctor who understands it and knows how to help you so to recap if you're worried even if you're not worried one of old avoid mold like the plague an air filter enough is not enough to help you if you live in a moldy in my ready it's not an air filter can't do anything amazing formal number two toxin binders number three protect your environment and to prevent mold the best way to do that is of course there's any leaks clean it up immediately don't let it stay wet dry it off immediately cut out the drywall if you have to and also use a dehumidifier so diffuse thieves in your home make sure to clean out spaces that may be prone to growing they'll do or muster mold because mold my friends is no joke I still have some symptoms I am still extremely sensitive if there's something with mold around me I will react immediately however I don't have the horrible symptoms that I was having day in and day out even though I lived in a mold free environment I wasn't able to get those toxins out of my body and so I was still having the problem so just removing yourself in this situation is extremely crucial to getting better but it's not enough so I would highly encourage you guys to check it out check out the surviving mold website just if you think that this could be a problem for you follow through with it because it is a huge deal and you'll feel so much better if you are able to get the mold out of your life also make sure that you check out my friend Aviva's video she's gonna be sharing her story with mold she's at a very different place in hers on I am with mine and she has some different tips that I didn't even know about so I will link that down below - thank you guys so much for watching I will see you guys in the next video",

        "video_sub_title": "what do you want to know about him why I have to okay so much okay do you want to know anything else about them where they come from where they stem from okay so we're gonna make them stop okay would be good yeah and then what else how to get this welcome this is dr. Boren Cal Stein here in Baltimore Maryland I'm with Tegan Tegan is a chiropractic assistant here and she's training for her physical therapy assistant certification as well and we're going to talk about cervical genic headaches if you just caught our conversation in the beginning she was bringing up a couple things when I said we're gonna talk about cervical genic headache she's like yeah yeah I want to know what those are I don't know why I have him mm-hmm I want to know what to do about him and if she didn't work here and get free service in the back of her head she'd be like I wanna know how much it costs to take care of it - yeah so if your if your student those are the things that people come in they want to know what's going on how does it get better how can I get it better on my own and how are you gonna help me get it better and what's what's the cost for that for me as a person or as an individual what's that going to look like so I can care ass my mind about expectations of care so that's just little side of it but well today we're going to be doing a clinical series this is episode 1 of that clinical series and I don't know cervical genic headaches and there are three types of categories of pain compass stemming from from a headache or danity migraines you get cervical genic headaches and you get what's called cluster headaches each of those have different timings and different areas where people experience pain we're going to talk about cervical jetting headaches first now the name gives away some of the answers to where they come from so servic cervical spine and origin is where these headaches stem from and and usually they're from the first three vertebra in the spine so c1 c2 and c3 and those structures that are associated with the spine as well as the ligaments and the muscles surrounding those muscles where are what can cause the refer pain to refer up into the head right and that's because of some of the accessory nerves that exit at the base of the skull and how pain can refer into different areas so when someone comes in and says I have a headache and I'm thinking in the back of my mind potentially going to be cervical genic what does that mean right cervical spine pain can refer into the base of it here it can refer out to the side it can refer to the ear and it can refer over into the eye or over into the forehead so if the durricks they're describing some of those pain patterns right and then their history is also really important when it comes to where is this pain coming from where is this headache coming from so repetitive stress is one thing that can cause a cervical genic heading so students are sitting like this all day long they notice towards the end of their study habits that get a headache coming on they're staring at the computer screen they're straining their neck in that position that can be a source of cervical genic headaches so chronic stress or poor posture and coupled with that chronic stress so that's one thing minor traumas whiplashes or playing a sport or activity where the neck is being used excessively like football or cross if someone comes in they're a heavy hitter and they're talking about getting headaches I want to look at the suboccipital in the neck to see if that somewhere that can be causing that referred pain right those are the two primary causes of cervical anything so we're looking at chronic stressors like postural stressors and then we're looking at micro traumas where people are getting into a little bit more physical positions now that would be the two primary sources of cervical genic headaches and stress and daily habits can also lead to these things and and exacerbate them a little bit more but primarily when we would talk about pain referring for an area it's from the cervical spine c1 c2 and c3 so what can you do about it there are stretches that you can do for the neck let's show them forward stretch so if you bring your chin down to your chest your elbows come together and you roll your head forward you'll feel pull in the back of your neck you take a deep breath in you exhale let your head fall you'll feel that stretch increase to do that again breathe in and then you exhale you bring your elbows together you fill a pool right down the middle good and then take another breath in for me and then last exhale let it really fall good jobs all right now sit up nice and tall that's an easy forward neck stretch for the muscles right another stretch that I'll show you is just a little bit different you're going to take one hand behind your back and the other hand is going to come in in the front and you're gonna aim your chin to your opposite hip so I'm even my chin to my right hip I'm pulling down I'm letting my elbow gradually pull my neck down with my left arm tucking behind what that does is it pulls the shoulder blade out of the way and it elongates that stretch on that muscle that connects your shoulder blade to your neck so that's another stretch three easy breaths and you can do both sides with that okay and finally the active motion is really important for those muscles but you know those joints that we were talking about so chin translations is another one so can you show ya Liam chin translations or I'll show off with these and you can kind of coach me through them so I'm gonna bring my chin back on a railroad track I'm not gonna tilt my head out straight back straight back straight back on that train you don't want it to extend up too much not lift lifting is not good if you don't think you look pretty doing then we're doing wrong that's the biggest thing so aim for that double chin triple so you'll feel that pressure build up right below the base of your skull when you do this correctly you'll feel the stretch occur at the joint this is very effective when done correctly and done slowly for relieving some of that tension at the base of the neck okay and let me show you how I was a chiropractor I'll assess and and look at for cervical genic headaches first of all look at range of motion in the neck I'm gonna take a look at passive range of motion in the neck which means where she's not doing anything but I'm taking her neck through that range of motion and then I'll palpate the joints so go ahead and face me arms down by your side turn your head to your right for me as far as you can go good and to your left good and face me head straight back good and chin down to your chest good back up go straight back again for me turn your head to your right I'm gonna put some pressure is that uncomfortable I'll bet okay I'm leaving you here gonna push back is that uncomfortable yeah and where are they look at that whatever hinge like great they're right in there yeah I'm gonna bring the table up we've a treatment Eagan at the office [Music] from time to time she's she's had a history of some headaches and recently and said a little bit of a spike thing so let me show you how I would adjust then that come up on your back for me where's your ear pressure teeth it's like in my ear like inside of it depending on what position I'm in it kind of triggers it it's weird I noticed it last night when I was sleeping so muscles that are associated with those three vertebra that I was talking about when they become hypertonic they're constricted doing some soft tissue work over that area can help relieve some of the tension that can cause cervical genic headaches and she has a group of muscles here that are quite restrictive on the right side I'm gonna have you turn at your left all the way so I use a form of pin and stretch to help alleviate some of those symptoms you like to feel that in my ear when you press there so when it comes to finding the origin if I can get a change in the symptoms of the Wow while on the table that I know I'm in the right area I know I'm treating the right some systems that's really important so what I when I put pressure over these muscles there's a group of nerves that exit of the over that area so lesser occipital and greater occipital nerves an ocular nerve are gonna be associated with that higher cervical spine so if I can palpate slowly over the base of the skull and and when I get to an area that's restricted and tight like this and she has an increase or she feels the symptoms I know I need to work that tissue to relieve the tension over that area now in terms of what you can do you can ice this area home you can strap do the stretches that we talked about you can make sure that when you're when you're doing your homework or you're going through your your daily routine your posture is good that's really important you can make a difference just by being aware all right that's important a lot of times that if you go into a situation where this is severe and you go and you have imaging down then it's negative right most of the times imaging is not warranted in this case without conservative care first what is the treatment from the other side of the field right here from the side of the field that's a little bit more allopathic and that would be muscle relaxers and the anti inflammatories education there's not going to be a lot of manual work done if you were to say go to an urgent care but this really makes a huge difference with our patients when we treat the source of the problem so soft tissue work over the base of the skull gets that area to loosen up for me now I go a little bit deeper and I check palpation for the cervical spine joints I want to see an extension how she moves lateral flexion how she moves at those levels and I travel my fingers down that's C 0 C 1 C 2 C 3 C 0 joint that is so when I palpate into C 0 C 1 C 2 when I go to see - she's restricted at that level in lateral flexion with rotation so let me show you how I adjust that here please relax your shoulders okay you'll have a step over there loosen your shoulder good now turn your head all the way over to the left good yep so she's got a ton of earrings and stuff here makes a little bit more difficult for this adjustment but just try to relax good good oh that's interesting a little deep pop yeah turn it up to your lady for me get hold here reach across : laughs that shoulder I'm checking her upper thoracic spine good take a breath in easy exhale just easy compression over that area good gentle first rib adjustment take it honey feel good good so again we talked about where headaches can stem from and there's three categories migraines cluster headaches and cervical genic right when it's cervical genic it's usually coming from the first three structures in the cervical spine the first second and third vertebra the ligaments and the muscles associated with them you watched how we did some soft tissue work on those muscles we talked about different things that you can do at home like the stretches the icing at home 10 minutes of ice on your neck and then the type of other care that you can get if you go say to an allopathic or an urgent care what's going to happen if you do that right usually imaging is not needed in this type of situation and usually all you need is some manual therapy over the base or the muscles in the neck as well as adjustments to those areas that really clears these things up really well and now you get to go back to work and and have some fun your hair looks amazing so you're welcome Thanks so if you have any questions about cervical genic headaches or if you have friends that are experiencing those tagged them below I let them know that this is some there's some ways that you can deal with it on your own being aware of your posture is really important too and then if you're if you need a chiropractor reach out into your area look on Google reviews find a good chiropractor near you to get treatment for this type of thing it's really it's yeah we got to get going back to work it's something that you can handle and take care of in an active way and not just take medication for so if you have any questions post below thanks for watching our first episode thanks for watching [Music]",

        "video_sub_title": "hi everyone I hope you're doing well today today I actually wanted to do another entry in my back to the basics series and today's topic I'm going to be talking about is soft contact lenses I actually had to get glasses at us at a very young age I was probably about 9 when I first started wearing glasses and I didn't quite low wearing glasses but I mean to this day it doesn't bother me anymore but I was very self-conscious about it when I was much younger and I think it was probably around the age 13 that I spoke with my optometrist and we arranged for me to begin contact lens use and the contact lenses that we selected were soft contact lenses young or old even--we contact lenses are something that are an option or an alternative to glasses and like I said today I just want to share a couple of things about soft contact lens care and use and give you some pointers and tips about how to have the best experience possible if you have been given a prescription for soft contact lenses now for this purpose I'll just kind of gathered a little basket of things together that I feel like will kind of give you an overall view about what's going on when you do get contact lenses for example you'll want to have a good mirror or something that you feel like you can hold and look up close when you're putting your contact lenses in now as you do this more and more you'll notice it'll get so much easier so you won't really be Tauri by handheld mirrors and sometimes you won't even need a mirror at all and you'll just be able to do it and not worry about it another thing that you'll also make sure that you have our little contact lens cases and like I said I grabbed some generally the cases come in all different shapes and sizes there's two cases it has a left and a right I don't it's that girl on the top usually there'll be different colors they'll be different shapes one will be marked with like a symbol for example this one has a little eye right here you can see it these are clearly marked with a kind of an R for right and then the left one is just plain I mean either way they'll clearly distinguish which one's the right side and which one's the left side on your lenses that way when you go to take them out or to apply them you'll know which one is for the same eye a lot of times people have different prescriptions in different eyes now for example in one eye I think my prescription is like one point higher so it needs to be stronger in my right eye than it is in my left so that's why it's important to make sure that you keep them separate now for the purpose of this I'm actually going to use one of my older contact lenses and that was in Acuvue once this was the old friend that I used to use I got to the point where I talked with my doctor and I wanted to have a little more oxygen flow back and forth to my eye so we switched to these other ones but I am happy to have this one because I can actually show you the way the contact lens looks and the proper application so generally when you first get your contact lens you'll get a little pouch that looks like this they snap apart they're usually stuck together in a row what you'll do is you will just take and teraphim the pouch is just what I'm going to do now and inside of the pouch there's liquid and that is the liquid suspension that just holds the contact lens and keeps it moist and keeps it from drying out now what I recommend doing is when you first take it out you don't want to especially if you have fingernails kind of like longer fingernails like I do just gently use the tip of your ring finger and dab it into it and you'll notice your contact lens will come off on your fingertip and that just kind of helps eliminate just gouging it basically with your fingernails or you know you just don't want to damage it the first time you go to wear it now a contact lens is very thin and very flexible and I can show you with this one it's very clear you can see that it's so soft like this and they're easy to use and they're also easy to lose so I do recommend trying to keep a good hold of your contact lens or perhaps install your contact lenses over a hard surface or something that maybe if it were to drop you would be able to see it easily some contact lenses come with a slightly blue tinge and I think against the white you may be able to see these lenses are tinted with a very slight blue tinge to them while my other ones are actually completely clear so if I've dropped them in the past it does take a little bit of an eye to look for them but they're very soft and pliable now the way to tell which way to actually put your contact lens in and I'll show you I give you actually comes with a small a and v logo and if you look at the outside of the lens you should be able to read clearly a and fie the letter A and V now that is a very nice feature that I do miss about the occupy lenses that I don't experience with the ones that I use now but there's also another way to tell primarily it's going to be the shape of the lens when you have it on your finger and you look at it and I will show you this is the proper way to have a lens I hope that you can see that but the shape is going to be like a perfect bolt you're going to want your contact lens to look like a perfect cup or a perfect bowl when you go to actually stick it on your eye now if you have your lens turn the wrong way which is what I'm going to demonstrate now it's still going to be kind of similar in shape but you'll notice that maybe the lens doesn't sit properly on your hand and the edges of the lens will roll outward and I think you can see it it's kind of hard to tell but it's not quite as bowl shaped you can see and do you see how that corner on this backside rolls outward that is actually concave so instead of being a cup or a bowl it still maintains a cup or a bowl shape but the outside edges just flare up and out and that's what you don't want because that won't sit snugly onto your eye when you go to put your contact lenses on so I'm done with this one and I'm actually going to use my real contact lenses and I'm going to show you how I actually apply my lenses but you'll always want to make sure that whatever lens solution you're select is compatible with the type of material your contact lens is made out of now I'm going to take out a lens that I've had stored overnight and I'm going to show you how I actually put them in I remove it with that same gentle touch that I used to remove it from the other pack again I have my lens on my finger all right in the palm of my hand I'm going to take and place a few drops so basically I got a little puddle of contact lens solution in my hand and I'm gonna take my ring finger like this and I'm just gonna take and I'm gonna rub my ring finger around in this thing and I hope you can see this well but I'm gonna make sure to rub it around really good you can use whatever fingers easier but you just take your finger and just rub it around really good in the palm of your hand gently and then you're gonna want to take the lens and you're gonna want to flip it over to the other side and do the same thing you're gonna want to do this for a few seconds on both sides so you've got it really nice and clean and it is worth mentioning that your hands should be clean when you start this because you don't want to get any type of little sand bits or dust or anything like that so just be careful that your fingers are clean and you don't have any debris now once I made sure it's nice and rub down on both sides then what I like to do is of course make sure that I have the facing the right direction and there we go now I've got it in the proper direction so it's easy to tell they you'll have a cup shape then what I like to do is just look at the ones and make sure I don't see any dust or debris on that lens place a few drops of this solution into the lens I feel like for me with a little bit of solution in the lens I kind of have dry eyes so I feel like adding a little touch of solution and there really helps to get the lens on good and it feels like it's a nice moisture barrier between that and my eye what I like to do is take my pinky finger on the opposite hand and I'm just gonna raise my eyelid up so it exposes the surface of my eye and then I'm gonna take my lens use the ring finger of the hand that I'm applying with to pull the bottom of my eye down sorry I mean this is kind of gross but pull that down and you're gonna want to just lightly place the contact lens on your eye look down and around and the extra solution will run out but that's no big deal because you're gonna have like a towel or something to Pat it dry and then you're just gonna blink a few times and voila your contact lenses are in your eyes now if you notice you might have like a stinging or burning sensation you may have gotten a small piece of dust in your eye so you would just go to remove it and you would clean it out again put a little more solution in and then put it back in your eye now putting the solution on before you put it on is optional but like I said I personally prefer to take the solution put it in there if you have especially dry eyes you can forgo this step of using the actual solution inside everyone's and actually make sure same thing with this you used a rewedding drop or contact lens rewetting drops that are formulated for the materials that your lenses are made of and these are safe for silicone soft lenses and hydrogel lenses which is what mine are made of and you can use these at any time during the day if you feel like your eyes are dry or red or irritated this will remove dries your lens and just bring a lot more moisture to the area and again you can use this a few drops of this in lenz before you put it in your eye as well and that would just give it a little bit of a cooling sensation and you know just feel better when you put it on your eyes so you can use that or that the part in the evening you'll always want to make sure that you've changed out your contact lens solution that was used the night before or the day before depending on when you're putting these in you're gonna wanna put fresh contact lens solution in both wells of these make sure you have your lips handy so you can seal them up tightly you don't want to not seal them properly because they will dry out contact lenses can dry out overnight if they're not kept moist enough and once they dry out there's no reviving them they are done for they get very brittle they can crack like glass wood it's pretty interesting to see but um anyhow you're gonna do the reverse process and of course you know I'm gonna get up there and I'm gonna show you how I take them out because that's one thing that always scares people it's not so bad to put them in but taking them out can be a little bit scary so I'm gonna get back up here again and I'm gonna use the same eye and I'm gonna show you what I'll do is they'll get in front of a mirror again I'll use the ring finger and I like the ring finger because I get good control and a half freedom to use my first two fingers to actually do this process now I'm gonna look up and I'm gonna slide gently slide the contact lens down my eye like this and then I'm gonna take my two fingers and I'm gonna pinch and of course the contact lens comes right out and then I'll just pop it into the case make sure it's covered with the solution put film in on it and I'm done I let them sit overnight and soaked and then the following day I'll clean them off and I'll start the process all over again now again contact lenses you can have different recommended lengths of wear make sure that you have lenses that are going to meet your needs as far as length of wear make sure that if you're going to need to wear them for long periods of time that your doctor works with you to find something that is safe for for example eight hours of wear ten hours of wear 24 hours of wear so you'll find something that meets your needs all right guys I know a little bit of an unusual type of video but I thought it was something I really wanted to address because like I said some of you may have just been given a prescription for contact lenses and you're like oh my gosh what do I do how do I use them what do I do so hopefully this video has helped you in some way and here's to see you more clearly and bright sparkly eyes so I hope you guys have a fantastic day or night when you're watching this and I'll see you in my next video bye bye",

        "video_sub_title": "use light pressure to insert the brush straight 90 degrees in between teeth with a gentle wriggling action sometimes a slight bending or curving of the wire will allow for the proper angle especially on back teeth ease the brush in the brush is pushed too hard or the wrong size is used and the wire buckles discard the brush be careful not to overly stress the wire to avoid breakage choose the largest size that inserts without force the correct size should fit snugly but easily move the brush back and forth between your teeth implants and under crowns and bridges orthodontic patients can also use interdental brushes as they slide between the arch wire and the tooth and remove plaque from around the brackets it's a simple skill to learn stay with it for a few days and you'll become more aware of how to angle the wire and shimmy them between your teeth if the wire gets wedged between the teeth gently find the wire with your finger tip on the tongue side and push it toward the gum line and withdraw it by pulling it straight out sometimes floss can dislodge it as well if an interdental brush is carefully taken care of it may last for a few days like toothbrushes you can wash them out and reuse them until the bristles deteriorate or the bass wire has been bent too many times if you prefer you can dispose of them after a single use although this may cost more than less effective oral hygiene aids it is far far less than the costs associated with dental treatment unlike a toothbrush you can keep an interdental brush in your pocket and use it in many situations where it would not be suitable to brush you should always have one Within Reach",

Travis Owens with the r\u00f6sti thank you so much for joining me today in this video we're going to be addressing ways to eliminate or prevent pain on the inside of your thigh known as your adductors or your groin if you're experiencing pain here this video is for you so the first exercise that we're going to use to address pain in the groin or adductor is using our foam roller what we'll do is we'll put the foam roller directly in front of us on the floor and kneel down to where we're laying with our thighs on the foam roller simply turning the toes out will give us more of an adductor focus while we roll from here roll from just above the knee up towards the upper portion of the thigh making sure to stop at areas that feel tight or uncomfortable if you feel any burning or tingling make sure to get off of those areas we don't want to roll our nerves and for these areas we'll typically spend anywhere from one to three minutes total for our second exercise we're going to use a common rehab activity but we're gonna put a small twist on it well have you lay down on your back with your feet brought close to your glutes in between your knees we'll place a ball or if you're at home a pillow or beach towel squeeze your legs together on the object between your knees and elevate your hips off the floor using your glutes by tying together our posterior chain and our adductors we're going to be able to bring them together and help them function as a unit hold this position for 30 to 60 seconds depending on your current level of conditioning and repeat three to five times so our last exercise is going to be using a cool trick in the body where we can turn off a type muscle by activating its counterpart what we'll have you do is stand close to the wall with your affected side away from the wall from here lift the side closest to the wall to where your knee is at about a 30-degree angle to your hip from here press that knee into the wall which then activates the glute on the opposite side by turning this muscle on we're deactivating the muscle that we've had our injury in which is our adductor or growing for this exercise we're looking for duration here so hold anywhere from 30 to 60 seconds and repeat three to five times thank you so much for joining us for this video we hope that the exercises that we showed are beneficial for you in alleviating pain if you still experience pain on the inner part of your thigh or groin make sure to reach out to your local or asti provider so that we can help you to eliminate that pain to learn more about this condition click on the video here and as always subscribe to our channel to stay up to date with our latest videos we'll see you soon",

        "video_sub_title": "how's go guys and welcome to part two of the mesh bill in this part you'll see me make your head of the mace and handle part I hope you'll enjoy this video and I'll see you in the end let's not waste any more time and let's get to building all right I only noticed while editing it but if you look very very closely like look very true that right there fair share is doctor you can see I accidentally made three of the same shapes and one is the odd one out so because I care about people with OCD I'm gonna cut out this one another time not use this one so I two-bit are like this and to it are like this or actually no it's got to be a post-apocalyptic inspired maze so just three of one kind and one of another kind will have to do I'm just gonna weld them to it don't think it will make much of difference on appearance sake it's just how I'm gonna do it we're gonna do the handle part with some paracord I just got this piece leftover Barre chord and I'll think that will do just fine so for the wrapping you start at the top or at the bottom in this case then bring it all the way over to the top of the wrap you're gonna hold it there keep finished with one finger wrap it around one time wrap it over itself so dolt itself in place and just start wrapping it around over the Strand that goes to the bottom she ran out of paracord before the wrap is finished and there's really easy fix for that you just stick your second strand of paracord you heat up the ends push them together like this and then with some scissors or something you just push them together so the molten ends will be flat together and you can also watch your fingers and then roll them around so they'll have a very tight seal and it won't be any bigger than the rest of the airport well that she threw those things together make sure you first let your fingers since the molten plastic is very erotic stick to your fingers and give you some nasty burns to finish off the wrap just tied off with a simple knot and then since she ends and put them flat against the barre chord and now the handlebar is done well this sure as hell couldn't be that effective already good to make it even meaner gonna attach the blades to the sides which look what I got in the mail today the parts of my wallet that were broken and those are the spares I just installed one of them on my welder so you know what that means I can continue building the head of the mace my welding isn't really the best so don't judge me too harshly on that I just got my new welder it's still really hard for me to make even the simplest line or the simplest hooks together but to make it a little bit easier for myself you can kind of lay any blades of the head on a piece of wood so they are already at level and under correct height on the base divided in eighths already and it's really easy to see where the fins are supposed to go to make sure we can secure that in tightly later I'm first gonna make a cut in the top part right there not all the way just this part so when the ring is on tightly I can put a wedge in between and hammer it in really tight so the wood will go to the outside make it and make the ring fit on really tight and really snugly so now let's get to welding now they did but between two pieces of the same thickness of wood so the other one will become perfectly perpendicular with this one for the last two fins attached to the device so I could reach it better it would stay more in place and I didn't have to go to the trouble of building one up all the time well I just spent 50 minutes forgetting what to do because my well they didn't work again a little tip before you start - well don't forget to give me the clamps now what I have to do is clean up all the ugly welds I made which are basically all of them since I can't work properly and I'm not gonna take a lot of time doing that I will probably just pile it a little bit down so it won't stick out as much but it won't take a lot of time to do that because first of all it's hard work and second of all it's post-apocalyptic Ghana post-book the post-apocalyptic kind of maze so it should look a little off so it's also not a really problem if it looks a little rushed or it looks a little filed down or scratch that's just because of the post-apocalyptic that's just because of the post-apocalyptic team so I just made this wedge to hammer into the top of the maze and as you can see now the top mushroomed out making it nearly impossible for your head of the mace to come up and now the Mesa is basically finished but for aesthetic purposes I'm gonna wrap the handle up with some masking tape wrap the top up with some masking tape and just hit it with a few coats of paint would you look at that I live in the Netherlands and it isn't even raining this is gonna make my job a lot easier because now I can just spray paint outside to paint this mace I'm gonna be using a primer first and when that's right I'm gonna go with with a matte black now for the third and the first go to matte black the thing I love about matte paint is you can easily see when it's dried because when it's still wet it still has the kind of glossy look but when it's finally dry you can really see the matte effect on it you can still see it has the glossy look to it it washes right till the all flat black look guys this actually pretty cool because of the two different colors of paint I used it looks like I accidentally sprayed salt and pepper over my fingers since it has been officially too dark to even film out here I need to go inside the Sun has said hey you're gonna have to do with the crappy indoor light now the last step of this process is just removing the masking tape and then it's officially finished and these are the final dimensions of the mice as you can see it's 50 centimeters long the handle part is the 70 centimeters long the head with is 11 centimeters long and the length between the points of two opposing fins is 15 centimeters long it's very stiff heavy like a maze should be and I think it's damn I pretty good and there you have to finish product I really enjoyed this build mainly because of the way he had came out the welding was pretty hard to do but I managed to get it pretty good with the black paint and the black handle and the solid wooden handle part I think it looks really nice I want to ask all of you guys to please share this video with at least one of your friends so they can also see how I built these weapons thank all of you guys for tuning in and watching till the end of this video I'll see you guys in my next project bye you",

A while back, I shot a video about whether you could be having estrogen dominance, so if you're not sure about that, make sure to head on over to that video. And it's in that video that I promised to follow up but you know, life got crazy. But, here is evidence to the fact that I haven't forgotten about you and I haven't forgotten about my promises so any other video I have ever promised, it's coming, we just don't know when. But today, I'm fulfilling this promise and we're talking about how you can lower your estrogen starting today. So if I see estrogen dominance in someone's case, that often makes me think about the thyroid possibly being sluggish. So here I go promising another video but that is really gonna come out soon because I've already written out a draft and that's about how you can improve thyroid function. So I'm not gonna discuss that fully in this video, but it's just really important for you to be aware of the fact that when you struggle with estrogen dominance this could also be down to a sluggish thyroid and a few hints of you possibly having a sluggish thyroid is that you struggle with your weight, that you are overweight or that it's really hard for you to get the weight off that you feel really tired, very cold frequently when other people clearly aren't, and that you have a clouded mind. Now these symptoms could point towards something else but they can also be clues of an underactive thyroid. If you wanna start at looking how to improve your thyroid today, then I would recommend that you head over to one of my videos on how to nurture your adrenals because a sluggish thyroid is often a reaction to adrenals that have been struggling for a long time. So, if you've had a really stressful life and I guess most of us do, then as a result, your thyroid can kind of slam the brakes. So, start taking care of your adrenals and head on over to that video. But first, finish watching this one, right, obviously. So as I said, a sluggish thyroid leads to a slower metabolism and this is the reason that often underactive thyroid patients feel cold and they struggle with the weight because they are not actually getting rid of the fat. If your thyroid is sluggish, that also slows down the metabolism of your liver and we need a healthy liver to get rid of toxins first of all but also for a healthy hormone balance. So what happens if the liver isn't functioning properly because of the thyroid being underactive or because the liver itself is being stressed, that means that estrogen builds up in the body. So estrogen that you should normally be getting rid of with a healthy metabolism, it just builds up and that gives you all the estrogen dominance symptoms. So although a sluggish liver can be the result of a sluggish thyroid, you can imagine that your liver in itself could be struggling for several reasons. One is actually an emotional reason. If you are harboring anger and you aren't resolving that, that puts stress on your liver. I did a really cool video with Helen Suter a while back on how anger and holding onto it can actually impact your fertility. So I will link that one in as well. You see how an emotional thing that you're holding onto can have a physical impact, so a way to lower the impact on your liver is to resolve your anger. There are a couple of other things that can help your liver though. If you've been drinking a lot of alcohol in the past or you've been smoking, that has put pressure on your liver. So if you haven't cut that out already, do that right away. Smoking, you'll wanna cut out anyway if you are trying to conceive, but alcohol we want to at least cut down if we don't cut it out completely. Another thing that puts stress on your liver is any kind of toxin so that can be drugs. If you're taking drugs over the counter a lot, reconsider if it's really necessary. If you're taking prescription drugs, make sure that you talk to your health practitioner who's prescribed them before you cut that down or cut it out. Maybe you're starting to understand what actually took me so long to shoot this video because a lot of the causes of estrogen dominance are linked in. And here's another linked in one, and that is if you're holding onto fat. So it's really important to start exercising if you're not already and also to look at your diet if you haven't done that yet. Because if you're holding onto fat, that also increases estrogen in your body because fat produces estrogen. However, if you are struggling with an underactive thyroid, you are struggling with your weight so I can understand that if you have an underactive thyroid, that it makes you really disheartened to think well, if I'm gonna hold onto the fat and that's going to make me estrogen dominant, then where do I start? Just start somewhere. If you are working on your thyroid, that's going to help your fat metabolism but you really need to also work on making sure that you're moving around enough and you're not slouching on the couch with a bag of potato chips in your hands. Know that if you're exercising and watching your diet, it's also going to help your thyroid. And it doesn't take that much, you don't have to sign up to a gym, you don't have to have the perfect outfit, you don't need to get the perfect DVD, just start with 15 minutes of movement a day. I've been looking into Fly Lady a lot lately and I love one of her quotes, \"You can do anything for 15 minutes.\" set your timer, just move. Start running up and down the stairs or start stretching on the floor. Go for a walk. Who cares, start somewhere. Here's another issue that can be caused by a sluggish thyroid but can also be a symptom that you're having separately from your thyroid, and that is constipation. If you are struggling with constipation, that is also a way that you're holding onto way too much estrogen. So make sure that you keep your digestion as healthy as possible by eating healthy then make sure that your water intake is enough and that you have plenty of fiber in your diet. Now these are a bit of the obvious things. I would really recommend to eat two little prunes a day and not the fresh ones, but I'm talking about the dried ones. Put them in hot water for a little bit to soak up the hot water and take those at night and that should really help most of you. If you're still struggling after that, make sure to look into homeopathic treatment because there are plenty of remedies that can help you with that if it is not related to your thyroid, in which case, you're looking at the thyroid functioning again and boosting that. In a previous video, I shared that it's not really about having too much estrogen in your system or too much progesterone or too much whatever hormone, but that it's always about balance. So when it comes to estrogen, we wanna make sure that there is plenty of progesterone in your system as well at the right time. If you are having normal amounts of estrogen but not enough progesterone, that can also come out as estrogen dominance. So this progesterone boosting video, I will also do in the future because it's getting way too complex otherwise, but it's also coming. Again, I've got a draft for that video already lying on my desk. A big big reason for estrogen dominance I find with the patients in my clinic is that they have taken the contraceptive pill in the past. It doesn't need to just be the pill, it can also be the injection, it can also be the hormonal coil. Anything with synthetic hormones can really throw off our super delicate hormonal system and often the reaction of our system is to become estrogen dominant. And the issue with that is not just the estrogen dominance but years of estrogen dominance can actually lead to having a lack of estrogen in the end. Meaning that you can hit menopause too early or you can have early ovarian failure and a lot of menopausal issues which is way down the line I know for you guys because you're looking at trying to conceive. However it's just really important that you are caring about your estrogen dominance today because it can lead to a lack of estrogen and menopausal issues down the line as well. So we're not just looking at resolving your estrogen dominance so you can actually conceive naturally, but also so that you can hit menopause in a healthy way. There's no reason for us to have hot flashes and feel horrible in that time. If we do, that's usually a result of years and years of neglect of hormonal issues in the first place. What I do with those patients is I detox their hormonal history with homeopathic remedies and before I went on maternity leave, I actually made sure that I got those protocols out there so that you can start detoxing yourself. And I will make sure to also link that in the description below because you can order those protocols today and you can get started with the detox as soon as possible. You don't have to wait to become my patient to get started with that. I've got so many patients that have already fallen pregnant just by detoxing the pill. So it's really worth to get started with that alone as so many of us have the contraceptive pill in our history and not just in our history, but also a lot of us are second generation contraceptive pill users. So even your mom having used contraceptives in the past can have an impact on your fertility today. And here is a last simple step that you can actually start with today really easily as soon as you stop this video and that is that you stop using plastic containers for your food and drinks. It is impossible to eliminate plastic in your system completely because it's really everywhere, but you can reduce it drastically by looking at what is going into your body. And it's important to do that because our bodies recognize plastic as a form of estrogen, so it isn't actually estrogen but we recognize it as such. So a lot of estrogen dominance symptoms can just be because we have too much plastic in our body. Plastics is also something that we can detox homeopathically but I would recommend to get in touch with a homeopath for that. Perhaps in the future I will put up a protocol for detoxing plastics because I've done that plenty with patients as well. If this is something that you would be interested in, make sure to leave that in the comments below because if I see that there's a lot of interest, it is something that I can bump up on my to-do-list for you. All right, that was a lot of information, right? It was an old school Fleur jam packed video but I really wanted to get this out to you and I so much hope that it's helpful. I would love to know in the comments if it was.

        "video_title": "DermTV - Perleche: Cracked Corners of Your Mouth [DermTV.com Epi #156]",
        "video_sub_title": "[music] Hello, I\u2019m Dr. Neal Schultz [pause] and welcome to DermTV. Itching and burning cracks right at the corners of the mouth is kind of common, it\u2019s uncomfortable, and it\u2019s called perl\u00e9che. Because of the cracks, most people think it\u2019s dry skin, but it\u2019s not dry skin. It\u2019s actually caused by a yeast infection, and it\u2019s the same yeast that most women carry in their body and the same yeast that causes them uncomfortable itching yeast infections. Because this is caused by a yeast, it is aggravated by moisture, because yeast thrive in moist areas and closed areas, and this is a perfect set-up because at the corners of the mouth, the way the lips come together, they cause a closed area and, if there\u2019s any saliva there, that accounts for additional moisture. When people get this, invariably they do two things that make it worse. The first is, because they consider it to be dry because they see a crack, they put a moisturizer on and, again, moisture makes the yeast grow even more. Secondly, because it\u2019s uncomfortable, and it burns, and it really feels peculiar, a lot of people take the tip of their tongue and they go like this. And they do it to test it, to feel it, to see, is the problem still there and, interestingly, people do it very often, a couple of times a minute, it\u2019s just a natural reflex. So how do we cure this problem? The first thing is obviously stop licking the corners of your mouth. The second is, get an over-the-counter anti- yeast medicine, such as Lotrimin which has clotrimazole as the active ingredient which is good to fight yeast. Put a little bit on the corners of your mouth four to six times a day, just a very small amount, and then put a little Vaseline or Aquaphor on top so, if you do accidentally touch it with the tip of your tongue, the Aquaphor or Vaseline will keep the moisture away from the problem. Give it four to seven days to cure the problem. If it hasn\u2019t done that by that period of time, then you should see a dermatologist who will give you a prescription for an anti-yeast in an ointment vehicle which again will help protect against additional moisture which aggravates the problem.",

Jeanne Galloway and I'd like to talk to you about how to reduce a fever naturally when a child or when yourself ends up with a feverish condition oftentimes the first thing we want to do is relieve the suffering because they feel so miserable and although that seems like a really good thing to do one of the things that we need to keep in mind is that fevers are actually the body's method of killing off bacterial or viral infections so to some extent we want to be careful not to squelch a fever before it's time if we do that we may actually be prolonging the disease process so that's one thing to keep in mind but if someone is truly just miserable or if you're starting to get a little bit nervous because the temperature for a child maybe is edging up towards 104 you're like oh I'm getting a little scared then what we might want to do there's a few little tricks that can be done naturally that can help with this and help them feel more comfortable certainly you can do baths a nice tepid bath so it's not too cold because you don't want to get them chilled and you certainly don't want a hot bath but a tepid bath and if you put something like lavender essential oil in it or maybe some vinegar just something to be cooling to the body that might be a really good choice to bring down that fever to a more manageable level without taking something like acetaminophen which will artificially decrease the fever other things you can do is boy you've got to hydrate the doctors always said you know drink your juices drink your fluids take your aspirin and call me in the morning well the aspirin maybe not so much but how about the liquids let's get the liquids in because if we are having a fever typically we're dehydrating our bodies our bodies are really heating up it's like you're in a hot day and you're sort of sweating internally so we want to be sure to keep you hydrated you know herbal teas are really a good thing to use for children you might want to use something like chamomile tea because it's really a nice sweet taste a lot of times you don't have to put any kind of sweetener in it at all because the kids will enjoy it just as is so herbal teas water try to avoid super-sweet things it's really not the time to be drinking a lot of soda pop when you're having a fever it's a really poor idea because along with not killing off the bacteria because the fever is going down you're also giving food to that fever you're giving it sugar and is going to make the bacteria or the viral infection grow even faster so we want to try to avoid sweet things we want to try to get good clear liquids and broths and things that are going to keep the body hydrated so there are a number of things that you can do naturally to reduce a fever and if you are concerned at any time about the fever or if a fever for a child goes undiminished for three days you really want to see your practitioner as soon as possible and be sure that the child is evaluated",

        "video_sub_title": "Being a dermatologist, an advanced lifter, and experienced with TRT I give you in this video expert advise on How to reduce PIP. I get asked very often How To Reduce Post Injection Swelling and How to reduce Post Injection Pain? Well, here it is: How to manage swelling and pain at injection site? First you have to realize that most reactions to TRT injections will be temporary, and will probably not cause any serious problems. However, if any doubt, go find yourself a medical doctor that can help you out. This is only general advise, and without studying the skin up close, it is impossible to give any personalized advice. Next, it is important to make a distinction between an infection and purely inflammation. Signs of infection are -next to redness, swelling and pain- systemic reactions like fever and/or the presence of pus at the injection site. This can be under the form of a pustule or an abscess. In case of an infection, you really need to go see a doctor to get a prescription of local and/or systemic antibiotics. If there is only inflammation, under the form of redness, swelling, pain, and the feeling of a hard subcutaneous nodule or lump, then the following actions can be taken. You can be conservative, and just wait it out. In most cases, the inflammation reaches its maximum after one to two days, and then slowly fades down. The whole process can take up to 2 weeks. Sometimes a painless subcutaneous lump can still be palpitated months after the injection. Next, applying cold (like a cold compress) can calm down the inflammation. You can for example apply cold compresses twice a day for half an hour. Local application of creams, containing (the anti-inflammatory) cortisone can be very helpful. Systemically an antihistamine drug can help with the swelling, a painkiller can of course help with the pain (type paracetamol or aspirin, if you\u2019re not allergic to it), and a NSAID (Non Steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) can be useful to fight the pain, the swelling and the redness. Most people are familiar with over-the-counter, nonprescription NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen. NSAIDs are more than just pain relievers. They also help reduce inflammation and lower fevers. Okay, that\u2019s about it for this video. If you are experiencing Post Injection Pain and Swelling right now, I really hope this video was helpful for you. Please leave further questions or comments under the video. I try to answer everything every day.",

        "video_title": "How to Identify Anemia? | MCV vs. MCH | NCLEX Review | Christina NP",
        "video_sub_title": "anemia let's discuss it as an umbrella term if we can understand anemia then we can know how to treat the different types of anemia I want to take you on a segment on how to understand lab values and interpret findings of anemia in a very easy way that helped me tremendously in my career my name is Cristina a nurse practitioner let's get started so anemia is a deficiency in red blood cells within the red blood cells it contains the hemoglobin that helps transport oxygen to vital organs the lifespan of a red blood cell is about a hundred and twenty days red blood cells are produced from the bone marrow along with white blood cells and platelets so remember this nursing pearl anemia is never a normal finding always suspect something is going on now with anemia you can differentiate it into two categories to help you process how anemia differs I use the terms under production versus destruction so under production is when the bone marrow is not making enough red blood cells this can be a series of reasons such as nutritional deficiency such as vitamin b12 or iron deficiency having cancer and receiving chemo can cause a chemo suppression which results in anemia or anemias of chronic disease such as chronic renal failure which can cause low levels of European and also aplastic anemia so as a RN we look at our patients labs and review the hemoglobin and hematocrit trends but we need to be cognizant of a few other labs that are very important one of those is your reticulocyte count so this is your first step so your reticulocyte count tells you the ability of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells the number is really dependent on the hemoglobin level of the patient so it varies from patient to patient however let's say on average your normal number can range anywhere from 1 to 2% so if the reticulocyte count is on the lower side it means your bone marrow is not producing enough red blood cells so there's a under production so on the other spectrum of destruction your reticulocyte count would be higher than normal it tells you your bone marrow is producing too much red blood cells and they're getting destroyed so going back to under production versus destruction I want to now focus on under production so we understand the bone marrow is not producing enough red blood cells so with that said with any anemia we classify it by size and color remember that of the red blood cells so the size of the red blood cell is your M CV which is your mean corpuscular volume and the color of your red blood cell is your MCH which is your mean corpuscular hemoglobin this tells you the amount of hemoglobin contained within the red blood cell so let's talk about your M CV which again is size so first size of RBC's you have the following with acidic it means cell so microcytic small cell is defined as your lab value that is less than 80 normo siddik which is your normal size cell would be between eighty to ninety six and macrocytic is your large cell which is greater than ninety six so let's talk about MCH which is color as chromic it means color which is the amount of hemoglobin so let's learn the terms hypochromic is low color normal chromic is normal color and hyperchromic is a lot of color so if you ever had a microcytic hypochromic anemia it would include iron deficiency anemia and thalassemia anemia a normal siddik normal chromic anemia is related to anemia of chronic disease and to include another important lab value would be your Rd W which is your red blood cell distribution with this is your standard size think about like going to a donut shop and you have a standard glazed donut size every once in a while you may have something that is not usually a typical size so it would be greater than 15% now as a RN how do you know when someone has anemia one definitive way to diagnose is through a lab specimen report however let's say in the morning the labs were within normal range then mid Junoon came and the patient is feeling fatigued your patient's heart rate is tachycardic and some other symptoms of anemia could also include fatigue weakness shortness of breath chest pain tachycardia like we just mentioned cool extremities maybe having some light jaundice because of the destruction of red blood cells so now what so number one I want you to think about who is your patient are they older usually elderly have a normally low H&H which runs on the lower side and is medically termed idiopathic anemia of Aging you don't want to assume that every patient that is elder always has a lower HNH and number two you also want to consider your patient that may live in a high altitude area if they smoke or have COPD because they may have polycythemia so get some labs there could be a change may be clinically you're not seeing active blood loss but your nursing senses should be heightened and request some labs to get drawn another NCLEX tip you want to always make sure you do a peripheral smear this is used when a patient has a mixed anemia to help diagnose so some nursing interventions you would want to consider blood product transfusion for the patient that may be in a queue or chronic State you want to make sure you control the bleed and last you want to offer foods that they may be deficient in such as vitamin b12 iron or folate again thank you so much for

        "video_title": "SHBG and TRT-Should you  Lower SHBG on TRT and How to Lower SHBG and Should you Lower SHBG on TRT?",
        "video_sub_title": "so many men or some men are very fortunate to have you know a decent amount of total testosterone but there SHBG is stubbornly high and for these men they end up having very low free testosterone but have you ever wondered how can you get your your shbg down even lower and why would you want to get it down in order to have optimal free tea so we're going to discuss this keep watching and subscribe to the channel and we've been back after this hello so it's Sam and Mike here from balance my hormones so in this video we're going to discuss how to lower SHBG now there's two two situations here there's how to lower tier SHBG of your on trt and how because there's discussion in both of these sides and also how you might lower shbg when not on first of all there is a bit of controversy in the trt community about why would you even want to lower shbg in the first place yeah that's true so I think the the I mean there's an argument both ways I think in the UK particularly doctors would try and lower SHBG this high to get more free testosterone from the amount of testosterone you're given right because they can't keep going up and up and up well but also because I think there's a there's a desire to try to preserve the pituitary axis without having to put someone on full TRT yeah all the time and you know sometimes or many times people end up having to go on for TRT but at least they've tried this the step therapy yeah okay so what is that consist of normally so in the UK and in some other countries then I have in America there is providing master alone which is a DHT derivative medication and it can be taken in low doses it can low SHBG in some men it can be suppressive over certain dosages so get not on trt it may lower your SHBG but it might end up lowering your total testosterone as well so you're chasing your tail in those scenarios yeah you know it's coming down SHBG but the amount of free tea isn't really going up that much mmm because the total was coming but have you seen cases where a couple of guys I know actually who got treated by the doctors one guide to what 25 milligrams of provirus and for about a year he had really really good total testosterone SHBG dropped quite considerably free testosterone obviously went up because of that and when I say really really good total he didn't get pressed and his east region was good so LH and FSH were were normal yeah they're words okay yep so no suppression of LH and FSH total testosterone hovering around what it was before he started SHBG lowered and Tess Foster Friess Australian increased that did actually wear off and it started started basically SHBG climb back up obviously if you start going higher with provider in and it can obviously lower and suppress more he's actually ended up being on CRT but he had a year of before trt and ultimately the main thing was his symptoms so my we retrieved yeah so my understanding that SHBG is usually going up because there's something going on with the liver usually non-alcoholic fatty liver disease I think it's one of the causes but maybe not the only cause of elevation in shbg and so ideally if you can fix the problem with you know non-alcoholic fatty liver disease the thought would be well maybe there's hbg would come down and I think we'll have another topic just about that yeah but and actually pentoxifylline according to some papers can actually improve non-alcoholic fatty liver disease yeah but there's no assurance that it's going to fix your shbg level not that it's a problem in and of itself it's just that you know one would want to find the best way to bring down the shbg so they wouldn't necessarily have to go on full TRT you know it's also a replacement button and that's for those guys who are an intact pituitary what about those guys who are on trt but testosterone isn't enough to bring down the SHBG yes i mean i think in in most in most cases you don't need to try and bring down SHBG on trt right that's is something that is done for certain reasons as i explained before in the UK for example you can't just give more testosterone so maybe in the US and some cash play sort of practices they may just give more testosterone right to get more total testosterone get over that higher shbg give you more free testosterone estrogen and actually get your symptom resolution but in the UK doctors are sort of you know scrutinized and monitored so they can't keep giving more testosterone so they may give provided a longside trt but to lower it frequency of injection and the amount in each injection may play a role in freeing up more free testosterone I point during shbg yet so whilst your main focus may not be to lower shbg on its own it's just a byproduct yeah of you know of your dosing regime so for someone who has a higher shbg what do you think the best treatment regime or a treatment protocol would be well often actually less frequent and more so if you compare it to like a daily or a twice weekly or every other day or something changing from Matt to going to maybe the same total dose over the week but five six seven days and then that change in the sort of dynamic of the of the injection to come for some bring nanus hbg in itself by increasing free to sausage I've seen that which is you know and on the on the flip side if someone has a lower s HPG that's often why you know going to that sort of daily dosing or you know cream three times a week dosing yeah you know what have a more frequent basis ain't lower days right well we can talk about that on a different frequency protocol but so really yes so it's summarizing what you said what you asked was basically shbg on trt it is going to be lowered if that's what the way where you have to go with it with a doctor provider and can do that or changing a dosing schedule but that shouldn't be the area focus the shbg it's i think it's something to identify mm-hmm it's a way to for the doctor to fine-tune your treatment based on where your SHBG is but it's not the overriding goal or mission the overriding mission is to you know fix the symptoms of the nation yeah and and to optimize the testosterone levels and and by doing that it should normalize yeah the SHBG and when SHBG is high i guess there may be some underlying causes yeah like fatty liver disease or something else going on but having SHBG you need SHBG you know when things get really really low on the SHBG some guys can struggle to you know to managed testosteron going in the body right either excretes it fast or they feel a bit unstable so there's still some unknowns about the benefits potentially of SHB to you I mean shbg just doesn't bind to testosterone but there's also some you know other binding proteins that also bind the thyroid mm-hmm and you know perhaps I think we're finding some other studies showing SHBG may reach the cell but we're not trying with tests Australian and together they have an interaction you know with the cell but it's this is the thing though this is this is not it's not clear-cut you can have some some people with lower SHP G's that you wouldn't think would tolerate you know five six seven day dosing protocol if you just looked at SHBG but they feel great and vice versa you know you get guys who are on a more frequent protocol maybe they've got a higher SHBG but they feel great and this is where it's just not blood test numbers right you think you're treating the symptoms so it might be you know through your journey of trt you might tried dosing frequencies you might try things potentially like provider something or dosing changes to lower shbg ultimately is symptom resolution as the goal I mean ya know we've dialed into the right dose so yeah I think that's really helpful and you know even age can raise SHBG it's covered natural part of aging but the testosterone treatment tends to keep it in check gates oh thanks

        "video_title": "How to & Tips about Strip Lashes & Individuals, too!!",
        "video_sub_title": "hi so I finally got around to making this last videos I normally put my lashes on probably is one of the last things I do like far as my eyes go I always do them after my eyeshadow because i find that for me personally it's easier some people put them on before but i find that it is harder to like work around the lashes while they're on there ok so for this trip one these are our dull whiskey's and you can get these at Sally's or you can get them cheaper anywhere online just look up our dell with these me personally i could get maybe like 79 uses out of one pair so after the way that i take care of them is after i peel them off I pick the glue off so if you can see there so glue left over because I wanted to show that and just with my fingers and I tell this to my clients too if they want to save your lashes holding your fingers like this and then just take your two fingers here gently pull off just pick it off so here's the lashes all completely cleaned off here's all before and after here is before with the glue on it and here's after you can see it's a little less gunky in this area the glue that I use is duo eyelash adhesive not to be confused with the duo surgical glue that maxvill um the surgical glue can be a little bit more I guess they say a little bit harsh on more sensitive eyes so that's why I stick with eyelash adhesive since its for the eye area and what I'm going to do now is just you can some people squirt a little dot on their hand and run their last strip along but I like to go straight from it so just squeeze it on to the lodge also me personally again this is personal i like to add mascara and curl my lashes just a little bit just a little bit of curl that it gives it kind of like your lashes will naturally like hold or support the false ones that you put on so that's why i like to curl 94 and then just with some tweezers or whatever you use you can use your fingers i liked we just because it's a bit more precise and then get it as close as possible and then I always put the middle down first and then I go to the side as lashes and as you can see it's a little bit white but it will dry clear I don't really like the glue that dries dark because sometimes I mess up and I'll get like glue like on my shot I shadow up here so if it were dry dark then I would have to peel the cool off and then I'd be a big spot missing in my iphone just too much so I like the clear and yeah so that's it so wait for that to dry also i forgot to mention after you put the glue on your lashes you can wait maybe like 5 to 10 seconds so the glue gets a little more tacky and you can take it in your tweezers and just kind of wave it around so it dries a little bit because you don't want to put it on there like immediately immediately also another question that I got was if you have really really really curly lashes so curly that they almost curl into your actual eyelid what I found helps is to take like a smaller brush or just some kind of Brussels to pretend this is a little brush and then take it behind your lashes like the curly lashes and then to pull them down my pretend these are these are my natural lashes so pull them down and then apply your lashes going to be a little bit more tricky but I promise you it should get the job done and of course there's no need for you to curl your lashes before putting the strips on because you've already been blessed with Supergirl now for the individuals and these i got from Sally's Beauty Supply these or I believe these are our dell these are just medium length and they're black I really like the individual so much because they take more time and I'm would much rather or get a fuller effect it's just quicker for me but if you wanted to know same thing take your tweezers just gently pull and again same thing my lashes already curled get the tiniest little dot of glue onto the end you can see it that's up probably too much and then just glue it on to your lash line not to your lashes but just along the lash line and basically just keep going till you get it to where you want it and another I think misconceptions people have our like facing they can sleep in these gear the full strip or the individual ones i would not recommend sleeping in any of these because they're temporary so they're not permanent or semi-permanent whatsoever I always fully recommend before you go to bed or anything like that we're moving completely removing everything from your face and washing your face and then just you know like I said earlier you can save your lashes not so much the individuals because I mean what's the point unless you really want to save them I guess you could but I would recommend never ever ever sleeping in your makeup or sleeping and lashes because it it's just asking for trouble so there be individual there are the individuals and these on the left the full ship so you can see I can definitely see the difference because these are a little bit longer moving more fuller and these are way more on the natural side so if you want to do more of like an everyday thing but still have like nice like truly natural and fullness and length to it I would definitely recommend individual also as they dry or after they fully dry you can either take some liquid liner or cake liner and drag it across the lash line again just to help conceal or kind of cover up the band so it doesn't show so it just looks like it's blending in with the lightener when you're done just feel a loss and that's it hope it helped thanks for watching I you",

        "video_sub_title": "Choosing the best backpack sprayer can be an easy process if you use these five considerations. Pump type Pump location Electric vs. manual Metal vs. plastic components Design style And in today's video we'll cover each so you can get the backpack sprayer you need. Let's first start with pump type. In general you have two options here - Piston Pump and Diaphragm Pump. Piston pumps are the most popular and are primarily used with liquid formulations. These pumps would not be recommended for use with abrasive sprays or wettable powders. These substances can score the piston and cylinder of the pump causing leaks and shortening the lifespan of the sprayer. If you are spraying abrasive substances, wettable powders, or bleach solutions, you'll want a diaphragm pump backpack sprayer. In addition to being able to handle these liquids, diaphragm pumps generate a lower pressure - below 60 psi - than piston pumps, which results in larger liquid droplets and less spray drift. For more information on the differences between diaphragm and piston pumps, you can click the link in this video to watch our video on this topic. Now that you have an idea of the pump type you need, you'll want to decide where the pump is located. Some sprayers, like the solo sprayers have pumps housed on the outside of the unit. This makes it easier to access the pump and perform maintenance. But if the pump develops a leak, because it is on the outside, this could potentially cause a safety issue by leaking onto the person wearing the sprayer. The pump on other backpack sprayers, like those from Jacto, house the pump on the inside of the tank which eliminates the potential of external leaks. Though, these would require a little more work to access the pump when performing maintenance. If manually pumping your sprayer sounds like too much work, you can choose an electronic version. Most electronic sprayers are powered by a rechargeable battery. With an electric unit, you select from pre-set PSI setting and it maintains desired pressure - no more pumping. You'll also want to decide on metal vs. plastic components. In general, you can expect metal components to be more durable. But, they usually add weight and cost to the sprayer. The next consideration is design. Tank shapes differ from manufacturer to manufacturer, which can impact comfort of the wearer. Straps, hose, wand material and nozzle types should also be looked at when selecting a sprayer. So the considerations when selecting a backpack sprayer are: Pump type Pump location Electric vs. manual Metal vs. plastic components, and Design style When you need a sprayer, parts or accessories, start at gemplers.com - where we have more inventory, in stock.

        "video_sub_title": "hi how are you this is my new YouTube channel right now I might talk about one other subject that I need to speak to you guys because about myself hi everyone and welcome to my channel I feel like it's been forever since I posted a video but it's actually been a week or so but I am so excited to be recording another video for you guys I'm gonna be answering the question that I get asked from a ton of you guys and that's how long does it take for the whole swelling and bloat miss a round your stomach area or your incision area to go down post transplant so I will be answering that question based off of my experience also guys I have some exciting news at the end of this video so stick around but let's continue and already before we continue guys I just want to quickly encourage you guys to subscribe to my youtube channel for weekly videos as well as don't forget to give this video a huge thumbs up if you guys like it [Music] so after you get out of surgery from a kidney transplant I know that you wake up with a lot of pain especially in your abdominal area because the kidney is placed in the abdominal area and there's a lot of tenderness a lot of swelling and a lot of bloatedness and this swelling and brokenness and all that lasts for a pretty long time and I'm gonna be honest and I'm gonna give you guys the answer right now it can last up to a year and I am speaking from my experience it lasts forever it and sometimes I feel like I deal with the whole bloat Knisley even till this day and in February 2000 nineteen healthy two years post transplant so I'm still kind of dealing with this but not to the extent that I was in the beginning in the beginning it's super like really really my stomach was really bloat really puffy and I'm gonna insert a picture and I'm gonna try to look for a picture around my stomach looks now and see if I can find one it takes forever and honestly what I found for me to help to like reduce the whole swelling is to really take natural diuretics I have on my channel a video and I'll link it down below of me doing a juice blend that is super helpful then I truly truly like believe and I'm Trust and I know that that juice has helped me a ton in the whole swelling down process of my transfers especially since I'm on prednisone which Panozzo makes you retain a lot of fluids so it's helped me not only with the whole moon face but also with the whole bloatedness around my transplant area also what helped me was walking and doing as much as daily exercise as I could now that I'm going to the gym I feel a lot better as well the whole swelling has gone down completely in a matter of fact my transplant area the decision I was always having a ton of pain on it and it was constant and I actually mentioned it to my doctor and my doctor told me that I was going to have that pain forever and he said it was normal that that was going to be there forever so I believed him but guess what guys it's gone and it's been gone for I want to say four or five months but that's because I've been exercising the pain actually went away after I exercise and I actually mentioned it to my other like doctor or nurse I don't really know what she is I think she's a doctor my other doctor that I see at my infusion clinic and she and I was telling her how like ever since I've been working out the pain around my transplant area has reduced by a tiny and she said it's most likely because the muscles have kind of got like they got themselves used to the kidney and the transplant being there so they kind of adjusted itself and it makes so much more sense that like I truly believe that my body has gotten used to the whole transplant being there and I feel so much better since I've been eating better and really taking care of my body so those are some two little tips that I wanted at their window to really watch what you're eating to help with that bluntness and also to help with some pain do some workouts try to get your body used to the transplant being there so to conclude this video this video is extremely short I know it's like probably gonna be two or three minutes long pain does lasts for more than a year and you kind of just have to be patient with it because I know it can be really dreadful like not being able to fit into certain things especially because for me I'm always an apple-shaped body I've always had even when I was skinny but always have a bigger top half of my body rather than my legs my legs have always been kind of thin so yes it can get a little frustrating but you just have to be patient because it will go away on its own if you're doing like the little tips that I mentioned but eating right and kind of getting your body used to it also for the exciting news that I mentioned in the intro of this video is that I'm actually going to be going on a cruise so I will be vlogging that experience for you guys so you guys will be seeing some travel blogs it's different honestly I I truly do not know what to expect I'm always going on like planes and traveling and stuff and I do have on my channel like that whole experience and like talking about things that I do as a transplant patient while traveling so let's see if it changes with the cruise guys I'm excited and I'm nervous at the same time and the funny thing is I'm never nervous for a trip but I've never seen the simple fact that it's gonna be my first time on a cruise since a transplant I've been on a cruise before but this was years years ago I was probably like 14 when I went so it's gonna be completely different I'm excited I'll be going with Anthony and Emery my daughter so definitely get ready for some travel blogs also guys I do want you guys to know that I read everybody's comments and I try to respond to as many comments as I can my comments just fill up and I want to reach out to everybody because I just love answering comments comments if you guys find it helpful for me to do like a video some sort of reading everybody's comments and then just answering to it let me know in the comments down below and I'll most likely do one or even if you guys want to do like like leave some questions down below then I can definitely do like a kidney transplant or a Pinni disease journey like Q&A for you guys because the comments just overflow and I want to answer everyone's questions that I want to talk to each and every one of you guys but it's just so hard sometimes like just type it and type it in typing so yes once again thank you guys for watching and have a blessed and beautiful day everyone",

        "video_sub_title": "hi everyone my name is Kelly Flannery and I'm the owner of retro luxe hair salon boutique in Perea Iowa and today I'm going to be doing a tutorial on how I dry my hair what I want to have a curly as you can see I don't really have a defined curl it's just a little wavy um I just got out of the shower and I'm going to show you the products that I've already put in it now my hair is really frizzy so if I don't put a lot of hair product in it it just is a big frizzy mess it doesn't define the curls so I started out with this stuff I got this at Walmart thought I would try it out I just got it this weekend so this will be the first time I'm using it um while trying to get my hair curly so it's just like souffle kind of creamy kind of stuff it smells really good smells awesome it reminds me a pina colada so I put that in it then I put some Tresemme curl care flawless curls extra hold miss um and you would be surprised at the amount I probably use three handfuls of mousse in my hair to start out with and then I'm going to part my hair kinda sorta and make sure all the product is through it 100% now the trick with diffusing your hair is the less you touch your hair the better because every time you touch your hair your hair is going to frizz out so go ahead and start scrunching your hair like so after you brush it and get all the product through it and then I'm going to spray some Herbal Essence Toslink spray JA having is this either so we'll see how it works I wanted to do a video on store-bought product because I know not everybody can afford salon products so I wanted to show you that you can use salon products and get the same look that idea now I do use professional products most of the time so but you can pretty much use whatever you want so I'm spraying my image real good and my bread's because my reg tend to get physique now okay so now that that's done I have a tool like this which is called Anna fuser and I'm using the Chi lowing low EMF um hair dryer and you just dry it 100% just like this the other I [Music] and I dry my hair 100% like this either this way completely upside down in your hair it's right inside the diffuser you just push it up and the more you move it around the more volume you're gonna get so how much volume you want on how much you actually kind of move it around you can see my hair's already kind of starting to curl just a little bit so I'm finished and I'll be back I wanted to point one thing out real quick if you don't like lots of volume you really just want to dry your hair about probably 80% of the way and then let it dry the rest lay on the cells you really like a lot of volume like I do I'd ride 100% and I also dry it upside down if you just want a little volume just dry it like over to the side but I'm going to put my head up slightly upside down like this to dry it the rest the way to get a lot of volume [Music] okay so if you want you can just leave it like this and let it finish air drying but I like my hair to be a little bit bigger than this so I'm going to actually spray it down just a little bit more up here on the roads sent out to touch it too much because it's going to get frizzy if you do you don't want to run your fingers through it at all until it's 100% dry and I'm going to finish air drying it the way I like and I'll be back bigger more i dry it so here's my hair 100% dry so um you can start touching it down you can see how curly and defined the curls are I use some of this Kikuchi oil I got from Walmart it's called organic I like the dry oil because it's not as oily and it absorbs into my hair and it looks just makes my hair nice and soft and shiny and I also use it as a curling iron spray so you can either use it keep your hair like this nothing or I put like a little side braid in then I put some hairspray in it or I put a headband on you know I have these cute little headbands that I bought I got one I got this at JC Penney's I got this that um hot topic I got this one at Walmart which I really like it's like a double banded headband I got this one at this cute little boutique Geico too called breeches and bows it's cute I wear a lot of head bands in the summer because I like it off my face so I'm gonna finish styling my hair and I'll come back and show you the end results okay so my hair is all dried I have put some hairspray in it I've used Paul Mitchell super extra clean because I really love this hairspray it's a nice bear spray and I went through and just kind of fluff it a little bit okay so now I'm going to do just a cute little twist in the front so you take a piece of hair like so and you split it in half and you take the front over the back you twist the front over the back and then you add hair just like you would for your French braiding pick up another piece of hair and you add it to the back piece and you cross it over the front so the front goes over the back and I go down about so far and I finish twisting it I lift some of this hair out and I put it under here like so and I kind of push it up I take a bobby pin and I stick it in and it stays like that oh well that didn't stay very good let's see so take a bobby huh I might have to since my hair so curly do the crossover the bobby pins like so so you put them like this and then I just kind of flip that hair over to hide it my hair's still a little damp so when it dries I can scrunch it a little bit more and that's it it's kind of like a beachy castle lady kind of thing thanks for watching my youtube page take care I will be having some more hair videos on how to do hair styles and I might if I get courageous enough I'll try to do some makeup tutorials also thank you for watching goodbye",

        "video_sub_title": "you know walking with crutches is hard enough you have to watch out for stubbing your good toe on the on the crutch or tripping over unseen obstacles or taking corners it's all like a whole new learning experience and that goes you know good nothing but always be on the lookout for the unexpected and going up the stairs I've made a lot of mistakes in the beginning because I was sort of jumping up each stair and a good friend of ours Erik physiotherapist at the hospital in Delft - that are near the rough he gave you some great tips on how to get upstairs and well I'm going to share them with you now thing is not to jump up the stairs not to like just you know jump what you want to do is one crutch on the side you know if you're grab your railing I'll show you that in a moment your left crutch in this case and I left leg in the good leg luckily in this case you don't jump but you lift your weight on the crutch lift your weight right arm and my left arm especially and lift the weight up lift the weight up so plant your correction good position and lift your leg up and lift your leg up you see my hand is in my arm in this case I have a good railing for that I put my weight on the railing in the and the crutch and I'm glad I did this railing right when we repaired the house and it's it's in there strong you know and thank you thank thank God because I'm pretty heavy and then just you know take the hundred kilos and entrust it on your crutch and on the railing and you lift it up bend your knee your good knee give a good motion good exercise for later when you're the walking in and you lift and this is a difficult step but the crunch the railing is a little bit out of the way so in the last step here it would be very careful especially with these European stairs are very narrow on the inside I have to really make a little bit more of a motion but you don't want to jump too much just place it up make sure you're leaning forward so you don't you don't want to be going backwards where's that stair lean for so if you fall you fall forward I'm going to get your other crutch from here from your loving family member and you walk further my left hand is now on the rail my right hand has a crutch same thing plucked it place your crutch well a good position neat to close not too close to the edge and you with your you just kind of let yourself a little bit fall and place your leg down a little bit fall and place your leg down yourself and Asia first you go a little bit forward backward they go straight put my coach nice and sturdy and there's a half and you get your other crutch here and off you go well that's I can get up and down the stairs with your crutches you can see it's a very well it can be a little bit of a scary prospect I'm you know for sure if you're a little bit older or a little bit less enabled it was scary enough for me the first couple times matter of fact my doctor even recommended don't do it I guess they kind of have to say that you know and he sort of said off-the-record well yeah if you have to do it just be careful because the last thing you want to do is fall and then you have you know in my case it might not be able to fix it anymore as good as this you know other people hope the stairs obviously can go on your on your behind and go you know step by step and that's probably the safest way to do it this is not a recommendation on how you should or shouldn't do it just showing you what I learned but anyway I hope it helps you and whatever you do be careful",

        "video_sub_title": "hi my name is John Gibbons and today we're going to look at manipulation as in a high velocity frust which is an osteopathic or chiropractic technique for the c1 on a c2 which is known as the a a joint when we come to assess it then typically we can actually rotate to see how far we can rotate left and right a new neck is a bit stiff but it doesn't really test the a a joint it will just test rotation of a cervical spine so if we were able to flex the patient's relaxed flex the patient when I say flex I probably would tear flex about 30 degrees and then slowly start to rotate if we can't rotate very far left and right and you can see there's a blocking then potentially but you see one on the c2 so you think about this atlas and it sits on the axis and then it's the pivot joint here and then it's considered but when you rotate by neck you have 80 degrees of motion and 50% of the motion I 40 degrees will come from c1 rotating on c2 if you happen to learn the technique then the way I do I come on to the articular pillar here and then the technique is used my mCP joint and then the first would be towards the opposite eye now to be safe I would be in flexion and I would slowly come on to that area and I'm slowly side bending down to the level then I'm gonna slowly start to rotate away here she already binds quite quick not every patient would bind this quick but she seems of buying quite quick here so I'm just gonna feel the lock there I know it's a little tender on her neck and then the frust be careful would be thumb here but for us is going to be towards the opposite eye and you have to be so fast but the distance has to be so small so it's called HVT which is a high velocity frust with a lower amplitude so let me just see if I can cavitate this joint without irritating this neck so we're gonna sign Bend and start to rotate and then there's the bind there so I'm just going to just gently try to move that neck and I tried to do a very fast technique on that one you okay okay yeah yeah that was really stuck yeah that was really stuck there and she did say it was a little tender but on a positive the joint moves quite well there now I am just gonna have a look of his right side so we see how we get on this one so I'm just gonna slowly side Bend and then again this side is jammed as well so from there there's the lock not so stuck but I'm just gonna just gently go just go okay okay that was particularly stiff okay on her neck this was probably one of her sniffers I've treated so I'm just feel the movement but because it's been stuck for a while I hope that she has improvement quite quick in there but the you know the skill sometimes it was hard because I've done all maybe over 100 files and all these necks and it's very rare for the patient to have discomfort but now and again because if it's been stuck you know they should see someone where they are pretty confident and competent under what they do the last thing you'd want to do is manipulate nekke not really sure what's going on so hopefully you know when my skill level yeah it'll be fine but obviously now and again the patient will feel a little bit of discomfort but that's not the goal the goal is to move it without the patient feeling too much and I hope within a short period of time she'll be she'll be fine I hope you enjoyed the video bit nerve-wracking I think for myself and the patient in this case but if you like what do you see and maybe if you can subscribe and I need to see all my videos because you'll automatically get them thanks for watching and I'll see you again",

        "video_sub_title": "welcome to auditory precision my name is Aaron Shaw I'm creating a couple web videos some webinars that will basically help individuals pass the test for the state to become specialists and also for patients that just want to know a little bit more about their hearing loss what we're going to be doing today is different types of audiograms as far as covering conductive sensory neural and mix twenty decibels or above its considered normal the other thing to know about is that when we're dealing with this the reason why twenty is the point that we considered normals because by the time that we're adults we've been around loud noises we've been around ear infections and viruses and even for pediatric cases they should be hearing around 15 for it to be considered most so I guess nobody's born with perfect hearing but the first thing I want to go over is conductive I find it to be the most easy I find it to be the easiest to identify and basically what I'm going to be doing is just utilizing the right ear because I'm utilizing red and so say I have what's considered to be pretty normal an aging hearing loss called presbycusis usually better in the lows slopes in the highs okay and what is important to kind of have here is that before they told you just to do octaves and only mark inter octaves when you had a significant gap between the octaves yhs which is where we're getting most of our information from which updated in December of 2016 basically says to never cut corners they want you to do all octaves and inter octaves and believe me it's easier to put it into NOAA when you put it in your audiogram but for this to be conductive hearing loss my bone scores all have to be perfect okay that means that they either have to be at 20 or better okay if any of these drop below it is no longer conductive hearing loss it might have a conductive component but now we're either going to be looking at sensory neural or we're gonna most likely be looking at mix but again for you to say this patient has purely conductive hearing loss all of their bone scores have to be at twenty or better without moving the air scores that I have in my right ear I'm going to basically show sensory neural sensory neural is basically when my bone scores are going to kind of follow my ear scores okay and I have room of error I can basically be right on point or I can have an air-bone gap of ten five ten that's fine if I have 15 or more well we have two masks and we'll get into masking for bone later on but if it's 15 and we find out that it truly is 15 after masking it is no longer sensory neural sensory neural means my bone scores have to follow my air and they can only deviate from five to ten decibels we're also going to notice that my bone scores will never be worse than my air sometimes that around 500 will notice that this might be lower it's usually because the oscillator is in an incorrect spot and there are very rare situations like Paget's disease where we will see it below on all of them but that will be a pretty rare thing to run into so what I'm going to do is just talk about these two out here saying all of a sudden my bone score gives me an air-bone gap that is 15 or more well I can't just say that that's true because now I have to mask okay and once I'm asked this what I would be doing is that would be placing masking noise into my non-test ear which would be the left ear in this case and I would redo this and to prove that I mask I'm going to be doing utilizing a different symbol and so this shows that I did this basically if you have to mask bone you might as well mask all of them never masks too much okay but it is important that you at least Massie's because we have an air-bone gap of 15 if all of a sudden these are true and they're still at 15 it can no longer be sensory neurone my bone scars aren't perfect my bone scores aren't following my ear scores and I got these two that are a 15 decibel gap I now have mix I have a sensory neural hearing loss with a conductive component and therefore I have mixed hearing loss and that's how you notice the difference between all three",

        "video_title": "Improve Posture with 5 Easy Exercises - Ask Doctor Jo",
        "video_sub_title": "hey everybody it's dr. Jo and Khaleesi queen of the Iron Throne. today I'm going to show you five exercises for better posture. so let's get started. so the first exercise for better posture is a simple chin tuck. and you guys have heard me talk about chin tucks a lot. I really think they're the best exercise for neck pain, posture correction because a lot of times throughout the day we end up bringing our head forward like this. and so to have better posture, you want to bring that chin back in. that's what a chin tuck is. it's not coming down tucking in like this, but it's actually taking your chin and tucking it in where you end up getting lots of little chins. so what you want to do a lot of times what I'll do is just I'll place my finger on my chin, kind of as a target, and so I'm gonna leave my finger in one spot and then pull back my chin to get that chin tuck. just hold it for about 3-5 seconds. doesn't have to be very long and then relax. and usually then you'll have a little bit of space in between your finger which is shows you're correcting that posture a little bit. so it's a nice way just to kind of see how you're doing, but you don't have to. you just want to you know imagine that your whole head is going back behind you and that's a chin tuck where you're bringing it in. again holding it that three to five seconds, maybe just do a 5 at a time and you can do these several times throughout the day. especially if your posture is really bad. especially if you work on a computer all day and you kind of go forward lean forward like that a lot. so then the next one is just kind of adding on to the chin tuck. so you're gonna go into the chin tuck and while you do the chin tuck, you're gonna do a shoulder squeeze or scapular squeeze. and that's just when you're taking those shoulder blades in the back and squeezing them together. so it's almost like you want to imagine that my hand's sitting on your spine and you're trying to squeeze my hand with your shoulder blade. so you're gonna go into the chin tuck, tuck it in, and then squeeze your shoulder blades back. so see I'm over-exaggerating that correct posture, but you want to over exaggerate it to get used to being in that position. so chin tuck in, shoulder squeeze back, hold it for again three to five seconds, and then relax. so with the shoulder squeezes, you're using the muscles to squeeze back you can use your elbows to kind of guide back there, but you're squeezing the muscles. you're not just pushing them back with your elbows. squeezing back, tucking in that chin, holding three to five seconds, doing five or ten a couple times throughout the day. so then again to add on to those to make it a little bit harder, just take a loop resistive band. this one's kind of neat when I was having shoulder therapy several years ago, one of my therapist that I was working with taught me this move. and it's it looks easy, but if you're doing it correctly, it's actually pretty hard. so you're gonna go into the chin tuck, you're going to go into the shoulder squeeze, get your shoulder blades back behind you, elbows are gonna be at your side, and you're gonna put some tension on that band. so you're holding right here. you're tucked in ,you're squeezing back, and then you're gonna shrug your shoulders and come back down. so now you're working those those neck muscles, your levator scapulae, your upper traps, all those kind of things. so again I'm tucking in my chin, squeezing back, putting tension, and keeping my elbows by my side, and then coming up, and coming back down. trying to keep all that together. so again it might look easy, but you have to do all of them together. so if I do this and I'm not getting that shoulder squeeze, I'm not doing it correctly. chin tuck, squeeze back, band with resistance, come on up, come down without bringing that band back in. so again it's harder than it looks. I just start off with five or ten doing those a couple times throughout the day. start off with the lightest loop band that you have. depending on the brand, the colors are different, so just make sure it either says light or you know it's the lightest one because again it's a lot harder than you think. it might you might think it's easy, but if you think it's easy, you're probably not doing it correctly. so the last two are going to be standing with a resistive band. so for the last two exercises you want to anchor a resistive band either, you know, on a door or a mysterious person behind the curtain holding the band. special disclaimer alert, anytime you're pulling the band towards you, especially towards your face, make sure it's anchored properly or the person that's holding on is holding on tight because you don't want it to come back and smack you in the face. so make sure it's anchored before you attempt this at all. we now return you to your regularly scheduled exercise. so this one, this time you want to wrap it around so you have to to hold on to. when I'm doing row type motions, I like to actually stagger my stance. some people will stand like this, but then they tend to want to lean back and arch their back. you don't want to do that. you don't want to work on one thing and then get something else hurting. so this next one is going to be to work the lower traps. so this is a nice exercise again to open up that chest and get that better posture. so you're gonna kind of get in that staggered stance. try and keep your your back fairly straight, and you're gonna do kind of what you would call a face pull. so you're coming up, pulling towards your face, and then you're bringing the band up, coming back down and then bringing it back out, but control that motion. so you want to control the band, don't go fast. really control it to a slow face pull, push up, come back to your face, and then let it out. so this is a lot harder than it looks. so again make sure you're just starting off with five or ten with the lightest band that you have, and then do that a couple times throughout the day. so then the next one is just going to kind of be the other direction. so now you're going to come back into a regular row. thumbs kind of up. you're gonna come into a row. you're gonna bring your hands down, kind of opening your palms away from you, and then slightly pull back behind you. come back in bring them up and then come back in. so I'm doing it step by step, but now this is the motion. so row down, out, in, and that way. so again if you're doing these correctly, they are a lot harder than they look. so make sure you're just starting off with a little bit, and then progressively getting harder. so there you have it those are five exercises for better posture. if you'd like to help support my channel, make sure and click on the link up there, and don't forget to subscribe, Where? right there miss Queen Khaleesi. and remember be safe, have fun, and I hope you feel better soon.",

        "video_title": "Physical Therapy Exercises for Relieving Gas After Hysterectomy",
        "video_sub_title": "Hi I\u2019m Michelle, I\u2019m a physiotherapist, and\u00a0 I often work with women after they've had a\u00a0\u00a0 hysterectomy. One of the problems that ladies\u00a0 often tell me about having is discomfort in\u00a0\u00a0 their abdomen from gas, and it's really hard\u00a0 to shift that gas after the surgery. So I\u00a0\u00a0 thought today that I\u2019d show you some really simple\u00a0 exercises that you can do after your hysterectomy\u00a0\u00a0 to help you shift the gas and relieve that gas\u00a0 pain, without having to take other medications\u00a0\u00a0 and things like that. So let's get started,\u00a0 I\u2019m going to do some exercises lying down,\u00a0\u00a0 you can do these exercises lying in bed, and a\u00a0 couple of exercises that you can do in standing\u00a0\u00a0 as well. The first ones are lying down, and\u00a0 I\u2019m just using a mat on the ground for this\u00a0\u00a0 purpose today, but you could do these\u00a0 lying in bed. Okay, let's get started. So in bed to get into this position, if you've got\u00a0 an abdominal wound or obviously your pelvic wound,\u00a0\u00a0 rather than moving both legs up together, it's\u00a0 much safer just to slide one leg up at a time\u00a0\u00a0 into this position with your arms out beside you,\u00a0 this first exercise is called a lumbar rotation,\u00a0\u00a0 and it's just a really small roll of the\u00a0 knees. So you don't want to roll too far,\u00a0\u00a0 you don't want to feel any strain through\u00a0 your abdominal wound in particular,\u00a0\u00a0 if you had an abdominal hysterectomy, and\u00a0 you just keep it into a small rolling action\u00a0\u00a0 like this. So this is \u2013 it's also a really nice\u00a0 exercise for back discomfort too, but I'm talking\u00a0\u00a0 about moving gas today. So this is the first\u00a0 exercise and that's called lumbar rotations. The second exercise that you can do to help\u00a0 you shift some gas is pelvic tilts. Now,\u00a0\u00a0 pelvic tilts means to flatten the arch\u00a0 of the back into the bed or into the mat,\u00a0\u00a0 so I\u2019m flattening down, I'm tilting\u00a0 backwards, and I\u2019m rolling back through. Now,\u00a0\u00a0 these exercises shouldn't cause you any\u00a0 discomfort at all, they should be really\u00a0\u00a0 comfortable, as you didn\u2019t find tilting down\u00a0 and tilting back. I\u2019ll do a couple more,\u00a0\u00a0 and you can do as many as you feel comfortable\u00a0 at home, you might just do a couple at a time,\u00a0\u00a0 if that's what's going to help you. And I\u2019m going\u00a0 to do one more of those exercises, just tilting\u00a0\u00a0 back gently and rolling back through. So we've\u00a0 seen lumbar rotations, we've seen pelvic tilts. The other thing you can do in bed, and\u00a0 particularly if you're wearing your TED\u00a0\u00a0 stockings is slide one foot along \u2013 one foot\u00a0 along the ground or along the bed at a time,\u00a0\u00a0 so you're sliding \u2013 this is called a heel\u00a0 slide exercise, so you slide the leg along\u00a0\u00a0 the ground and bring it back up. I\u2019m\u00a0 having to lift over the towel there,\u00a0\u00a0 and you could slide the other leg down just\u00a0 again sliding along and then bringing it back.\u00a0\u00a0 So these are the types of exercises\u00a0 that give you some position change,\u00a0\u00a0 and changing positions is what helps you\u00a0 move the wind and the gas from your tummy,\u00a0\u00a0 and get it to passing through. And the other thing\u00a0 you can do is roll onto your side, so if you feel\u00a0\u00a0 comfortable enough, try and roll like a log. So\u00a0 rather than the legs going and the arm going,\u00a0\u00a0 you try and roll your body like a log all in one\u00a0 movement onto your side. You might use a pillow\u00a0\u00a0 underneath your tummy, if your tummy's really sore\u00a0 and swollen, and even just alternating side lying,\u00a0\u00a0 and lying on your back can also help you to shift\u00a0 some wind. You can find that if you can do some\u00a0\u00a0 gentle massage at the top of your abdomen, and I'm\u00a0 doing that in a clockwise direction from what I\u00a0\u00a0 can see from looking down, and I\u2019m coming over and\u00a0 down, up, across, over and down in that position,\u00a0\u00a0 and that's also a nice gentle way to\u00a0 help you shift gas, and move gas pain. Now, the next couple of exercises I\u2019m going to\u00a0 show you are exercises in standing. So let's go\u00a0\u00a0 do those now. These are a couple of exercises\u00a0 that you might like to try when you're out of\u00a0\u00a0 bed to help your shift gas. The first exercise is\u00a0 an exercise against a windowsill or a high bench\u00a0\u00a0 that you might have at home, and it's an exercise\u00a0 just to help move the gas. I\u2019m going to just turn\u00a0\u00a0 around slowly here, so this is a high windowsill,\u00a0 and imagine that you're leaning against it and\u00a0\u00a0 that you're just shifting your hips gently from\u00a0 side to side. So I'm just moving across side to\u00a0\u00a0 side, and you can also do some really gentle\u00a0 hula-hoop actions, so just a really gentle\u00a0\u00a0 rotation of the hips one way, and then back the\u00a0 other way. So you can see I'm just getting that\u00a0\u00a0 rolling action there, just really gently. You\u00a0 can also lean forward in that position as well,\u00a0\u00a0 and that can be a really relieving position if\u00a0 you've got gas pain. Alternatively, you could use\u00a0\u00a0 the back of a chair, and with the chair up against\u00a0 something, so it's not going to slide. And again,\u00a0\u00a0 using the back of the chair, I can do the same\u00a0 thing just rocking my hips just gently from\u00a0\u00a0 side to side, and then also rolling clockwise just\u00a0 gently, and then counterclockwise. And obviously,\u00a0\u00a0 walking is also going to be an excellent exercise\u00a0 for you to do to help you to shift gas as well. So you've seen that we've talked about a number\u00a0 of exercises there that you can use to help\u00a0\u00a0 you relieve gas pain at home. You can do the\u00a0 exercises on the ground that we talked about,\u00a0\u00a0 the lumbar rotations, the pelvic\u00a0 tilts, and the heel slides in bed,\u00a0\u00a0 or you can do some exercise in standing,\u00a0 perhaps leaning against a high bench or\u00a0\u00a0 a windowsill or against a chair and doing\u00a0 your hip rotations and your pelvic rocking.\u00a0\u00a0 So I hope those exercises help you\u00a0 with your hysterectomy recovery. I\u2019d\u00a0\u00a0 love you to subscribe. There's a subscribe\u00a0 button down below, if you'd like some more\u00a0\u00a0 pelvic floor safe exercises.

        "video_sub_title": "hi this is Molly with girl get glamorous and today I'm going to show you how to curl your hair your what your going to need is a brush to comb out your hair a clip for your extra hair I'm using a hot tools one-inch curling iron today and I'll be using a half inch flat iron for my bags you will need these or Clips what these do they help you really hold that curl if you want the curl to last longer and really stay we're going to start out by sectioning off about an inch of hair at the bottom this might be a little bit more take the extra hair using your clip you're just going to clip it up and out of the way call me out the bottom what I like to do is divide the bottom section into half and then you'll take this section and again divide it and you can just tuck it look around the front alright so starting with the back section you're going to take your curling iron and this is the most important part you are going to want to curl all of the curls away from your face this is what actually makes your face look thinner you don't want to have any curls that are going towards your face so as you can see I'm rolling the hair away from my face and I like to count for about 10 to 12 seconds before I let it go take the curl and you're going to push it back up into a crawl shape take your clip and clip it clip the bottom of your hair right next to your scalp and then you're going to take the front piece and do that again I have my curling iron set on the lowest setting it goes up to 430 degrees I have it set at 280 and I actually put the heat protectant in my hair before I started blow-drying my hair to keep it healthy if you don't do that it gets fried really really quickly so again you're going to take that curl you should back up to your head you can clip it with in with the other clip but if you have a lot of Clips I recommend just wishing each one down and again on this side of your head you are going to curl away from your face and a good trick to make sure you're curling away from your face is when you hold the curling iron out the you know the clip piece of the of the curling iron should be facing forward I like there's different ways if you want to leave the ends out you can kind of have a more natural looking curl I like my curls to be a little bit bouncy or so I put the ends right in the curling iron and again you're just going to clip it right up take down your hair divide out your next section again I try to do about an inch and a half clip the extra off and again you're going to divide your hair in half the clips will help keep your hair out of the way that you've already curled all right this time you might need to do three sections because you are getting a little bit more hair in the back of your head so again make sure that clip is facing forward pull all your hair into it I go down to the end and then curl away from your face the reason the clips are so helpful is because they're actually letting the curls cool on your head so those they'll hold their shape longer so if you're like me and like kind of disgusting and only shampoo your hair almost twice a week I think I also just called it our but if you only shampoo your hair once or twice a week this is really good because you won't have to touch up your curls and now this is where I start to do things a little bit differently I'm going to take this part of the hair and move it forward but then all of the hair that's left for the back of my hand I'm actually I'm going to curl that a different way and I'll show you I do that because they just don't like when you see you know the curls coming together in the back of your head I want to you know just see volume and I don't want to see that line when you're curling your hair boom again and this time I just go take all the curls take the hair in it and I just curl it straight down and I'll take that out you're going to clip this one a little bit differently to take that curl back up and then you're going to take your clip you're going to clip the bottom of the curl right into your head so that you get that curl just held up in the direction you just curled it and you're going to take the piece that you curled and your bags take a little piece of that and start to Flatiron those those hairs together that way you don't have a line you know between the straightened bags and the curls you're going to take your flat iron and gently push the hair on you're a little bit just it's not just a lot stick straight and you'll leave those bags and your front pieces out to cool and then you'll feel your hair when it starts to kind of cool down it takes about all right I'm ready to take the clip out the hair is totally cooled now we'll do is I'll start on the bottom all right then I like to just comb the top you can't see the line between any of the curl all right there you",

        "video_title": "Disposable Mascara Wands Eyelash Brushes Wands Applicators Makeup Tutorial by New8Beauty.com",
        "video_sub_title": "hi this is Lauren and today I'm going to be reviewing fees this set of 50 disposable mascara wands from new 8 beauty and it also comes with this application guard so these mascara wands are actually really great so disposable mascara wands are mainly used for makeup artists who do not want to contaminate their product and they will reuse or so they don't have to reuse the same mascara wand inside of the tube here but they can be used for a lot of different things they can be used for people who are concerned with hygiene or don't like the wand in their current mascara bottle or maybe you want to go try out some mascaras at the store you can bring your own disposable wands because they might not always have them available or you might be concerned with the hygiene of the ones that they have there so there are a lot of different reasons to get disposable mascara wands and these ones are especially great because of the way that they bend here so they have kind of a metal like pliable metal center here that you can kind of just bend any shape that you want so you can bend it to basically the shape of your eye and kind of give that perfect angle wherever it may be so if I bent it like this into a curve here I could really get all of my eyelashes in one swoop if I wanted to so I'm going to go ahead and put it a nice curve for the shape of my eye so it will go well on the bottom on top of my eye and then I'm going to simply dip it inside of my mascara tube if you bend it too much it might be a little bit hard to actually get the mascara on it or get it in the bottle so just be aware of that so I'm going to evenly coat it with mascara and then I'm going to use this really cool operator here this basically is just so you don't ruin your face makeup or your eyeshadow I know a lot of people will put get mascara on their nose when they're putting on mascara or get it on their I shadow that they've just done and it will pretty much ruin your eyeshadow so I think that this is a really great invention and I'm going to show you how to use this as well so for your top lashes you're actually going to just sort of put it on top like right next to your lid there and then I'm going to take my mascara and kind of just brush it up against the applicator or the application guard this also really helps you get a really great coating on your eyelashes because you have something to brush it against you can kind of wiggle it back and forth making sure that every single eyelash is getting a really great coat of mascara and the amount of bristles on this brush um really help you get a great coating of mascara on each of your lashes so that contributes to it as well on the other side of this application guard is also a little comb here that comes in to sort of different sizes one of them is a little bit more spread apart with thicker bristles and the other one is a little bit thinner and this is really great because if you get any clumps in your mascara all you can kind of just comb through them either with the little thinner brush here which might be better for coming out clumps or the thicker brush might just be good for simply fanning out your lashes a little bit more so that's another really great use for little application guard here so then you're going to do your bottom lashes you're going to put this under here and sort of just do the same thing I can kind of touch it up once I feel a little bit more confident and because it's in the shape of my eye it's it's much easier and much quicker to do my mascara because a lot of times when you just have that straight sort of mascara wand you have to go in like this and kind of go do your individual lashes but because it's in the shape of my eye already I can kind of just do a couple strokes and it's got all the ones in here as well as all the ones on the outside there and same with my upper lashes so I think the fact that you can bend these is extremely helpful in applying mascara quickly and also flawlessly so as you can see there's the difference there and my eyelash is on the side look a lot fuller because I was able to really put it against the eyelash guard and get a full coating on my each of one of my eyelashes making them look a lot thicker so you can get both of these products in the same package they come in this little package like this with a little ziplock here it's a really cute little carrying case that comes with it and you can buy these products on nu8 Beauty comm that's any W the number-8 Beauty be EA uty calm and again I would highly recommend these mascara wands they're great for makeup artists great for you know hygiene conscious people or anything like that or even if you just want to change out your mascara wand try something new because sometimes you can get what you'd think would be a really bad mascara if you try it with a different wand it might work a lot better than you originally thought so don't throw away mascara that you might not like or something like that because it might just be the wand so you can try buying a new wand and seeing if the application of the mascara really makes difference so I hope you learned something from this video and thank you so much for watching again check them out on new AP Unicom bye",

        "video_title": "Do this exercise to fix Hunchback Posture and forward head posture",
        "video_sub_title": "- Got hunchback and forward head posture? Let's look at a simple exercise to help you fix it. (upbeat music) I'm Matt Hsu from Upright Health where we help you move beyond your limitations so you can live with confidence. Be sure to scroll down to the description box for helpful links to help you with your posture. And while you're down there, do not forget to subscribe so you don't miss out on future videos. If you have hunchback posture, you probably also have forward head posture to go with it. The curvature of your upper back influences the way your head and neck sit. So you definitely want to be dealing with exercises that help you straighten out the upper back and also reposition the head and neck over the spine. Now, in this video, I'm gonna show you a simple exercise that you can do anywhere with no equipment to help you reposition your head and neck and train those muscles to stabilize that better position. And if you watch to the end, I'm gonna show you a way to progress the exercise to strengthen your neck muscles even more. And all it requires is an inexpensive piece of equipment that you can fit in your pocket. To do this exercise, you're gonna take your hands and interlace your fingers. You're gonna put your head and neck in as neutral position as you can. And it may feel a little awkward because you're used to being here. So you're just gonna try to tuck your chin, keep your eyes on the horizon and pull your head and neck back a little bit. Then you're gonna take your hands and put your interlaced fingers together behind your head. So I've got my hands like this, right here, locked behind my head. And then I'm just gonna pull back into my hands. My hands are gonna provide a resistance point. So I'm not allowing my head and neck to move. I'm contracting the muscles around my neck, but I'm not actually moving anywhere. And then I can relax it. So I'm counting to about three. When you first start, you don't need to go hard. You just wanna feel like you're pushing back this way. So it's similar to the chin tuck that you may have seen in other videos, but we're adding resistance to this to make these muscles work. So the hands create a blocking force and then we're just pushing back into the hands. Now, as you get better at feeling these muscles working, you can hold the contractions for longer than three. Just adjust based on what you can handle. Probably like a count of 10 is probably more than enough. And then you can go ahead and relax. Now, as you get better and better at controlling these different positions, you're gonna be able to get further and further back into that really stacked, aligned position. And that's your goal. So you just wanna keep working towards getting to that aligned position over time and not force it and like try to get as far back as you can. You just wanna gradually go in stages. If you're here this week, maybe next week, you'll be back just a little bit further. And maybe the week after that, you'll be back even further. I generally have my clients use this exercise for two to three sets of five to 10. And as you get more and more comfortable with it, you can keep doing it throughout the day to help counteract the effect of sitting at the computer or looking at your smartphone or playing video games or whatever it is you're doing. One thing you wanna watch out for during this exercise is compensation in the muscles of your low back. So sometimes people will take their hands, put them behind their head and then pull their head back. And while they're doing that, the low back muscles are also creating extension down here. So they're getting interior tilt. They're getting into these lower doses because they're using these muscles and pairing that with activity here. So it's hard sometimes to get the coordination to separate neck muscles in extension and lower back muscles in extension. So to trick your muscles to separate their functions, you're going to take your feet and just separate them out so you have a wider stance or a longer stance anyway. So you have one foot forward, one foot back, and then you just keep your abs engaged and then pull your head and neck back into your hands. That way your pelvis is already put in a more neutral locked position, so your low back is not gonna be able to pull as much and your abs can help keep that pelvis stabilized as you keep that contraction going. If you wanna get even more stable in your head and neck position, then you can also change the directions of the contractions you're using. So as I've shown you already, we're doing this posteriorly directed contraction. We're just trying to bring the head and neck back. Once you've started to get your head and neck into a pretty neutral position, you can then start using contractions to the side. So you can put your hands on the side of your head and then work on shifting your head into the hand, again, not actually letting it get anywhere. So you're building control in this neutral position shifting laterally. So then you start using muscles along the side of your neck. You can do it to the right side. And I'm gonna push that way. The same kind of rules apply. I'm just building control here. Now over time as I get better and better at building control, I can maybe experiment with building control in positions that aren't neutral and natural because sometimes, I need to turn my head and twist my head and look around and I want my neck to be strong enough to handle that when I need to do that. So first we wanna start with getting head and neck in neutral, strengthening those positions, and then we can start playing with the other positions once your head and neck is in neutral and you can start going sideways, you can go diagonally back, diagonally back, sideways. I can even go forward if I want to, just getting the muscles all around the neck used to firing in different directions with the head and neck in a neutral position. For all these different directions, the same rules for sets and reps apply. You've got to listen to your body and just adjust based on how it feels. But starting off with two to three reps of five to 10 for three-second contractions and gradually building up should work out pretty well for most people. But again, pay attention, see what your body says, see how response and adjust accordingly. If you can handle more, go for it. Just gradually increase how many times you're doing it as long as you feel like it is helping you. Now, you have a quick and easy antidote to your hunchback posture and forward head posture that you can use throughout the day. If you have forward head posture or a hunchback posture, you probably already saw this head and neck retraction exercises, this chin tuck exercise that everybody talks about for trying to correct forward head posture. Now maybe you saw it in a chiropractor's office or a PT or a trainer showed it to you, or maybe you read about it in a comic book or something about forward head posture. But in any case, if you've tried it, it was probably kind of frustrating because you noticed that like, yeah, I can do this, but then it requires so much mental effort throughout the day. This doesn't really seem to stick and it's not really holding. So how is this exercise with the hands behind our head, any different? The chin tuck exercise isn't bad. It's just that it's not good enough to accomplish what most people are looking for. It's really good to just help you reestablish that control and get that coordination of these muscles so that you know what direction you're trying to go. But because there's no resistance to the motion, those muscles don't really get much stronger than just being able to do this when you ask for it. So imagine, for example, if I wanted to strengthen my arm muscle here, my biceps, and I just started doing bicep curls like this. And I just took my hand through this range of motion and I kept bending the elbow, extending the elbow. I wouldn't really build much muscle mass and muscle strength because I'm not fighting against resistance. I'm just using body weight. That's the same thing here. I'm just positioning my head, but that's not really challenging those muscles to get stronger. In order to get the arm to get stronger, this bicep muscle has to be fighting at some kind of resistance so that it realizes that, hey, I need to get better at this and get much stronger at this because for some reason, somebody keeps applying resistance to me. So that's why we need to have something behind our head and neck so that we can push into it and generate force with the muscles of the back of the neck. Now that you understand the implant resistance in building strength in muscles, let's make the exercise a little bit more challenging. So we can grab a training band, some sort of a rubber band, or one of those PT elastic bands. I'm using a pull-up band. I'll leave a link in the description. And you can put it just behind your head like this. So you just have it grasped in your hands, put the band behind your head, and then you're just pulling forward and you're not letting your head get slingshoted forward. So you have the band behind your head, you're pulling forward and then your head and neck is pulling back. So we've got resistance now. We have this force that's actually actively trying to pull your head forward and you are fighting with that. Now you can adjust the resistance by choking up or choking down on the band. So if I go wider grip, the band isn't pulling quite as hard. So I can make sure that my head and neck is capable of handling whatever level of resistance that the band is providing. As I want it to get harder and harder, I can get even narrower. The band starts pulling harder and I got really worked to get there. Now, I wouldn't suggest trying to do a maximum effort thing with the band here. You wanna just use a tolerable, manageable amount of resistance here and just pull into it. I actually prefer to have a little bit more distance so that the band has more stretch and more available stretching distance so that it doesn't feel like I max out the bands elasticity. So if I go super narrow, it's almost like I'm gonna be running into a wall. Of course it depends on you, if you're like an NFL linebacker and you're doing stuff to really build up your neck a ton, you do what you gotta do. But if you're just starting out with this, go easy on yourself, just get yourself a little bit of resistance here. And then out you go. You can of course, modify this as you wish. You could go sideways, like so. You could go diagonally, like so. You could wrap this around your head and then you've got yourself a really cheap, easy Halloween costume. All right, guys, that's gonna do it for this video. I hope you found it useful and educational. Be sure to scroll down to the description box for helpful links to help you with your posture.

reusable medication bottle and it's used to clean the site where we're going to give the injection this is the medication bottle it's really usable and so we're not going to be using all of the fluid that's inside it but we're going to be drawing up a set amount from it this is the syringe this is a one-nil syringe but they come in different sizes and really the size that you're going to be using is dependent upon the volume that is in the injection next we've got the green needle we use this needle to draw up the medication out of the bottle it looks huge but don't panic we're not going to be using it to give the injection we use a large needle at this stage just to make the drawing up of the fluid from the bottle easy this is the yellow needle and this is the needle which we're going to be using for the injection you can see that it's much shorter it's much finer and this makes the injection process much more comfortable lastly we've got the sharks box we use this to dispose of the used needles and syringe and also to get rid of the empty medication bottles as I'm using a hormonal medication this sharps box has a purple lid but depending upon the type of medication your sharks box may have a yellow or an orange lid now that we've got everything ready we can move on to drawing up the injection before opening any of the packets wash your hands thoroughly to make sure they are clean now open the syringe packet but keep the syringe within the packet as we will not be using it quite yet then pull back and fully depress the syringe plunger this is to make sure it is not stiff and his free movement when we do come to use it open the packets for the needles but don't take them out just now until we need them in a little bit tear open the alcohol swab carefully along one edge so you don't tear the swab inside and take it out of the packet use the swab to clean the top of the medicine bottle put the swap to one side once this is done and let the top of the bottle air dry we are going to be using the larger green needle first to draw up the medication so take the syringe out of its packaging and gently push it into the opening of the green needle you may want to rotate it a little to make sure it is firmly fixed into position remove the needle cover carefully this can sometimes be a little difficult so gently wiggle it back and forth making sure it doesn't spring out and in G you take the medication bottle and hold it upside down at a slight angle insert the needle carefully through the gray self-sealing opening make sure the tip of the needle is in the liquid and pull back on the plunger drawing the liquid up into the syringe at this stage you may find you get some air in the syringe this is not a problem although you do want to get rid of it to do this gently flick the syringe to get the air bubble to the top and push the air back into the bottle you may need to repeat this a few times to make sure all the air is out continue to draw out the liquid until you get the amount you need in this video we're drawing out point five mils once you have the amount you'll require and there are no air bubbles in the syringe remove the needle from the bottle there will be some liquid in the needle itself so gently pull that back into the syringe we now want to dispose of the green needle and the safest way to do this is by using the groove in the lid of the sharps box like so never resheath a needle in the cover it came in this is a surefire way of risking injury by accidentally stabbing yourself with the needle now we attach the smaller yellow needle in the same way as the green ready for the injection gently remove the cover from the needle and you now need to push the small amount of air in the top of the syringe out do this slowly until you see a little drop of the medication come out at the top of the needle so now we are ready to give the injection there are various different places you can give a subcutaneous injection and the choice is up to you the most popular sites for self injection of the tummy area and this is a semicircle about one centimeter out from the belly that goes from either side of the belly button and under it or you can choose the upper legs anywhere there is a little bit of underlying fact if these are not appropriate for you there are other sites you can use but you should discuss their use with the doctor or nurse we are going to be injecting into the upper leg in this video and in case you are wondering the marks already on the leg of moles not previous injections the subcutaneous injections shouldn't leave a lasting mark expose the area and choose the site where you're going to be doing the injection clean the area where you're going to be doing the injection with the alcohol swab and let it air dry if you were using the leg the upper outer part is often most comfortable if you're having regular injections it is best to rotate the sites so use one leg one day and the other leg for next when you are ready to give the injection take the needle in your dominant hand and with your other hand squeeze together the skin and fat hold the syringe roughly 90 degrees to the skin and push the needle firmly into the tissue the needle is short so don't worry that it is going too deep once the needle is in try not to move it around as this is what can cause discomfort gently push the plunger down injecting all of the fluid into the leg once all the fluid has been injected pull the needle straight out and take a piece of cotton wool or an alcohol swab and put some pressure over the injection site it can be perfectly normal for a bit of the fluid to come to the skin surface or a little bit of blood continue to put pressure on the site until any light bleeding has stopped or alternatively you can put a plaster on the area you now that you've done the injection you need to dispose of the syringe and needle do not try to resheath the needle before doing this they go straight into the sharps box still attached to each other this concludes the video on how to give a subcutaneous injection thank you for watching this video if you found it useful please like it as it encourages us to make more videos and if you think it might help someone else why not share it goodbye and good luck",

        "video_title": "ZPacks Cuben Fiber Backpack Cover",
        "video_sub_title": "hey everybody this is Chad from six blog I'm Stig today I'd like to talk to everybody about the Z packs cuben fiber rain cover now to start off with I will go ahead and say that I do understand that a rain cover is not for everybody just by doing some research and stuff on the internet you'll find tons of people that refuse to carry a rain cover you'll find people that refuse to leave without a rain cover some people like to use pack liners some people like to use both so I do understand it's a personal preference for me in my experience I found that I'd rather have a rain cover on my pack just simply to help shed water and stuff especially in the heavier rains as soon as your paint gets wet sort of soaking up that water in your pack can become heavy depending on what your pack is made out of it take a considerable amount of time to try out now one reason I did get this cuben fiber rain cover is because I'm kind of on a place to kind of lighten the loads but still carry stuff that works for me the pack that I'm gonna be using on at the time that I've got here's the ula circuit I just got that a couple of weeks ago well about two months ago maybe now but anyway so when I did my research I wanted to find a rain cover that would fit my eye circuit so what I found out is I came across Joe's website see packs he sells these cuben fiber range covers now as an alternative he does sell stealing nylon ring covers the sealing nylon is made out of 1.3 ounce seal and the Cuban fiber is made out of point 51 ounce cuben fiber he does recommend on it his page that if you're going to be doing a lot of bushwhackin or off-trail hiking it might be a wiser idea though he can get the seal nylon just because it's a little more durable than the Cuban fiber but often stuff for the Cuban fibers simply because most of the trails I hike on just think trails like the Appalachian Trail that's the kind of trails and I'm typically on and if I do have to get off the trail it's not going to be for a whole lot another reason I chose to go with Cuban fiber is because most of the time a rain cover is left inside my pack rather than on my pack so I was looking for something that was lightweight that I wouldn't have to be lugging around they such as my last rain cover with five ounces that's what I carried for my last backpack so I was looking for something a lot smaller and a lot lighter so what I have here is this is the large size cuben fiber rain pat cover now he does sell these and 3 sizes he says it in a small which will fit see it fits tank size up to 2,000 cubic inches a large which fits I mean a medium which will fit up to 2,000 to 3,500 cubic inches and then the large which is 3,500 250 500 cubic inches I like to say I went with a large for my circuit I think I might I could have got away with a medium just simply because I may not always have the pant completely feel like it is right now but I went ahead and went with a large just in case and also the physical weight differences now these rain covers are offered in a couple of different colors this is a leaf green and I believe you may have a white or clear or something I'm not really sure exactly what the hell but you can pick and choose those on the sites now as far as weights I did say this is the large and this one weighs one point two ounces if you wanted to go with the medium it's going to weigh one point one ounce and if you went with a small it will weigh point nine ounce so as you can see it's not a real big change in weight as you go up to size so that's another reason I opted to go for the large because it was only 0.1 ounce difference now on the ceiling Islands just imagine the seal nine lines are going to be they're going to be a little less expensive but they're going to be double the weight now when you're looking at it a large and the sealing I long weighs 2.6 ounces there's still not a lot of weight but again like I said I was going through the lightest weight so anyway I just kind of want to show you this and just a few other things the the weight does include the stuff sank and each one comes with its own stuff sack the stuff sack is made of the same material and it's just got a little cord lock in it and uses a little cord lock and a little strange cinch talk since it shut and when I set this on my scales and would not even register a reading in grams that's how light this thing is I bet these leaves are probably about the same weight I mean this thing is super super light so anyway so this is the rain cover just to kind of show you how big it is Lorne's it here and spread it out this is the large you see it's plenty big this thing is 100% rain or waterproof the reason I can say that or the reason the science is that is because it doesn't have any seams anywhere on it it's a solid piece of Cuban fiber so there's no scenes for water to get in the only scene is actually the hem that's sewn around the back edge where the elastic cord is to cinch it tight now one thing that I did ask Jo to do what I found out in another with my the rain cover one day during a real heavy storm a bunch of water had gotten inside the rain cover and it was all pulled in the bottom of my pack so what I asked you to do is I asked him to put a just a little drain hole on the bottom of this one I do believe a lot of Maine or mainstream covers and stuff even have these in them but as you can see if I can show you all he did was he just simply put that little grommet in the bottom of it didn't hardly add to anything to the weight as far as I can tell I mean it's like say us one point two ounces on my scales a couple other features about it he does have these two straps these straps can be clipped together up underneath your shoulder straps or through your haul loop that way it will help hold the pack or the rain cover in place and the wind can't come by and blow it off and then of course he uses this 1/16 inch of elastic bungee cord and then another small toggle and that's what you use to put it around the pack as far as durability this thing it does it's real lightweight and I do question it if I was to go off trail but as far as just regular plain old use I have no worries about using this I'm really happy with it the one thing I might be a little concerned with is when I put it on and I'm cinching it down I might be afraid that I might actually pull this and break this elastic cord that's about the only thing that I really have any kind of concerns or worries about as far as the straps I'm actually considering cutting those off because I don't believe I'll ever use them and it probably wouldn't save much but considering the weight of the material and everything I'm gonna say I would lose about 2/10 3/10 7 ounce for sure just by cutting these straps off because these buckles is where a lot of the weight does actually come into play on this I don't get me around I don't cut my toothbrush handle off I'm not that involved I'm just saying it's something that's probably I don't use and I just to kind of show you I'm on my pack here now I've got my pack I just got a pillow and stuff in it just fill it up so it'll be kind of big to put that on like I said you can use these buckles you can or these straps you can run them up under there I don't do that just get it all on there just like any other backpack cover pull that up cinch that down make sure it's covered all the way around and that's it this is the Z packs point 51 per hour point 51 ounces per square yard rain cover and LeafGreen I pay $49 for it you",

        "video_title": "How to Treat Candida in 6 Steps | Dr. Josh Axe",
        "video_sub_title": "Hey, guys. Dr. Axe here, doctor of functional medicine and founder of DrAxe.com. Today I'm going to share with you the exact diet, treatment and supplements you need to take the clear Candida from your body. And this is what I really consider to be my Six-Step Candida Cure Diet Protocol. And you're going to see amazing results with this protocol. And let me say this first, what is Candida? Candida is the overgrowth of yeast and bad bacteria in your body and it can cause some major symptoms that you want to get rid of. And so some of the symptoms of Candida can include any type of fatigue issue. If you struggle with chronic fatigue or adrenal fatigue, those can be related to Candida. Any type of leaky gut issue. Leaky gut is intestinal permeability, where proteins like gluten can leak through your gut and cause inflammation of your body. So if you have food sensitivities or if you have digestive issues like gas and bloating, also if you have any problem related to the thyroid, those can be warning signs you have Candida. Also if you get yeast in your body. If you notice, let's say, yeast or whiteness on your tongue or if you ever get chronic yeast infections or coming down with the cold and flu often, those can be warning signs that you have Candida. And, of course, also with Candida any sort of other digestive issues, like irritable bowel syndrome or chronic diarrhea or constipation or even acid reflux, those are warning signs that you might have Candida. And last but not least, is a sluggish metabolism. If you aren't losing weight and burning fat like you know you should be, those are warning signs you could have Candida, along with actually even bad breath and lack of detoxification. Those are some major warning signs. So here are the six things you need to do to eliminate Candida fast. Number one, you need to stop consuming so much sugar. Now, I know that's obvious. That's something that I think most of us realize is that sugar feeds yeast in your body. But again, you have got to get rid of processed sugar, fruit juices, any sort of added sugar to any sort of product sweetener. Even most packaged products and fast foods are also high in sugar. Even things like pasta sauces and crackers, you'd be surprised, but sugar is added to almost everything. So again, eliminate especially the processed sugar out of your diet. As a replacement, I recommend using a little bit of Stevia, which is a no-calorie natural sweetener and then about one to three teaspoons a day of manuka honey. Okay? Those are the sweeteners you should be using if you have Candida. Number two. You need to eliminate grains from your diet. Why? Because grains turn into sugar and they also tend to be more inflammatory. And so again, getting those grains out of your diet, especially wheat products and gluten-containing grains, that's step number two. Instead, do a lot more vegetables and maybe some starchy carbs. Number three thing you have to do to clear Candida from you system, is support your spleen. Now, this is cutting-edge information that a lot of people don't realize. And this is a practice in Ancient China that is often used by acupuncturists today. But they have found that the number one cause of Candida is a weakened spleen. And so if you have spleen issues, and spleen is responsible for digestion of the body, producing red blood cells in your system. And so the spleen is a very important organ. In order to support the spleen, there are a couple things you need to do. But really the spleen is supported by starchy foods, especially squash, things like sweet potatoes, butternut squash, and also even doing certain types of beans like lentils and mung beans. So again, getting some of those good starchy carbs. And that's really where your sweetness should come from. A little bit of butternut squash, acorn squash, foods like that that has that mild sweetness. That's the only sweet you should be really getting in your diet. Again, with no processed sugar and, again, very low amount of fruit typically when you have that, as well. But again, you want to support the spleen. Another great way to support the spleen is by drinking barley tea. You can buy roast barley tea on Amazon.com. And barley tea is the number one herb really that helps support the spleen as well doing that as a tea. The next thing you want to do, number four, is support the liver. The liver is crucial and supporting the liver in terms of detoxification for getting rid of Candida in your body. And again, your liver is responsible for detoxification. So for that reason you really want to support that area. And so really the foods that support the liver are sour foods. And so doing a lot of probiotic-rich foods and sour foods, things like 24-29 hour fermented kefir, also fermented vegetables, like sauerkraut and kimchi, and apple cider vinegar. But getting those sour foods are great for supporting the liver and getting rid of Candida. Number five thing you've got to do is you've got to support your intestines, both your small and large intestine. And that really comes down to bitter foods, foods that are bitter in nature, things like kale and arugula are more bitter. Cinnamon and ginger and certain spices like turmeric are more bitter in nature. But doing bitter foods and bitter herbs, those are very supportive of the digestive track. Romaine lettuce is another one. So again, I would really suggest that you also get some of those bitter foods in your diet. And last but not least, you've got to take a probiotic supplement. One of the keys to overcoming Candida is eliminating and really starving off the sugar and yeast in your body by eliminating sugar and grades. And then at the same time as those bacteria or those yeast die off, loading up on good bacteria. So again, making sure you're getting some of those good quality probiotics in your diet. I'd recommend typically taking a double or triple dose of probiotics while you're doing a Candida cleanse or while you're doing this Candida protocol for at least 30 to probably 90 days of following this program. And the last sort of bonus tip I want to give here is a lot of times people tend to go and get antifungals, whether it be a medication or even supplements to eliminate Candida. And I want to say this, that really doesn't take care of the main cause of Candida. Typically when you have Candida, the thing you want to do is follow those dietary protocols and support the organs I talked about in your spleen, your liver and especially your small intestine. But again, in certain cases, for taking for about a 10 to 14 day period you can take natural antifungals like oil of oregano, grape seed extract, garlic, other essential oils as well can work. So you want to do those, but don't take those more than 10 to 14 days and make sure you're following the diet with that. If you can follow those tips, I guarantee you're going to see great results in eliminating Candida from your body. One more last tip. Don't consume a lot of cold foods. Cold foods actually tend to be hard on the spleen and can cause Candida to grow in your system. You actually want to be doing a lot of warm foods like bone broth soup, which is a great thing for getting rid of Candida as well.

        "video_sub_title": "hello there do you have dry hair and use demi-permanent colors to dye your hair i love the vibrant colors but not how dry my ends appear so i came up with an idea by giving my hair a treatment with olive oil i'm not quite sure if it would drastically fade out my die so let's line up together okay so first things first you'll need a hair tinting brush four tablespoons of virgin olive oil a hair clip in a bowl for the treatment process grab a plastic bag to use at the end of this application heat up the bowl of oil for 20 seconds or until the oil is very warm appearing very runny in nature start off by sectioning your hair from the center then sectioning off each chunk of hair going along that line lightly dip the brush into the oil making sure to grab just enough to coat the hair a few times before going back this way you can minimize excess oil dripping onto your work counter and clothing when applying olive oil avoid coating it near the roots personally my hair tends to get greasy easily so doing this will prevent it from becoming heavy make sure to cover the ends of each strand as that is where your hair will be moisturizing the most now repeat the same process to the other half of the section hair after the entire top section of your hair is conditioned using your hair clip flip the coated hair back and out of your face then proceed to section off the rest of the lower half of the hair in the same manner i will leave things off here as i'm sure you have a good idea how it is now done with your entire head of hair all coated in olive oil take the plastic bag and cover your hair with it to prevent any oil from leaking out leave the treatment in for two hours then rinse your hair out a bit with shampoo and warm water only condition near the skull the results were that the olive oil did not cause my hair color to fade drastically but warm water did cause for the dye to bleed a little bit i allowed for my hair to dry naturally and it became much softer being able to run my fingers through it risk being gone down to a minimum for those of you who have demi-permanent hair colors you may now be able to condition your hair to your heart's content if you're wondering why my makeup changed drastically this was actually filmed the next day and the makeup is part of another tutorial which will be posted on my new channel which i will link you down below thank you so much for watching and if you like this video feel free to share it with friends also subscribe to my channel to stay in touch with my latest video and blog posts if you have any questions or comments leave them in the box below until then see ya",

        "video_sub_title": "When your head is pounding like a jackhammer, your nose is running like Niagara Falls and even your favorite foods start to taste like cardboard, you\u2019d do almost anything to get rid of your cold. Before you resort to pouring yourself a tall glass of bleach to get rid of your symptoms, there are some better (clear throat) non-crazy ways to cure your cold. 1. Get Some Sleep. The body can do miraculous things when we let it rest. We often catch a cold when we\u2019re feeling run down, or even exhausted. Sometimes, just getting some extra rest is all you need to help the immune system do its dirty work or cleaning our nasty viruses and foreign bacteria from the body. Just one day of extra rest can boost the immune system. 2. Hydrate. Water taken generously even when you are not ill helps the body to flush toxins out, and it is even more important to stay hydrated when you are sick. If you add some lemon and honey to your water and warm it, this can also help to loosen phlegm and reduce congestion. 3. Rely on nature\u2019s herbal helpers like ginger, garlic, oregano oil, astragalus root, olive leaf and calendula. These are natural anti-virals which support the body as adaptogens. Add some turmeric and organic coconut oil \u2013 natural antibacterials to your diet \u2013 and your cold hasn\u2019t got a chance. Follow these simple cold remedies and you won\u2019t need to flush your nose and throat like a cleaning lady wielding a toilet brush and caustic chemical cleaners. No desperate acts required!

        "video_sub_title": "hey everybody its Bunny and it is that time of the week again when we ask ourselves does this thing really work this week I'm testing out an empty box this is the I think this is Conair I don't know instyler is that the brand you guys have been requesting this for I feel a long long time I've seen it in a ton of comments so this is the InStyler rotating wet-to-dry curling curling apparatus I don't know it's supposed to be able to straighten curl add volume and shine while it dries so it says you're supposed to be able to style your hair five times faster with less damage doesn't that sound so excite right off the bat I have a question for you guys I need a little participation a lot of people use it on dry hair so go ahead and thumbs up this video and let me know if you would like me to test this device out on dry hair I'm doing it on damp hair this time I did just wash my hair and I'm letting it towel dry you're supposed to be able to straighten it or curl it obviously you can't do both at the same time so I'm gonna try and do like a section of hair trying to do both techniques and I already read the instruction manual and I hear that when you use it on wet or damp hair you're gonna hear a crackling sound does that scare anybody else I don't know that horrifies me so all day I've been trying to prepare myself for hair crackling this is what this thing looks like it's kind of weird isn't it it's like blue silver black white so it has these little cone like bristles which I'm not gonna lie kind of scare me a little bit this is the heat barrel it almost looks like it's got like a ceramic plate or something on the inside of this side I don't know I installed this black thing myself it's supposed to be a heat guard and they say if you are a beginning user that it's a good idea to have the heat guard on here so you don't burn yourself I think that they say that this thing does heat up to 430 degrees so that's super hot there are three heat settings but I think that that is for when you use it on the dry like if your hair is dry because right on the bottom it has the little sticker and it says if you're using it with wet or damp hair that you're supposed to use it on the high heat setting so that's what I'm gonna do cuz I'm following instructions let's get this party started huh uh I didn't even know I was just goofing off looking oh this has robotic power oh my god Sao Paulo ah like I said my hair is just damp so I'm just going to take a small section and make sure that there are no tangles and it also says in the instructions that you're supposed to do it very slowly they say that if you do it too fast you might have to do like two passes to get it to straighten Wow that's pretty freakin magical I honestly didn't really hear any crackling until it got to the very edge of the hair but I definitely do think that this is straight normally my hair is a little bit wavy you're not really going to be able to tell I don't think too much when it's wet but that is basically the texture of my hair I'm gonna do another section I'm actually vastly completely impressed with this device and my hair is totally dry so I don't know it doesn't feel like burnt or crispy or disgusting or damaged in any way I'm gonna comb through and try another section this is the most impressed I've ever been with like a hair does this thing really work device this is pretty freakin sweet I do have to say I was really honestly doubtful I thought it would be like horrifying and I would hear a bunch of like crackling air popping sounds but I don't so impressed so except I have the power I'm a spinny Headey brush to buy food like you do see a little bit of I guess like C or something does that make any sense coming out there like a fiend that would be disturbing but I really don't see me doing any damage and keep your heat crackling probably not all right we are just having a hootenanny look at that look at that perfectly straightened hair I actually don't want to stop even though I'm just doing a demonstration right now I actually want to keep going it's a lot of fun and it's really easy to use we're gonna try a blonde piece now so y'all can see what that looks like because I feel like sometimes it's hard for you guys to see what's going on with my black hair straightening straightening Ellen magic summit oh and your little back one now maybe set the blonde sections of my hair just actually more damage I don't know I hear a little bit more crackling but it doesn't look like it's probably my hair or anything I don't know I don't I don't look at that perfectly straightened hair look like a pretty-pretty straightened hair princess I have to say that my expectations are incredibly exceeded I did not think that this would work this goodly I'm so impressed I took the heat guard off now though because we're gonna try and curl a couple pieces on this side because I don't think you're supposed to like wrap the hair around the barrel if that makes any sense and then like let it spin in place so we shall see I didn't think I could do that with the heat guard though how would you do that I don't know I'm not gonna track now I don't think that this could possibly make a ringlet curl which is the kind of curl that I normally like but we'll see if I can get it to curl at all this is actually kind of mind-boggling as to how I would wrap this I guess like this uh okay wrapping the hair and I guess I'm supposed to just go like that sweet look happy you don't know run it up I don't have let me go I'm like this though I didn't see how many wearing instructions I probably got enough sod ah nope not impressed with that I'm going to give it one more go and try a little bit smaller of a section of hair so tangle-free is the way to be today at least I'm going to try and wrap it around again as they say in the instructions so here I am wrapping wrapping and closing it to let it do its magic hi look at the 25 okay da-da-da-da-da-da-da oh okay that did a little bit better so maybe I didn't leave it on long enough the first time I don't think it would really time save any at all to do the curling with this device but I mean hey it's something that potentially you could do and this is kind of the curl that I expected you know like a really really loose barrel curl because the barrel is pretty thick I don't know what would y'all say is that like a two inch barrel one and a half inch barrel on a whole I have to say I'm extremely impressed with this device it is however $100 I found mine at Target this is the most impressed that I've ever been with like and as seen on tv hair device and I do see how that could be a huge time-saver for like getting ready for school or work in the morning like if you've just taken a shower and you still want to straighten your hair so I don't know if like that heat and what hair thing doesn't bother you I mean I don't know I was very disturbed by the crackling warning I didn't hear any crackling I did see a little like smoke or steam rising but hey it's damp hair I don't know I think you're okay if you just do it on damp hair then again I'm not a professional I'm just a regular old person trying this stuff out if you were curious about does this thing really work or not I definitely have to say it totally works so don't forget to leave me a comment down below and like this video if you would like to see me do it on dry hair maybe it adds more volume when your hair is dry so let me know if that is something you would like to see I hope

        "video_title": "Shock - diagnosis and treatment | Circulatory System and Disease | NCLEX-RN | Khan Academy",
        "video_sub_title": "- In order to diagnose and treat shock what do you have to do, like how do you go about diagnosing and discovering shock, figuring out what type of shock it is and utilizing the proper treatment for that type of shock. Well, there's really three ways that I like to break it down. So, first of all, what's going on in shock? Well, we have severely decreased tissue profusion. And what that means is decreased oxygenation to the different cells of the body. And, as we know, decreased oxygenation means decreased ability to create energy. And, without energy cells can become defunct or die. So, that just of course highlights why diagnosing shock is so important. So, I'm going to break it down into three steps, but let's think about this. First of all, shock is decreased tissue profusion and so we need to focus on the delivery of oxygen. Well, how does the body deliver oxygen? Well, the heart pumps blood throughout the body to the tissues. And so here's an oversimplified version of how the cardiovascular system works. Blood is pumped from the heart to the tissues and blood returns to the heart. And this is the cycle of oxygen delivery. So, looking at this, the first thing I think is what can get this to fail? Well, first of all, we can mess with the pump, right? Is there something wrong with the pump? Is the heart not working? Also, along those same lines, the entire cardiovascular system. Is there something wrong with the pipes, are the blood vessels not performing their task of carrying oxygen to the tissues and back to the heart? So, really the first way to measure that, the first way to look at that, is to look at blood pressure. And that's tied directly to both the pipes and the pump. Blood pressure, the equation for blood pressure is cardiac output times systemic vascular resistance. So, that's both the heart, the pump, and the vascular system, the pipes. And this is usually the way that practitioners are alerted that patients might be experiencing shock of some sort. Now, how else can we analyze the pump? Now, heart cells have an enzyme called troponin. So, when these heart cells are damaged, they release troponin into the system and it can be detected in the blood. So, getting a blood test for troponins is one way to assess the pump. Getting an echocardiogram is another great way to assess the pump, to look directly at how the heart is functioning and contracting. If it's not contracting properly, blood can't be squeezed forward to the body. So, blood pressure, troponins, echo. Next, a really good test that is sometimes used is pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, PCWP. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. Or also assessing CVP, central venous pressure. Now, what are these abbreviations? This is a little confusing. Well, essentially these two pressures are the different pressures in the sides of the heart. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is associated with the left side of the heart, specifically the left atrium. The central venous pressure is the pressure that's seen in the right atrium. And so, these two pressures give you an idea of how the left and the right side of the heart are functioning. For example, if the left side of the heart is not pumping. Let's say, all this tissue down here gets damaged because the patient has a heart attack. This heart tissue is dying, or has died. So, now this heart tissue cannot squeeze, it can't function. And this makes blood accumulate in the left ventricle. It just kind of pools there, because the heart can squeeze hard enough to push it out. And so pressures in the left side of the heart will be higher, because this volume backs up and causes pressure on the heart. But now, these are both found by getting a pulmonary artery catheter and threading that catheter into the heart, into the right side of the heart, and then up through the pulmonary artery, deep into the pulmonary vasculature. In fact, so deep you essentially get a wedge pressure. You're wedging this probe into the pulmonary capillaries. So, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure you wedge this probe all the way up to determine that pressure. And that gives you a good indication of the left heart pressures. CVP, central venous pressure, here's the central vein. So, there's actually another part of the catheter, the pulmonary artery catheter, that has a probe that senses the pressure in the right side of the heart. So, using a pulmonary artery catheter, you can get an indication of the different pressures of the heart. And as I said, this can help you figure out what's going on. And can help you distinguish the type of shock. For example, if the heart is not functioning, like in cardiogenic shock, then you're going to have high pulmonary capillary wedge pressures. The heart is no longer functioning and can't pump blood forward. However, in an example like hypovolemic shock, meaning low blood volume, the pressures won't be very high in the heart at all. There's so low blood volume, that pressure is relatively low in the heart. So, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure may be very low. And so this is just an example of how you can distinguish between types of shock. Okay, so, we've looked at the pumps and the pipes. What else is important in shock? So, the second thing I think about is oxygen. Oxygen's kind of a big thing, it's what we need to survive. So, is the patient getting oxygen? So, probably the least invasive way to assess oxygen is through pulse oximetry. Pulse oximetry, often known as pulse ox, uses different wavelengths of hemoglobin to assess the oxygen status. So, really what you should know is that you put a little device on the finger of a patient. It shines light through the ateries and has a way to calculate how many hemoglobin molecules are oxygenated versus deoxygenated. So, it's a quick way to assess oxygen. Now, a little more invasive, and probably one of the most important tests to get in a patient with shock, is an ABG. This is an arterial blood gas. Arterial blood gasses assess several different parameters. Of course, it'll assess the oxygen in the body. But it'll also assess blood gasses such as carbon dioxide and bicarbonate. An arterial blood gas also gives you the pH, or how acidic the patient's blood is. These are very critical readings that are important to diagnose shock. So, assessing oxygen, we have pulse ox and ABG, getting that blood test. And, also, your pulmonary artery catheter can get something called the central venous oxygen saturation, SCVO2. So, this CV is central venous. Oxygen saturation of the central vein. Now, we talked about the central vein before, that was the superior vena cava and the inferior vena cava, which dump blood into the right side of the heart. So, look at this device here, the pulmonary artery catheter would actually sit inside the heart. So, there can be another part of this probe that assesses the oxygen content. Now, why is that important? Well, in different types of shock, the central venous oxygen saturation can be either increased or decreased. If the issue is cardiogenic shock, just as an example, when blood is pumped to the cells, it's pumped very slowly. And the cells, they require the same amount of oxygen that they had before. But now oxygen is getting there more slowly. And so the tissues furiously try to pick up more oxygen. And not as much oxygen returns to the heart. And that's assessed by the pulmonary artery catheter. So, less oxygen content means that tissues were pulling out more oxygen. And, in the same token, if there is less oxygen extraction, so, for example, if the tissues are flooded with fluid and there's a lot of edema, oxygen cannot get to the tissues. And so maybe more oxygen is carried back to the heart. And so that leads to an increased central venous oxygen saturation. So, first look at the pump and the pipes. Second, is the body getting oxygen? And, last of all, if the body isn't getting oxygen, is it getting damaged? Are the cells of the body and the organs getting damaged because they don't have oxygen. They need oxygen to create energy. And without energy, cells can't function. So, without oxygen cells can't function. Well, I should say they can't function in the long term without oxygen. In the absence of oxygen, cells of the body kick up what's known as anaerobic metabolism. Metabolism without oxygen. Creating energy without oxygen. And the body can't sustain this for very long. Now, the reason I mention this is a byproduct is lactic acid. This is not the most efficient process. So, in assessing if a patient has shock, is there any lactic acid that is accumulating in the body. Because this should not be present in high amounts under normal circumstances. That's a sign of shock, and that's probably between the ABG and this, these are probably the most important tests to get. So, what else, organ's can be damaged. What if the liver's damaged? If liver cells are damaged they release enzymes, just like the heart did when the heart was damaged. They have a specific name but this is test you perform to assess the liver's function. So, liver function tests are important. Now, how about the kidneys? The kidneys can also be damaged and if they're damaged, there's two things you can really look at. The first, if you do a blood test, you can get an elevated creatinine. Now, creatinine itself, unlike LFTs and triponins are not produced by the kidney. But, the kidney's job is to filter out fluid, right? If the kidney's are no longer producing fluid, then creatinine accumulates in the body. So, that's actually, creatinine comes from the muscles. So, it's a good marker to use if the kidneys stop working. And, similarly, if you see decreased urine output, that means the kidneys aren't producing urine. So, that's a sign that the kidneys have also started to get damaged or shut down. And there's lot of other ways you can assess how the organs are functioning. For example, the brain, if a patient has confusion, then that could be a sign that their brain is starting to lose its oxygen supply. And, last of all, treatment focuses on two things. And I like to say the first thing is you want to prime the pump. By priming the pump I mean we want to get the pump going. We need to put fluid into the heart to allow fluid to be pumped through. Now, this is exactly what happens in a water pump. Water needs to be in the pump to allow a pressure within the pump to push fluid forward. That's exactly how our heart works. There needs to be fluid in the heart to push forward. So, giving fluids may be a way to treat that. And, number two, tightening the blood vessels, increasing the resistance, right? We go back up here and we see systemic vascular resistance is a part of blood pressure. And the blood vessels are tightened by medications such as pressors. Medications that help improve resistance and improve blood pressure. And so by giving fluid you're trying to establish pre-load, trying to fill the heart up so it can pump. And pressors are trying to improve the vascular resistance, systemic vascular resistance.",

It's no secret that in order to produce your best work, you have to work hard at it and you have to love what you do, but more than that, you have to be inspired. Inspiration comes in many forms. And with each new episode of the series, I'll be building something completely new and different and take you on an adventure with me as I show you the people, the places, and the things that inspired it. This is Build Inspired. This is Yosemite National Park and it is incredible. The mountains, rushing rivers, the waterfalls, the crisp air-- it's truly one of the most beautiful places I've ever seen. If you've never been here, trust me when I tell you, it's worth the trip. My girlfriend and I are here on a camping trip with our friends Kim and Ethan, and I can't think of a better place to camp. Yosemite is home to some of the most incredible views in the world that you can access from any number of hiking trails in the park. After a long day of hiking the epic trails, there's nothing better than sitting around the campfire, having a beer, making dinner, roasting marshmallows, and just chatting with your friends. My challenge for this project is to build a coffee table that reminds me of sitting around the campfire with my friends, something that can capture the essence of that experience, and remind me of this time when I'm back at home. So for the design of this table, I want it to be round so that it brings in that campfire feel, so everybody can sit around the table. And for the base of this table, I'm going to be using some timbers that are going to be criss-crossed in a way that emulates that stacked, firewood feel when you go to start a fire. I'm going to be building this table out of some redwood four-by-fours. By And the reason why I chose redwood is because it's such a close relative of the Sequoias that dominate the Yosemite landscape. The design is going to be a little bit more of a mid-century, modern take on maybe wood a camp fire table would be. It's not going to be as rugged or rustic as some of the stuff that I've built in the past, but it's a new challenge for me. It's going to have some interesting joinery. It's going to take some figuring out, and I hope it comes out like I'm thinking, but I guess I'll find out. So what I'm doing is handscribing each joint where the wood overlaps and cutting it off with the trim saw. I can't tell you exactly what the angles of the joints are, because I'm playing things by eye making sure that each leg sits flat on the ground and that the top of each leg is uniform all the way around at 18 inches. That way when I put the glass on later, I don't have to worry about it rocking or being uneven. I want to add some additional strength to each joint, so I'm drilling out and adding a small piece of dowel to connect the two legs, and I glue everything together to give it some nice stability. I'm sanding the base of the table down to 220 grit and then finishing the base off with several coats of Danish oil with a light sanding between coats. So the base the table is pretty much complete and I've got the round piece of tempered glass for the top to finish off the build, and I'm psyched to show you guys what this thing looks like, so check it out. Well, that's it for this episode of Build Inspired. I hope you guys enjoyed it.

        "video_title": "HOW TO: Make Your Eyes Look Bigger!",
        "video_sub_title": "[Music] hey guys it's gender with two tips today I'm going to share with you a tip on how to make your eyes look bigger sort of that scared you a little bit if you have smaller eyes or you wish you just had bigger eyes there are many easy tricks makeup tips that you can do to create bigger more beautiful eyes and here are some of the tools and makeup products you're gonna need to create that I use a black pencil which you should definitely have and this is um like a prestige one I'm not sure if you can see it it's very small I need to get a new one it's just a black pencil so just any black pencil that you have you're also gonna need a white pencil eyeliner as well as some mascara and as well as an angular brush and a dark eyeshadow this is just from Mac just like a dark brown color also you're gonna need is some eyelash to fake eyelashes and I like using Clips japonesque they're awesome and they're really real looking and they don't you know it's not it's like a very natural look so I really really like that and it also comes with a little glue thing like that in the Box okay so the first thing you want to do is to create the eye to make it look bigger so right now I just have a little bit I'm mascara on and some eyeliner on so what I want to do is I'm going to show you how to do it so first you want to line your eye I'm just gonna do my right side so you guys can kind of see the difference after so you want to create a wing and what the wing does it helps your eye look bigger and elongates it to the to the sides of your face so we just makes your eyes look a lot bigger you also want to line underneath your waterline don't go into your waterline we're gonna do that we're gonna use that with something else so just slightly underneath and then you're gonna use your white pencil now you don't want to use too much because sometimes what people will go overboard with the white pencil and it looks really fake and it doesn't look natural the point of using the white is to make your eye whites look bigger than they are so you just want to put a light coating of this in your waterline not don't go crazy on it so just lightly like that there is white but it's not too white you don't want to look too white because it doesn't look natural and it looks funny so like that okay and then with the black eyeliner you want to soak up the oil so it doesn't smudge so what you do is you use a angle brush with the dark eyeshadow and go over your eyeliner and create that wing you can even go a little bit further like to however far you want it to be I think that usually that's about how far I go and also underneath and this creates like that really cute asian doll look and what you want to do here is you want to kind of create little triangle like this and this to kind of open up the eyes a little bit at the bottom here but not too much like that curl your lashes and put on a coat of mascara like that and false eyelashes are great for Asian eyes because Asian eyelashes tend to be a little bit more shorter and like straighter so that's when the false eyelashes come in really well so I'm going to take off one and put it on okay so I've put my glue on to the eyelashes like that now what you want to do is you want to curl them a little bit like this so it gets the shape of your eye you don't want it to go on like that because it's gonna be really hard for you to place them on and what you can do is also blow on them so they get tacky you want to put them one that they're super wet because they won't stay and then it'll be a disaster so you know kind of make the you know eyeball shape eyelash shape like that like make a little curly and blowing in a couple times and now it's tacky so now I'm gonna put it on my eyeball try and get it to focus I'm using a new camera so sorry guys if it's kind of blurry so I'm trying to figure out how to get it to work properly okay so now you're gonna close your eye and place on on each end like this and just hold it there for a minute I know it's hard to like not open your eye and like change it but it needs to be put on properly and it needs to go on for at least a couple of minutes before you take your hands off so hold them in place when you're doing that so and sometimes the edges might come off so you just need to put your hand on it and make sure that it stays on to your eyelid eyelids eyelash line okay and if you look to the side you can see if it has you know been glued on properly because sometimes it might be like higher and it might not have got gun glued on to your natural lashes so there you my right eye and my left eye big difference so you can see and then you just do the other eye and if you really want to go for a really dramatic look and you are not a big fan of the white that I put on here you can always go back and just make it dramatic and put on black liner and it's fun you can try it out with the way and if you don't like it some people not like it you can just go over it with black and that just intensifies it this is a more of like a dull look if you want to have like a bigger white around your eye then this the white does help but if you want to go for like a sexy sultry kind of look then just go for a dramatic rim your lashes I mean your eye your bottom your bottom waterline like that and then also another trick you can do is line the underneath of your top lash line like that and instantly look much bigger nicer and if you want to just extend the the end you can do that too no problem easy so it's really easy to get a really nice big I just need some eyeliner some pair of false lashes and you're good to go there are really nice and they do help make your eyes look bigger and more beautiful so I hope you guys like this video and I'll see you guys in the next one bye [Music]",

        "video_sub_title": "If you are a kid, this happens eight to ten times a year. An adult? Two to four. It's the common cold and we've all had it. Well what's the best thing to do about it? What is available to treat it? What is effective and What is not? In this video, we're gonna let you know what you can do to help you get through it. Welcome to Family Med, your medical home for practical and accurate information to help your family make healthy decisions. I'm Dr. Erik Richardson, and my passion is helping you cut through all the health information clutter out there on the Internet. If that sounds like the kind of information you or your family needs, make sure you follow along with this. Hit that subscribe button and share it with your friends. Okay, so today we're talking about the common cold. We've all had it, in fact, maybe you have it right now, and that's why you're watching this. Hopefully you've watched our last video where we talked about what is a cold, and when you should go to the doctor for it. If you're new here and you haven't seen it, then check it out, because It's got a lot of information for you. Today we're gonna approach this assuming that you have the typical cold symptoms. There isn't any concerning things that would make you want to seek additional care. Again, for a list of those refer to my other video. Today we're just gonna focus on those things that you can do for yourself, or that you can even go pick up over-the-counter that can help you get through this. When we talk about treating a cold, it's important to remember that a cold is caused by a virus, so we don't have anything that can just cure it. Antibiotics are worthless in trying to treat it, because nobody's really come up with that elusive cure for the cold. Well because of this, most treatments just focus on treating the symptoms. So what can you do for, for example, the congestion or runny nose that happens. If you're over the age of 6 then there are some medication options. The three most common are your Pseudoephedrine or Sudafed, Phenylephrine, or the nasal spray Oxymetazoline or Afrin. Your Sudafed and Phenylephrine are oral medications. The Phenylephrine is found on the shelves in all of your cold medications that have a decongestant in it. It can help some. Now your Sudafed or Pseudoephedrine is a little more effective, but this you have to purchase from the pharmacist behind the counter. Now Afrin, it can be helpful, but you can only really take that two or three days in a row. Using it any longer and your nose can get addicted to it. So, for non-medication treatments or if your child is under six years old there are some options you can try. The most helpful are Saline nasal drops. These can help relieve congestion by loosening up mucus, as well as drying up those nasal passages. In infants you can clear their congestion by using Saline nasal spray or drops, and then using a bulb syringe to clear it. It's also really helpful to do a sinus rinse, using one by Neil Med or Neti Pot. Check out my video on sinus infections for a better description of these. Also, keeping you more humid with an in-room humidifier can also provide some relief. So what do you do about those aches and pains or that sore throat? Well, the most common treatment for these are your over-the-counter pain medications, such as Acetaminophen or Tylenol, and Ibuprofen or Advil type products. These can be very effective. I'd suggest that you look at the recommended doses on the bottles. I've talked about this before in other videos, but you can even alternate taking Ibuprofen and Tylenol to help control your symptoms. Follow your doctor's advice, but I often times will recommend that my patients alternate each one every three hours, making sure that you don't take each one individually sooner than six hours. Now, be careful to avoid Aspirin in children and teenagers. This can cause a rare, but potentially life-threatening condition called Reye's syndrome. You can also use salt water gargles. Just take a teaspoon of salt, and put it in some warm water, and just gargle. The salt helps decrease some of the swelling in the throat. So what's available to treat a cough? First of all, it's important to point out that this has been a subject that has been studied quite a bit. Unfortunately there isn't anything on the market that has shown a significant level of improvement in controlling a cough. There are products available, however none of them tend to be safe under the age of four. The most common one we see in the over-the-counter medication is one called Dextromethorphan. You tend to find this as one of the ingredients in most of your multi-symptom cold medications. It can help somewhat, but nothing significant. There are some studies however that have shown a potential benefit of an antihistamine called Chlorpheniramine. This seems to be more effective for those lingering coughs that you get when you have a lot of that drainage going down the back your throat. Remember though, if you give cough medication to an older child, make sure you follow the label directions. Don't give your child two medicines with the same active ingredient. Too much of a single ingredient could lead to an accidental overdose. There are also some natural over-the-counter medications that are for sale like, for example, your Zarbee's Honey based products. These are safe to use for children over the age of 1. There isn't really any great data that suggests whether they're effective or not, but they are felt to be safe and ok to try. So those are the most common over-the-counter products that are available, but how about all of the alternative medications? What are some different supplements that are out there, and what does the data say about it? The most common alternative cold medications out there that have been studied are Vitamin C,  Echinacea, and Zinc.  So let's look at Vitamin C first. A lot of studies have been done looking into the role that it has in fighting colds. Unfortunately, there isn't a great consensus in the data. The most recent studies show that daily use doesn't seem to help prevent colds, but it does seem to help you overcome them a little bit quicker. The most success was seen when at least six to eight grams a day of Vitamin C was taken right at the onset of symptoms. This did seem to help decrease the length of a cold. In general, it's safe to take so there isn't harm in trying it and see how you respond. Now the only caveat is that those who have significant kidney disease should avoid high doses, as well as if you're pregnant. The next one's Echinacea. Studies on the effectiveness of Echinacea at preventing or shortening colds are mixed. The evidence has shown a slight trend towards benefit and prevention, but not clear enough to have a definitive answer. However, if you're otherwise healthy it's unlikely to cause harm. We're just not sure how safe it is to take long-term though, in fact there is some suggestion that use longer than eight weeks can actually decrease your immune system. So talk to your Doctor on this one, and see what they think is right for you. Okay the last one is Zinc. Zinc's another medication that is recommended frequently for treating and shortening the duration of colds. Like most supplemented medication, the data is up and down on this one, even for the common cold, but mainly I think due to a lack of good quality studies. However, when they've done a big analysis of all the different studies it does appear that taking Zinc can help shorten duration of colds. The hard part of this is that there really isn't any consensus on how much, and how often it should be used. It did show that you tend to do better if you start it right at the very onset of a cold. However, one thing you want to remember, you do want to avoid the nasal Zinc treatments, as it can be toxic to the nerves that help you smell, and can cause irreversible loss of smell. Zinc can be limited as well to its side-effects such as bad taste and stomach upset. So that's it!

In no way should it be taken as direct medical advice to you in your own situation. So please, consult your own doctor for concerns regarding your specific situation. Alright, so as a thanks for those who stuck around, here's your bonus tip. We all know that when getting a prescription, it's always cheaper to get one of those generic brands. There are some times, however, that getting a new one in the name-brand is a better option for you. If your doctor decides that this is better for you, make sure you ask him for a coupon. Most new medications have coupons that you can use if you have a commercial insurance. If they don't have one, go to the manufacturers website and print one off for yourself to take to your pharmacist. It can save you a lot of money! Well that's all I have today. I hope this was helpful! Make sure you check out our other videos for information to help you make your medical decisions. So until next time, this is Family Med with Dr. Erik Richardson. Remember, please take care of your body, because it is the only one you have!",

        "video_sub_title": "hey guys welcome to my channel if this is your first time here my name is alyssa and i am a wound care nurse from ontario canada um so i'm a wound care nurse and um on this channel i make lots of videos on different wound care supplies um products and how to use them so in this video i am going to show you how to pack a wound um because it is kind of an art how to pack a wound uh you want to kind of fluff it not stuff it so if you haven't subscribed already please hit that subscribe button and hit the little bell notification so you don't miss any of my videos once you have all your supplies prepared you can next prepare your wound base by cleaning it i normally clean with sterile saline okay so you would flush the wound now you would have the person tilt where the water is just going to flow easily out of the wound flushing it well with the whole bottle we always use the whole bottle to get out all the grime bacteria anything that might be in that wound okay so next i'm going to show you how deep this wound is okay so that's how deep the wound is uh in my model here okay and then there are different products that we can use to pack this so we have plain packing strip we have another packing strip that does have the phmb on it so it is an antimicrobial and then for very large wounds we have the curelex which is also a phm packing gauze which is very large okay that's for your very deep wounds very um to where where you need a lot to pack in there um so i have chosen that we're going to just use plain packing for this demonstration okay so it's just opened we pull the gauze out okay and so you're always going to pull out more than what you need okay you can cut it off okay and you can put some saline on this packing okay to get it moist before you pack it okay and then i'm actually gonna do that so it stays in here okay so then you're just going to pack it here with your cotton tip applicator now you just do kind of like a fan fold back and forth now you don't want to stuff it you want to make sure that you're just lightly fluffing it into the wound okay now we pack wounds because we want to um make sure that the wound has something to grab onto to grow upwards towards where the tissue should be so that's why we actually pack a wound and there will be a link in the district in the description of another youtube video of how to uh pack a wound and when when to pack a wound okay so you're just gonna cut off the excess make sure you always leave a tail especially if it's just a a very tiny hole opening okay so that's there it's just nicely fluffed in and then you would put your cover dressing over top of that so as a nurse there will be times that you come in to wounds that kind of look like this um so they're this one's circular but they can be just a little slit in the skin and they actually go in quite deep so initially when i go in it just looks about two centimeters okay but if i start probing around which you should always do to make sure i can actually get in quite deep and i'm not even hitting um hitting a base yet okay so i am this is also something that i am not going to flush because if you cannot touch the bottom you cannot get the fluid out so you never want to flush uh when you have a tunnel like that that you're not hitting an end to okay um so in this case you like you always want to look for those tunnels in case tunnels you never know where one might be okay and you want to make sure that you're packing that fully so again i'm just going to use my sterile packing here and i'm going to keep it attached this time just because i'm not sure of how much packing i'm actually going to use because of that tunnel okay and you're just going to start packing and fluffing trying to get way into the back pulling it way into the back because you do want it to just be fluffed into there not jam-packed okay so once you get a good base and bring that all the way in okay and you're just going to keep doing that fluffing it gently touching all the nuts and crannies in there because you want to make sure that packing is touching every surface so it can close but we don't want we want to make sure that we get all the way into that very very far tunnel so that it doesn't uh close and form a pocket back there um or they're just gonna form another abscess so then you'll have a big mess in there okay so like i said just nicely fluff it into the hole okay and with with holes like this um you want to make sure that you have a good tunnel or a a good tail because sometimes as as the wound um people move around it kind of gets sucked in a little bit so always i always just leave a nice long tail and then put the cover dressing over top of it so i did i do hope that this video really helped you learn how to pack a wound and i hope that if you haven't already you do subscribe to my channel to help this channel keep going and do check out all my my other videos because i do have a lot of great information out there to teach you all about wound care",

        "video_title": "PLANTAR FASCIITIS KINESIO TAPE TUTORIAL",
        "video_sub_title": "William Provost from plantar fasciitis survival bed I'm going to go over the procedure for taping the foot but not with regular athletic tape this time just with KT Tape KT port KT Tape works really good or on what other people call kinesio tape um I think it works great but you have to have mild plantar fasciitis to be able to notice any results if not I'm head over to my other video about regular taping with lukio tape or Wyeth leg tape KT Tape works great but you have to have mild plantar fasciitis unless it's not going to help you there's some things to know about KT tape is that it's very flexible when you when you cut it like this it stretches just like that and so when you put it on you want some areas to be stretched in some areas not to be stretched at all so what I mean by that is when you apply it this is when stretched then you put it on and then other places where I don't want you to stretch it you just smooth it on over the skin and that's it then you're good to go for this one I like just there's only one way that I like to tape KT Tape myself on here in the in the manuals they tell you to put it right here on the sole of the foot and then bring it up up here and then stretch it up to the top of our to the middle of the calf and then they also tell you to put it like this and then like this this works great but if you do it like this you have to stretch the heck out of it unless you're not going to know us eating good results um a taping procedure right now that I'm going to show you is what I think works really well because it supports the arch pretty well and it also uh changes it does it does a lot of other stuff up here pulls on the skin and it kind of helps the circulation go through and the lower leg all right what I want you to do first is you're gonna have a piece of KT Tape right you're gonna tear right down the middle okay if one side is longer than the other side the longer side like if this side is longer it should go on the inside of the calf if not use it does it as long as they're both the same size you shouldn't have problems alright so we have this piece and this is exactly how I'm gonna set it up for you you just take that tear you fold the pieces back and now you're gonna you're gonna hold it like this and then you're gonna stretch it you're gonna put it straight on the bottom of the foot right there and you want it to be stretched and now while holding both sides and putting it down the other side the outside edge of the calf muscle you're gonna want to put the tape straight on without stretching it so this side over here you're gonna just apply it without any stretch and just push it on onto the skin just like that and then on this side what we're gonna do so we're gonna pull it a little bit until you make it to this ankle bone right here that's called the medial malleolus it's part of the tibia you pull it up you push it right on to the medial malleolus and then for the rest of the way the the rest of the tape we want no stretch so we're just gonna apply it nice and gently like that and then you have to rub it on a lot of people like using the tape and rubbing it on I mean that works really well but it's not that hard just to push it apply it so I mean to know if you want to do another piece what you can do let's put on the bottom of the foot all right so when we tape we always want this part right here to be very flexible and mobile like when you're choosing shoes you want the shoes to be mobile right underneath the big toe joint because this needs to move and flex all the time so that air area is going to be under a lot of tension because it's always moving so what we want to do is apply it with no stretch or barely any stretch I think a little bit of stretch is good just to give it some like so I can stick better so you put no stretch or a little bit of stretch right underneath the ball of the foot and now you're gonna want to push it on right there pretty well make sure it's sticking right there now what we want to do is Tara or I mean unpeel some of it but not all of it I'm peel it until it makes it to the heel you want the ankle to be in a neutral you don't want it like this you don't want it like this you want to be very neutral and while you're stretching it then you place it all the way to the heel but you don't go past the heel yet okay so we Pat that down and that's good to go right there and then for the rest of it you can do a little bit of stretch down here I think it's important because there's a lot of connective tissue in fossa it's good to have a little bit of stretch down here and then you stretch a little bit or you don't have to stretch it all that much and then you supply it the rest all the way up just go straight up the kilise tendon doesn't matter if you go this way a little bit the other way it's all good just make sure that there's no stretch on this back portion though because then it's gonna defeat the whole purpose if there is a lot of stretch near the endings of the KT Tape it will come off really easily right now it's coming off where the two KT tapes press together because KT Tape does not like to stick to itself what I think is gonna happen well what happens is I just put it in my shoe and I walk around a bit and it pushes it straight on there and it's good to go also KT Tape will not stick to your skin if you do not wash the skin clean and you also you can put alcohol and rubbing alcohol to clean the skin and then it will stick if not it's not gonna stick for very long at all and I think that is pretty much it um if you want to put other tape on here you can put it across here you can almost mimic like my other athletic tape video you can put another piece right here you can put two on the straight bottom of the foot those ones make sure it's very clean down there unless will not stick it does not like to stick down here so make sure it's extremely clean and yeah I guess you're good to go try that out if you liked this video leave a comment down below if you have any questions leave a comment too all right well thank you good luck",

        "video_title": "Tics and Tourette syndrome - Akron Children's Hospital video",
        "video_sub_title": "- Tics are repetitive involuntary movements. And they can be split into two groups. So one is Vocal tics. And so that's a phonic sound. It's often simple. So that could be something like a throat clear, or a cough, or a grunt or even a shout. The other type is called Motor tics. And motor tics are often kind of bursts of movement. So that could be something like a nose crunch, or an arm movement or even a head jerk. Those are a series of movements. So those often look more purposeful in nature. So that could be something like a twirl or a jump, or something that even looks like a dance movement. And then there's complex vocal tics as well. And that's like a saying a series of words or sentences, but often they don't fit into what the child is talking about. Probably the most famous tic disorder is Tourette's. Tourette was discovered by George de la Tourette, who named it after himself in 1884. And Tourette's, you have to have multiple motor movements, and one vocal tic over the course of more than one year. To have a diagnosis of something like a tic disorder, or Tourette's, a lot of times that's become functionally impairing. So what that means is that gets in the way of me thinking that gets in the way of me talking to others. The other difference between just kind of having a movement and something like a tic or Tourette is something called premonitory urge. And so that's kind of like a feeling of itching or burning, or I just got to do this thing for everything to be all right. We know that tics run in families, so that means that there's a genetic contribution to that similar to hair color, or eye color or height. We also know that there might be situations in our environment that increase our tic behavior, So that could be experiencing stress or having something like a diagnosis of anxiety. Tics are Often diagnosed with other mental health diagnosis like OCD, ADHD, anxiety and learning disorders. The medication most oftenly prescribed for kids with tic disorders are often in the Atypical antipsychotic, Antiepileptics or Alpha 2 agonists family. One of the treatments that we have here at Akron Children's Hospital is something called Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics. Or CBIT for short, and so CBIT is a short term therapy. It's usually eight sessions over the course of 10 weeks and it's often with parents involved as well. And so the first part of this therapy is we try to figure out what that premonitory urge looks like for that child. So what do they experience prior to the tics. We also spend a lot of time thinking about what's going on in their environment when they're ticking more. So these kids they're having tics more in class are these kids that are having tics more when they're relaxing and playing video games? So we spend a lot of that treatment first trying to figure out those antecedent conditions. Then what we do, the keystone of CBIT is called habit reversal. And habit reversal means selecting a physical movement that I can do that's going to replace the tic and make it physically impossible to do the tic. So if I have an arm jerking tic, one of the common strategies we might use is to teach the child to feel the premonitory urge. And when they feel that urge to tic when they normally would go like this, we train them to kind of maybe hold their elbow in at their side, and we practice that together in session. And then finally, because this is a comprehensive intervention, we spend a lot of time talking about stress management, relaxation skills, being able to advocate for themselves and talk about tics. And even we work collaboratively with the schools to figure out what tics look like on the school setting.",

        "video_sub_title": "water retention is so annoying we can't tell if we're overweight or if we're just holding water it can be very very frustrating but in this video I'm gonna give you three surefire ways that you can start reducing some of that water retention but first I have to explain briefly how water retention occurs especially when it has to do with sodium you see sodium chloride is sodium and chloride just like the name implies and sodium chloride is usually in a solid form and when it combines with water for instance like you could assume or if I combined with any kind of fluid it becomes a liquid solution that liquid solution creates what is called an isotonic state in the body which causes us to retain water generally in the tissues and sometimes on top of the muscle underneath the skin so we're trying to look at when it comes to water attention and how to reduce it is how we can change up that balance and how we can affect that so we don't have that superficial layer of water you see it comes down to a super delicate balance when it comes to sodium and water within the body but a lot of people don't realize is that too little sodium can cause the body to hold on to sodium and consequently hold on to water so actually being dehydrated and not consuming enough sodium can literally cause you to hold more water and be more puffy and weigh more but additionally too much sodium and not enough water and too much sodium in too much water can cause the issue to so you see we have to be in a delicate balance there so if you've ever had a high sodium meal and you notice the next day you feel a little bit puffy maybe your face feels swollen maybe your eyes feel a little bit swollen if you're up a couple of pounds what's generally just that extracellular water that is causing that issue so let's get down to the fun stuff what are the three ways that you can reduce that bloating and reduce that water retention and get that nice jawline back that you want the first one is dandelion root okay whether you're getting it from a supplement or whether you're consuming some dandelion greens down towards the bottom of the leaf you're going to get a positive benefit you see dandelion is what is called taraxacum and taraxacum is a species of plant that a direct effect on your production you see it's simple when you're retaining excess water you want to have an increase in urine because that's gonna change the fluid volume that's gonna change that fluid balance you don't want to be doing it all the time so it was a particular day when you're feeling a little bit puffy it might not be a bad idea to take a small amount of dandelion root or add some dandelion greens to your morning juice or smoothie to help your body flush out a little bit of the excess minerals but don't overdo it in a 2009 study by the Journal of alternative and complementary medicine it was found that 17 participants that consumed dandelion root extract over a period of time all had a dramatic increase in their urine production resulting in a 5% decrease in fluid this is pretty powerful and it shows us directly that just taking some dandelion root can have a huge impact usually by the effect of what is called Tarak Sisneros which is the sterile that causes the kidneys to produce a little bit more urine the next thing you can do to help out some of that excess water retention is to take up a little bit more magnesium okay we're talking about the fact that magnesium has an affinity for phosphates in any kind of biological system what that essentially means is it's critical to helping ATP production which is art the energy powerhouse getting without that ATP we're not producing energy but if that ATP is not functioning that ATP is not being regenerated we're not having that balance between all the minerals that we need that balance between the sodium the potassium of the magnesium and that being said so many people are deficient in magnesium in fact it's been shown that only about 25% of the population is actually getting enough magnesium from their diet to begin with so why do I choose magnesium or for potassium because most people are getting enough potassium but not enough magnesium and we're on average consuming about 3.5 grams of sodium as Americans which means we have a huge imbalance of sodium magnesium potassium the quickest way to start leveling off that balance to consume a little bit more than I need this last one is one you probably don't want to hear but to be completely honest it's for an entirely different reason than you might think and that's exercise alright most people think that exercise is going to be good for water retention simply because you're going to be sweating and you're gonna be losing a lot of minerals but remember what I mentioned the very beginning of the video if we have too low of minerals then our body's going to hold on to those minerals and hold on to water to preserve it in our body you know start creating that state where your body is bloated and holding a lot of water so it's not the sweating that causes our body to excrete this so via man excrete the excess water it's more so what happens when you're actually moving you see for example the actual friction of having your muscle moving against your skin or having your muscle pushing up against water if you're swimming can physically mechanically start moving fluid out of the tissue into the bloodstream so that it can be processed by the kidneys and essentially urinate it out so you see it's more so the mechanical action of moving than it is the sweating so that being said in order to get rid of excess water all you have to do is get moving just get moving those bigger limbs like your legs or if you're gonna do something active go swimming something like that where you're actually able to have an additional mechanical effect of the water against your body that right then and there can make such a huge difference there's one study in particular that is extremely interesting when it comes to this ok I took two groups of people one group of people went into what is called the Trendelenburg position ok what that is is where your legs are slightly elevated above the rest of your body the other group of people did a simple walking exercise they just went outside and walked for a period of time what was measured was the amount of edema in their legs how much water retention was held in their legs believe it or not those that went for a walk had over 30% more fluid reduction than those that were in the Trendelenburg position that means that literally walking is going to reduce more fluid than hanging partially upside down so there you have it if you went to Chinese food you feel a little bit bloated you feel a little bit puffy go for a walk go for a little bit of a swim pop a little bit of extra magnesium and a push comes to shove take some dandelion root extract you'll be right back to the races in a couple of hours as always keep it locked in here on my videos that you can make sure you're cutting through all the fluff cutting through all the noise on the internet and start finding what works best for you your family your business and the rest of your life I'll see you next video",

        "video_title": "How To Make Your Own Natural Perfume! The Basics",
        "video_sub_title": "hi everybody so today I'm going to be sharing with you guys how to make your own natural perfumes now this is just going to be a video on basically some of my tips now I am going to be making more videos on this topic in the future but this is just going to be kind of a general overall video of how to do it and how to get the inspiration to do it so to start off let's talk about materials that you're going to need obviously there is a lot of things that you can purchase out there when it comes to making your own perfumes but first I'm going to go ahead and share the three things that I think are absolute essentials when it comes to making your own perfume so the first thing you're going to need is essential oils now essential oils are basically the natural version of you know synthetic fragrances that you can also purchase to make your own perfumes but obviously since we want to go to the Safeway the organic and natural way you guys are going to need essential oils and there is a vast variety of the essential oils out in the market out there I actually have my collection sitting right behind me and I will show you guys actually how many Suns I have I'm a huge collector of them okay so here is a box full of some of my essential oils and these are all from living libations calm I have them kind of organized by where I get them from and these are my favorites I love the ones from living libations you guys should definitely go check them out I will put the link in the description box the other boxes I have a lot of essential oils in as well and I got some I got some from aroma head Institute which I love and then a few that I get from my local store around here the next thing you guys are going to need is packaging for your perfumes now you guys can go as simple like I have or as like pretty and elegant as you want to I have here just a regular spray atomizer and this is it's alcohol-based perfume and then I have like a little roller perfume which is an oil-based perfume so you guys are definitely going to need those to store your fragrance and then the last absolute essential is a base there's a couple of different ways you can form a perfume you could have an alcohol based perfume an oil based perfume and they're all there are even some like perfume balms and I'm going to be making videos showing you guys how to do all three of them so yeah here I have just like an example this is jojoba oil this is something you could use for your oil based perfumes and as far as alcohol goes grapeseed organic grapeseed alcohol and vodka are really good ways to go now a few helpful tools these are not necessities but a few helpful tools are things like this which is just like a regular dropper and you guys can just go online and get a whole bunch of these like things like really cheap and I have a little label on it actually says Bergamo on there right now and yeah so just really simple these are really helpful most essential oils come in like little dropper bottle so you don't necessarily need them but this really helps kind of control how much goes in because the speed of how fast the essential oil comes out of the bottle varies and you don't want to just like you know completely mess up your perfume so these are definitely something to consider the next thing our little small vials basically what these are good for is experimentation before you package a gigantic perfume that you don't know for sure if you're going to be happy with these are great to make sure that you know you are happy with the perfume before you put it in a big bottle and use a whole bunch of expensive essential oils essential oils are not cheap so these are really great to you know play around with and I just buy a whole bunch of these you can get really cheap on Amazon and yeah so these are really good things to have as well another thing that is really helpful which I actually don't have out to demonstrate but I did show you guys that this has a label getting little sticky labels are really really helpful for labeling you know not just your droppers but your perfumes you guys can give your perfumes names and you know it's just it's a good way to stay organized I feel and then the last optional one is get a book where you can put all of your recipes in that you have been really happy with and this is my perfume books that I have all of my finished creations that I'm really happy and pleased with I also have some skincare recipes in here that I'm going to be sharing with you guys and I think I'll go into more detail about this little book right here in the future I'm sure you guys are probably really interested to see what's in here okay so now I'm going to talk to you guys about my tips for creating perfumes because really once you have all your materials together you can really just go at it and kind of learn from yourself and from experience and you know just have fun but these are some tips that I think will be really helpful to beginners out there so something that is really important to know when it comes to making perfumes and essential oils every essential oil is categorized into a note and there are three different kinds of notes that essential oils can be they are top notes middle notes and base notes now the top notes tend to be the aromas and the fragrance that really just is the first thing you smell when you you know you put your perfume on it's the one that springs to the top first it's like the loudest one but then it also dies out the fastest so it evaporates the fastest the middle notes are what I like to call the heart of the perfume and I really feel like that's what gives you the dimension and they're really good additional ones to have in your perfume I think it's really important to have a heart note and the base notes are basically the grand finale of your perfume it's going to be the last thing that you smell before the perfume completely evaporates from your skin so having a combination of all three of these notes will give a lot of depth and character to your perfume and I will have a list of a whole bunch of essential oils on my blog and which ones fall under each category and you know you don't have to have a perfume with all of these notes you guys can play around and do whatever you want but having a variety of notes tends to make for a really nice perfume now this next tip is about the ratio so basically how you do it how you make the perfumes like how much essential oil do you use to you know your base so basically it's very simple you don't want to use more than fifteen to thirty percent essential oils the rest needs to be either alcohol oil or you know your your bomb base you want to dilute the essential oils otherwise they tend to be really overpowering that's for sure and it also just really helps kind of mend and blend everything together I feel a ratio of 15% to 30% essential oil is a good way to go 15 being you know not very concentrated kind of like a body splash to 30% being very very concentrated I think for me I personally prefer to keep it at about 20 to 25 percent really it's all about doing the math and figuring out how much you know like 20% of your spray bottle is and the rest you just add alcohol so really really simple the last tip I'm going to leave you guys with is you guys need to realize that good things take time and this is one of the things that I have found the most frustrating about making perfumes and that is when you make your creation it is best to actually wait a month before you actually use it and the reason for that is is because the perfume will change so much in character from the day you make it to 30 days later like it is really amazing how much of a difference it makes something happens when you let it sit there and all of the oils they just mend together and everything just kind of becomes one it's really really interesting so definitely have patience good things do take time basically all you have to do is just store your perfume in a nice glass bottle and then keep it in a cool dark place for a month and then it'll be ready for you to use but if you're really impatient just go ahead and use it right away because I do that sometimes too okay so that is really the basics when it comes to making your own perfume I hope that you guys found this video helpful my blog post will be really helpful as well I'm going to have the list of the essential oils so I hope that you guys go check that out if you have any video requests please let me know if you have any questions please let me know and yeah I'm going to go and I will see you guys my next video bye you",

        "video_title": "How to fix muscle a spasm / twitch Explained",
        "video_sub_title": "good morning everyone this video is there a specific audience who have muscle spasms or twitches that might occur from working out or overuse is it's not people that have a chronic condition where they actually can't control their body and they're being hurt so if you are a kind of that person and you need to find help seek a doctor please and do not listen to this video as a way of preventing that these are only four ways that are recommended by paramedics new paramedics Health Organization's you know CPR kind of stuff that helps you relieve muscle spasms or some more biological things you can do and why they're effective to help you prevent a muscle spasm or a twitch I sometimes get a shoulder twitch right around here or right around here when I have overused my muscles chronically through working out over a long period of time this is because I have recovered enough I've been pushing my strength and pushing my volume just a little bit too much and I might get a twitch recently I actually had one of my pecs right where a stretch line actually occurred so it was kind of a way my body's telling me that I was actually growing because of that twitch occurring real Italy at the exact same point I was having a stretch mark Paulie for working out but how to prevent that is when videos like this or that could just be little things that go away after time if they keep coming up here's our tips for you to prevent tip number one actually comes from the clinic of the Cleveland Clinic on this issue specifically it's about stretching a muscle in a way that helps it reduce the twitching so what you want to do is let's say your bicep is twitching which won't do if the tip is to gently stretch and area all the way out to completion and apply a hot and cold therapy now as you do that I will explain why that has this benefit a spasm is an instance where a signal from your brain or other stimulator in that area is getting over activated and a signal mistake can happen let's say you did 100 pushups everyday like Saitama but you haven't worked out in ten years your body likely got way too big of a damage signal into check that area from injury it starts contracting to make sure it's gonna safe rep range to not be damaged at which is off of the signal to you that you should take it easy holding your bicep stretch means you start to stretch your muscle spindles which then stretch the sarcomeres this is a lot of biology but essentially those those are the lines that make up muscle fibers these are the areas where contraction occurs if you stretch them slightly you take them out of their normal range of motion which in turn reduces their ability to contract properly since the little arms that do the power stroke that's called can't reach sir come here for you the short term effect is you stop twitching or you start having a reflex now here's where the hot and cold remedy kicks in while your arm or shoulder is stretched its surface area has increased so any treat when you put on that area will greatly affect the region hot and cold therapy can often produce as increasing circulation and reducing inflammation response heat therapy allows for a greater circulation because it causes vasodilation the pupils are essentially see your eyes get wide essentially your blood vessels in the surrounding tissue start to open up how much blood that can take in to help that area so more blood can get in more new training in more immune responses it can happen cold therapy has an interesting effect where it reduces the amount of inflammation an area can take because energy is now constrained due to heat loss now that's really the biggest tip that most doctors recommend for patients is stretching in hot and cold therapy but here are some more tips if that institute that issue isn't actually caused by an overuse syndrome or an overuse situation from working out now that if you applied therapies that region here's some other small tips sometimes you get cramps or twitches from having an unbalanced electrical system or tenacity as it's called in your body perhaps you sweat a lot from kind of grass or working out and you haven't eaten some nutrient dense foods lately your electrical balance could be off resulting in a crimp this happens because your body works with tons of little different signals one of those is your electrolyte balance and if they get out of whack they can trigger contractions all of their own because they handle contraction signals or when a contraction starts it can be very hard to let it go since electrolytes aren't there to undo that effect this easy fix in the situation it's drinks from g2 or some Gatorade since you could be low on salt potassium or calcium in many other situations or you could look for an electrolyte drink add-on that might see in a first aid section I like a Shoppers Drug Mart these people who might have heat stress but it has all the same luxury lights you need in a balance that's perfect for you but lastly again if this cramp or twitch is actually hurting you in any kind of way you cannot let go of your arm please consult doctor could it may be a muscle tear and maybe something else and your body's trying to react by not letting you actually move to maintain the health and strength tissues to maintain the tissues in that area from tearing any further so I hope you had a great day in Brugger fitness limits this has been nicholas danger on how to fix a muscle spasm or twitch because it because for many different reasons hope you had a great day in Brooke you're finished limits awakened games",

        "video_title": "10 Best Exercises for Degenerative Disc Disease (Low Back) with or without Sciatica",
        "video_sub_title": "and Brad the to motivate this physical there is only today oh the folks I'm Bob Shrum physical therapist Brad any physical there is most famous physical therapist on internet and our opinion of course my gender of dis disease or sciatica of the low back we're going to show you 10 best exercises you can do for this right so the question is are we talking about DDD or degenerative disc disease or sciatica or low back pain could be all the same right right you could have all three and one or it could be separate but I do want to kind of hit on this degenerative disc disease and I've had people be worth comment on it and I think it's one of those terms I really feel pretty confident that it's overused and it's a misnomer sounds terrible right say I mean I got a disease right and he isn't a disease it's more degeneration it's aging right so almost cases why I listen to a couple therapists so I went did some research on it I found a nice article by dr. Peter Ulrich and he came up with these that exact same or very similar thought so it's exactly that it's a misnomer not a disease it's a pain from a lesion or in other words a problem with the disc and it may be that the disc is shrinking and over-aged all of our just do shrink you know we get a day's walk they lose water and they get smaller and they write compress down right that's simplifying it but basically that's what it is a simple line and the thing is about what we'll show you one right here as a matter of fact this this model how does that look line you got it hold up and share so you don't have if you have a disease disc it's not read like this it's just this model so you can is easy for instructional educational purpose there's a disc but you can see the thickness of this disc this and all these are thick and which indeed is right this was much thinner this one could be considered a degenerative disc disease and also has a herniation as well and that may be part of the problem that all works together and then because of this you get sciatica so you can kind of see how and we'll colossal error can you see how these two bones come together that this hole gets smaller right where the nerve the spinal nerve right out that's called the foramen fragment just means a hole and yeah if that hole gets too small you pinched a nerve sciatica occurs it's easier to pinch the nerve to it you know I not necessarily is it going to pinch it all the time but there's not a lot of romance up there right inflammation and Eric it narrows up that hole exactly exactly I'm going to show you another actually an x-ray of the same devil yep and yet we're looking at it from this angle if we look at some x-rays okay these are real-life x-rays lady like this yep they're your dongle yep so here's l2 which we're at here then l3 and l4 now look at here between l4 and l5 there is literally no disk between these two discs and actually this particular back has something called spondylolisthesis and this is a shifted forward and we have no disk and actually this this down here is change shape it's pie shape and it should not be that way it should like this so we got two discs here with this with problems right exactly now the other thing that dr. Aldridge brought up was the fact that oftentimes with time the disc can degenerate worse but the pain can improve right it's just good news and actually this one has done that exact same thing and because this is my spine this is my expertise taken in 2000 yeah this 2013 and here four years later my back is improving although am treating it properly usually doing exercises but let's go through some exercises that you can I think they do is a point here that we Brad and I try to make quite often is the body has a great capacity for healing right if you allow it and you do things to make it not worse it over time we'll try to solve the problem exactly most cases by the way if you're new to our Channel please take a second to subscribe to us we have a subscription button over here or down below we provide videos on us to healthy fit pain free and we upload every day when Bob alright start off with some extra okay so the whole concept Bob is we're talking about the core okay to support the muscles around the back that are having a problem and not only that but learn your back so that you know where the neutral position is so if I arch my back this way mm-hmm that's one end range we call it and if I go the belt is kind of slanted down yep on that one and then if I go this way I'm rounding my back that's the opposite direction we'd like to find kind of a midpoint in there and that's where we want to strengthen our muscles and so we keep that back in that mid range keep your pelvis in those neutral zone exactly exactly okay you always start out with your lay down or you want to do another one I tell you what no you do the first ones because I'm going to do the ones with the ball okay and besides I wanted to take I wanted to sit down roll around on my stool a little bit there you go ahead a pillow laying down these do work better on a carpeted floor you can do it on your bed if it's a firm bed it's better if you're unable to get down to the floor for falling purposes and go on to bed but firm bed is best okay first thing double knees to chest Bob would you start probably with single bread yeah we can maybe just stretch a little bit like this like then we're going to have 11 exercises and 10 all right well I don't always one for bonus so I'm stretching this a little bit pressure on pressure pressure on pressure off yep and then I'll bring them both up there you go it is a good idea and really does feel good on your back pressure off now we've got pressure level exercise your as Bob is exercising you're probably going to find two or three of them that feel good and those are the ones are going to focus on if any of them hurt you just stop yeah we always try to make that suggestion find the movement that you can do that's going to be paying for your make your pain better right and that's the one you keep repeating exactly so it's always an experiment isn't it exactly next one Brad let's go to hook line rotation okay so you can bring your legs up and then you're just in your roll back and forth like this and again you might find one direction that feels better yeah we'll work that one if it will feels better just going to the right just go to the right a-and over time you know if the goal is better to left or left it and you can maybe even go way over like this notice how Bob's shoulders are flat I ain't holding the whole truck so that way we get some range of motion in the rotation in the low back you could even vent your way out here Brad if you want if that feels good you DEP okay and you want to extension in line then well yes actually good a good idea yep okay the front this is this is one that might make it worse but you I would try it yeah I would too Oh Bob look at your shirt it's not tucked in and are we going to alg\u00fan what are they going to say the people are going to start talking sloppy okay here we go to Bobby okay now I do want me to go up on to elbow maybe a little bit ever subscriber mated a static stretch another is not moving if it feels good hang out there for a while only prop if it hurts right away you might try it for five or ten seconds if it keeps hurting go back down yeah and then go to the push-up position Bob and then I'm going to go probably halfway up to first start either and see again is it making my pain better is it making it worse is it spreading the pain out if it's spreading the paint out it's getting worse right so you want to see the pain get a little more localized if you have pain across your belt line and maybe down in your buttocks you want to usually it'll come closer to the center of the back if that's the case you're doing the right thing I think most people know right away Brad this is good right we go oh this feels really good art no it doesn't feel really good especially in this case and if it feels good you mean you can work your way all the way up right and try to get to the point where the pelvis is down the arm is straight don't go like this where you're pulling the pelvis up you're not doing anything then right you're doing some core we're doing some core work that's about it yep let's go Brad what's next yeah I just wanted to mention if you happen to our watching this video and you have pain numbness tingling all the way down your leg then I'd work with that a little bit and see if the symptoms come out of your leg that would be a good thing if you just have back pain with this then we do it exactly how we mentioned it the next one a pelvic tilt straight back on your back again this one often times we start out with because it's a basic range of motion this is going to work but good with your mic on here because we can watch that to tilt okay so there we go I'll see ya so he's pushing his stop his back down yeah I'm consult if Brad had his hand in there I would actually squish his hand oh I'm just kidding but I can feel it squish my fingers so I'm moving the pelvis like this oftentimes this ejection is what people are going to need to do it also helps those core muscles strengthen your back if you've never done any core exercises this is a great place to breathe oh they'll hold your breath while you're doing this this is a good one to wake up in bed and do a few of these breath yeah you know and sing with the rotation since we could want to start off with people are going to ask about how many I'm going to say ten is a good place to start yep and you can go up to 15 and gotta get a feel once you've zero down on the exercises you like then that number can increase as long as it feels good and it gives you good result right all right well we're next well we want to do the pointer dog okay you don't want your supine crunches we're going to do that with the ball well I'll tell you what Bob let's do this I want to do this one kaveri okay i want to use the ball one okay this is the way we work sometimes let me think about our exercises okay so supine crunches i don't care for the pillow i like to do them like this cost like that get your tie organized actually we don't do these at home with our tie okay and we're just thinking about getting their head and shoulders off the table it's not like this but it's like oh so you don't stress that neck there we go and you don't have to do this thing where you go all the way up like that that's actually hard on your low back okay we want to just work it up to here well when I do these I get my upper back to crack and feel good it's a wonderful oh yeah it's wonderful now the other thing you can do can I have that ball Bob again you put that right under my legs if you happen to have a bla use it for core exercises because it is one of the best things in my opinion for core exercises you can do the same thing with your feet on the ball and then if that's if you're getting stronger you lift them both up at the same time ball comes up elbows to the knees and they know they can't touch it doesn't matter and the nice thing about doing this on a firm surface on the floor Bob is it forces your back to stay in that neutral position sure you're I'm flattening my back just like we talked about before and I'm doing a nice job of strengthening that muscle this is a bonus too if you want to roll back and forth it's kind of like the hook line rotation okay good now the last two I want to cover is hold that please job the infamous pointer dog you arch your back bring it up and then go halfway in between tighten up your stomach muscles we're really doing some good core strengthening here these everyday bread can I have the ball yeah if you have a ball I encourage you to do it like this because if that hurts your back there's a good chance that this is going to make your back feel better with the same exercise you can hear my voice now I can talk freely I started with it was this way and I progress to though it was horrible yeah because it was harder and you can bounce on the ball it's kind of fun oh darling all right in Brad's world he's going to knock all stuff over and we're gonna tear the head Department apart here Wow Fred we're not just pretty we're pretty ugly no we're pretty hello that's right hopefully I would we do a good job helping some people on sir you",

        "video_title": "Review & Demo: Revlon \"Star Attraction\" Magnetic Nail Polish HD",
        "video_sub_title": "hi everyone welcome back to my channel today I'm here to review a couple of really cool new nail polishes they're actually from Redlands new collection called star attraction now the color on the left is a beautiful blue shimmery color called pop star and the one on the right is a beautiful shimmery deep burgundy color called star watch now with this nail polish collection there is a little magnet glue to the top of every nail polish handle and what you'll notice is that my nail polish bottle on the right actually is missing its magnet so I recommend to double-check your polishes before you buy them to make sure that the magnet is glued to the handle correctly so what you want to do is to make sure you start off with a nice thick coat of the magnetic nail polish and make sure you give it some time to dry so this is what my nails look like after I've given some time to dry so let's go ahead and put on our second coat and see what the magnetic magic is all about so when painting the second layer I recommend putting on a thick layer and taking our time to make sure that your entire nail is covered so as soon as you're finished painting on the second layer you'll want to take your nail and put it as close as you can to the magnet without actually touching your nail to the magnet you'll want to leave your finger here to the magnet for at least 5 seconds and then once you remove you'll see a really cool effect on your nail since you'd be completely honest with you guys I really can't get over how cool this effect looks on my nails so I'm gonna go ahead and finish painting the rest of my nails repeating the same steps that I did earlier in just in case any of you are wondering I actually purchased both of my nail polishes over at Walgreens for about $10 each so here's what my nails looks like once I'm all finished up and personally I'm loving the effect of this magnetic polish is giving my nails and I can't wait to see how the blue one turns out so that further ado let's go ahead and move on to the blue polish so this is what my nails look like with one coat of the blue polish so the nails are still a little bit wet let's go ahead and give it some time to dry and we'll go ahead and move on with the second coat so my nails are finished drying now and let's go ahead and move in with the second coat so I went ahead and flipped over my brush so that the magnet is exposed over the wet nail polish and I give it about five seconds to let the magic happen so right off the bat I notice that this effect is a little bit harder to see on the blue polish but nonetheless if you catch it at just the right light it's still a beautiful effect so let's go ahead and finish up my nails repeating the same exact steps and this is how my nails turned out once I was finished painting them and I must say that this polish is beautiful I can't get over how pretty it is it's really funny you might laugh at me but it kind of reminds me of sun rays if the sun was actually blue but that's what it reminds me of i think it's a gorgeous color i can't get over how pretty this polishes so here what my nail polish looks like side-by-side and I must say the color on the left at first I thought that it was kind of dark and you couldn't see the effect as much but I must say after giving it some time to dry the effect is very obvious and very beautiful and the last for the nail polish on the right it is a lot darker than the blue color but I must say I do enjoy this color quite a bit it's really a perfect color to wear around the holiday or winter season and yet it still gives you a subtle magnetic nail polish in fact that's not too loud but still gives a slight statement and that brings us sadly to the end of my review thank you guys so much as always for watching I truly hope you guys enjoyed this and found it helpful please do give this video a thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe and I hope to hear from you guys again very soon bye everyone",

        "video_title": "How to Make a Swimsuit Cover Up EASY! | Sewing Projects for Beginners",
        "video_sub_title": "[Music] hey everyone how's it goin Monica here and welcome back to call me cat creations but there's still a little bit of summer left I decided to make a DIY swimsuit cover-up tutorial gonna be a really easy cover-up to make and I just think it's so pretty and flowy and it would look great in so many different colors or patterns you can make it full length like maxi lengths like I did or you can make it shorter so it's totally customizable to what you like I really hope you'll enjoy this one and if you do make sure to give the video a thumbs up and I would love it if you could subscribe for more and let's go ahead and get sewing you'll need about two yards of a lightweight stretchy fabric so that the cover-up is easy to get on and off and has that light airy effect and you'll also need enough quarter-inch thick elastic to wrap around your chest begin by holding your fabric up however you want the pattern to go on your cover-up if you have a pattern but you'll need to make sure that the fabric will stretch this way so that it's easy to take on and off wrap the fabric around your back then bring one side around you so that the edge of the fabric hits right underneath your underarm wrap the other side around you and use a straight pin to mark where the fabric hits under that underarm which shows where you'll need to cut the fabric to create the cover-up lay the fabric onto your work surface and find the point that you marked with the pin on the top edge cut straight down from that point where you place the pin all the way down to the bottom edge of your fabric although I couldn't fit this part on camera to decide how long to cut the fabric wrap it back around you decide where you want the cover-up to end and place a pin one-and-a-half inches lower than that for seam allowance I wanted my cover-up to end at my heel so I place the pin one-and-a-half inches lower than my heel we'll cut straight across the fabric starting where you place that pin and this will create the bottom edge of your cover-up once you him it and I'd be elastic at the top it'll be the length you wanted at this point you should have a large rectangle where this distance is where you wrap the fabric around you from underarm to underarm and this distance is your desired length plus one and a half inches I've zoomed in here to the bottom edge of the fabric so that we can hem it make sure your fabric is laying with the wrong side facing up and fold the bottom edge over about a quarter of an inch once then fold it over again another quarter inch and pin it into place repeat this process by double folding the next few inches twice a quarter inch at a time pinning and continuing along the entire bottom edge until the whole thing has been double folded and pinned into place sew along the bottom edge with a ballpoint needle to secure the hem and always remember to backstitch whenever you start and stop sewing you can use any stitch you'd like for this because the hems won't need to be stretched at all I used a regular straight stitch but if you find that the hem doesn't lay flat enough with a straight stitch you could use a wider zigzag or decorative looking stitch which will flatten out the hymn better when you reach the end the bottom edge has been neatly hemmed now you'll need to head to one of the sides of your fabric to him it as well make sure the wrong side of the fabric is facing up and fold over the raw edge twice a quarter inch at a time and pin it into place just like before continue double folding and pinning all the way up that entire side of fabric and sew to secure the him next you'll need to go to the opposite side of your fabric and repeat that entire process of double folding and pinning along that side and then sewing the hem down here as well bring the fabric back around your back so that the correct side of the fabric is facing outward just like you'd wear it and you'll see that both sides are hemmed but we've left the top edge completely raw and untouched for now wrap both sides of fabric back in toward your underarms just like you did in the beginning and pin the edges in place to secure them you'll then want to sew just a couple of stitches on each side where you pin the fabrics which will tack them down and keep the fabric in place so carefully remove the cover-up so those couple of stitches right near the top edge and here you can see the stitches I sewed which secures the cover-up and will make the next step easier turn the cover-up inside out so that we can create a casing for our elastic to go through around the top edge both the top edge over a half-inch once then fold it over again another half inch and pin it into place and when you're working on the front side where the fabrics overlap make sure you're folding both layers of fabric over together continue folding the top edge over twice 1/2 inch at a time repeating this process around the other side of the cover-up until the entire top edge has been double folded and pinned into place so we round the top to create the casing but make sure to leave a couple inch on tone to feed your elastic through and you'll need to sew right near the edge that's been folded and pinned where I'm pointing to so that you leave enough room for your quarter inch elastic to fit through it's very important that you sew this step with either a stretch stitch or a zig zag stitch so that the top edge of your cover-up will be able to stretch around you without breaking the seams because the regular straight stitch would break when stretched remember to stop sewing and leave that gap when you get back around near where you started sewing and as you can see here by using a stretch stitch the seam stretches with the fabric they're elastic around your chest stretching it slightly as you do so and pin it together to make sure it's comfortable and secure enough to be able to hold your cover-up around you remove the pin make a mark at the amount you need then cut it about a half inch larger than that mark for seam allowance click a safety pin on one end and find the opening you left in the stitches on the top edge of the cover-up push the safety pin through that opening and feed the elastic through the casing but be careful so that you don't twist the elastic at all when you pull it back out unhook the safety pin and leave the two ends of elastic on top of each other then sew back and forth several times with a zig-zag stitch to secure them now you just need to pull on the fabric to get the elastic to lay completely flat inside the casing so to close up the opening and adjust the fabric so that it's gathered around the top edge evenly and you're all done with this basic easy to sew cover-up thanks for watching and have a great day bye [Music] Oh ha ha",

        "video_title": "Achilles Tendon Rupture Stretches & Exercises - Ask Doctor Jo",
        "video_sub_title": "Hey everybody, it's Doctor Jo, and today I'm gonna show you some stretches and exercises for achilles tendon rupture. Let's get started. With an achilles tendon rupture, sometimes you're gonna need surgery anyways, depending on how sever it is, but you can do the exercises before and after to help you with your recovery. The stronger you can be before your surgery, if you're gonna have to have it, the better your recovery is gonna be afterwards. So the first stretch is gonna be a calf stretch. You can stretch the calf in a whole bunch of different ways, today I'm gonna show you one with a strap. You can use a strap, you can use a belt, you can use a dog leash, those are really nice cause they have loops in them. Or you can use a big towel. It's really called a towel stretch, so that's usually the thing people use the most. What you want to do is wrap it around the ball of your foot. You don't want it to be too low, and you don't want it to be on your toes cause it might slip off and hit you. So just wrapping it around the ball of your foot there, relax your ankle, try not to move it actively. You're just gonna move it with the strap. So relax it, and then pull towards you until you feel that stretch underneath there. Now remember, if you have a rupture, or if you have a strain in that achilles tendon, it's gonna be pretty sore. You don't want to push through the pain, you just want to pull it until you kind of feel that a little bit of pain and you're like 'if I went more, it would hurt a lot.' And just hold it there for about 30 seconds, and relax it. And do that 3 times. So a nice big pull. Try and keep your knee straight, try not to bend it, keep it nice and straight. And again you're gonna feel it underneath there. You're gonna feel it in that achilles tendon area, holding it for 30 seconds. Alright, the next ones are gonna be standing up. So the next ones are gonna be something where you want something sturdy like a chair or a counter top so you have something to balance on. It's gonna be another calf stretch. This time you're gonna put your foot back behind you. Keep your foot straight, don't turn it out. Keep it straight. And keep your back heel down. The back leg is gonna stay straight for the calf stretch, and you can bend your front one forward like this. Until again you feel a stretch back through there. So coming forward. Hold that stretch for about 30 seconds. Come back up. And do that 3 times. Just coming forward as far as you comfortably can. Not pushing through pain, just getting a good comfortable stretch. The next stretch is gonna be a soleus stretch. And that is the muscle that's underneath the calf muscle there. So this time you're gonna bend the knee. Still keeping that foot straight, still keeping the back heel down, but this time bend your knee. So it feels a little awkward with this one. You can bend both knees and then come forward. And a lot of times you'll feel the stretch there, sometimes people fell a little bit in the front cause you're bending at your ankle a little bit more, but keeping that knee bent, keeping that heel down, holding it for about 30 seconds, and then coming back up. Do 3 of those. Bending that knee coming forward. Now we're gonna do some exercises to get it moving a little bit. So this one is just gonna be a simple heel raise. Put your feet about shoulder width apart. Hold on to something sturdy if you need it. And then just bring those heels up off the ground. Now the important part of this one is slowly come back down. Use that control cause that's really gonna work that achilles area, that calf area, not just letting gravity bring you back down but coming up and really controlling it coming back down, nice and slow. Start off with just about 10 of these, even if you're not feeling sore at the time. Let you're body kind of recover and then the next day if it feels fine, then you can start working up from there. And then the last one is just a balance series. So this time, just standing on one foot. If you need to hold on a little bit, you can. Start off with both hands. Start with maybe 15 - 20 seconds of balancing. If you can do that, then just hold on with a finger or two. And then if you can do that, maybe just one finger. And then once you build up to it, then just try balancing without holding on. Start off with 10 - 15 seconds, and work your way up to 30 seconds to a minute. And there you have it. Those are your stretches and exercises for Achilles tendon rupture. If you have any questions, leave them in the comments section.

        "video_title": "Speed Up Metabolism with Foods That Boost Thyroid Function | Hypothyroidism",
        "video_sub_title": "you've probably heard that your thyroids run to your metabolism but how does that work and can you improve your thyroid function just by making better food choices hi I'm dr. Becky from dr. Becky Fitness calm the college instructor on the science of nutrition and in this video I'm going to share with you the nutrients that your thyroid glands need to run your metabolism at its optimal level so let's start with how the thyroid hormones run your metabolism and here's the thing every cell in your body must have thyroid hormone in order to create energy so every cell in your body has these little so this is a cell where it's just a normal little circle for it for demonstration every cell in your body has equal little organelles called mitochondria the job of a mitochondria is to take food energy which is sugar and convert that into an energy source that the body can use which is ATP okay so the mitochondria it's job is to pump out usable energy ATP but mitochondria won't do that unless they're told to do so by your thyroid hormone okay and the active form of your thyroid hormone is t3 so I like to think of t3 as the plug that plugs into your water cond RIA so they're capable of pumping out energy so in order for this mitochondria or yourself to make energy t3 I get inside the cell and it's got to plug into the light of Kandra and now energy comes out so sugar molecules pull in ATP comes out Matt and you have trillions of these cells in your body and all of these cells are getting thyroid hormone and they're pumping out energy so when you have just the right amount of thyroid hormones circulating through your body then this is just a well-oiled machine and so you are constantly pumping out energy every cell you're getting this huge cumulative effect of energy you feel vital you feel alive and you're just always full of energy that's how things are supposed to work but what if this not the way it's working what if something's going wrong and you don't have this t3 working for you well that is what hypothyroidism is all about something is going wrong if some stage in the process that so that t3 is not getting in here and plugging into the mitochondria so a couple of different places things can go wrong you might not be able to you might not be producing the thyroid hormone from your thyroid gland which is a little people and it sits in your neck here or you might have fiber normally in your body but it's inactive so it hasn't it's having trouble converting from the inactive form of thyroid hormone to the active form or you are having problems getting the active thyroid hormone into your cells where they can do their job okay so each one of those areas where things can go wrong either making the thyroid hormone activating it or removing the active form into yourself guess what it has to do with specific nutrients that you need to get into your diet and that is how your diet affects your thyroid function which affects your metabolism so let's look at each nutrient specifically talk about the foods that you want to eat to get these nutrients so you can get your metabolism howling along so to make thyroid hormones so your thyroid gland pumps out hormones you need a dime and tyrosine iodine is we we tend to think of iodine I think with salt and we think of iodized salt which is one way to get that into your diet but you can also think of salty food so seaweed salt water fish like tuna would have iodine in it so those would be things that you can add to your diet to give your thyroid some good support tyrosine is an amino acid that's a building block of protein so we find tyrosine often in our meats red meat is a good source of tyrosine chicken eggs fish are good sources of tyrosine so if you think about it here tyrosine comes from animal animal products mainly so I know I have a lot of people that follow me on YouTube that are interested in vegetarian or vegan diets and I will tell you that those types of diets are not the best for supporting your thyroid so if you choose to follow that type of a diet you may need to supplement your diet with a good thyroid multivitamin I recommend one that was formulated by dr. Amy Myers who is a prominent doctor that deals with thyroid problems and autoimmune issues and I will link to my blog post that talks about that multivitamin if you're interested in that okay so then activating the thyroid hormone so you have a lot of different types of thyroid hormones floating through your body some of them are inactive and some of them are active you have inactive thyroid hormone called t4 that's sits in your tissues so it's there it's readily available when you need it it can get converted to the active form which is t3 but in order to do that that's what painting couldn't we need some nutrients right the nutrients that help to convert inactive to active thyroid or selenium iron and Zink here again these can all be found in red meat but these can also be found in plant seeds as well your leafy greens and specifically spinach are good sources of selenium zinc iron as well some leafy greens you can also find selenium we think of a lot of times with Brazil nuts are very rich in selenium nuts and seeds are also going to have a good supply of zinc and then as well so you do want to have those types of foods nuts and seeds leafy greens in your diet to support your tire or again you want to be feeding them on a regular basis on a daily basis lastly moving your the tea tray deee active form of thyroid hormone into yourself is going to require healthy fat and that is because this membrane that is around yourself well it is mostly fat so giving yourself healthy fats is going to support that cell membrane that is going to make it much easier for thyroid hormone to cross into yourself so omega-3 fatty acids we think of those with fatty fish those would be like your tuna wild salmon sardines are high in omega-3 but also your nuts and seeds flax seeds things like that we're going to have Omega threes in them alright so those are foods that that you can get into your diet to help support your thyroid function but what about foods to avoid well I don't have room to put them here but let's go over a couple of those of things that you're eating maybe in your depth daily diet now that are causing damage to your thyroid hormone pacific problems with what we're talking about inflammatory foods gluten and dairy proteins so specifically these proteins the gluten and dairy proteins cause damage to the lining of the gut leaky gut is really what what I'm getting at now that leaky gut is such a simplified term I think sometimes it's we don't maybe take it serious as the implications that can have for our thyroid but it does become a very serious situation so basically what leaky gut is is that you have a lining in the wall of your digestive tract that is very tight junctions when you have leaky gut you literally have spaces developed between those cell junctions now those those proteins and other food particles can pass out of your intense your intestinal tract and get into your bloodstream when they're in your blood your immune system sees them and doesn't recognize them so it attacks them now here's how leaky gut ties in with your thyroid gluten and dairy proteins tend to look a lot like your thyroid cells so it's called a molecular mimicry so when these proteins gluten and dairy get into your bloodstream your immune system starts to attack but because the thyroid cell looks like those proteins will guess what the thyroid cells also become a under attack as well so it's kind of like they become victims of friendly fire and that damaged thyroid gland is now not going to be able to pump out the need a thyroid hormone and you end up with hyperthyroidism another thing that another food that can be damaging to the intestinal tract is sugar so a lot of times we think well I'll just do an artificial sweetener well I took a little bit more about this on them on the blog but one in particular one type of artificial sweetener called Splenda will actually give you problems with absorption of zinc and iodine so if you are relying heavily on Splenda and you feel like you might have some thyroid problems going on you want to cut that out okay and also we talked about the need for healthy fat to build this cell membrane well the opposite works as well so for eating a lot of unhealthy fats in our diet then we can damage this cell membrane and will have a harder time getting fibroid hormone into the mitochondria to plug them in so we can get that energy out harmful fats trans fats hydrogenated oils I'm tend to look at ingredients list it's hydrogenated is in that ingredients list or the dwarfs or the oil which are often hydrogenated stay away from that okay so some boy is a big topic um it has a lot of different avenues I go into more detail over at my blog post you might want to check that out also I put together a list of ten foods that you really should be eating to support your thyroid function if you would like that list in a downloadable form even I will put a link here on the video and you can go ahead and pick that up that's it for today I hope this was helpful and if it was please subscribe to my youtube channel and I will be back with a similar bear bye",

but i have been seeing tons of these twirling um self twirling curling irons just popping up all over the place all the different brands are making them so i decided that i was going to jump on the bandwagon kind of figure out for myself what the buzz is all about and the one i ended up with i'm going to use in my demo today is the twirl 360 by t3 it's absolutely stunning as you can see but it also works really well and i'll kind of like fill you in on some of the details of this as we're doing the video so stay tuned if you want to learn how to get these beachy kind of bouncy loose waves in a super short amount of time also working with shop style on this video so you'll see pop-ups throughout the video that will have links to all the products that i'm talking about so it's kind of a cool interactive video and i think you guys will really like it so if there's something you see you can click on it and go directly there which is so cool and i'm really excited to try it out for my first time so stay tuned and let's get started to prep the hair before i started i worked in this blow dry it spray by l'oreal just to cut down on my blow dry time and give some heat protection and then for a blowout bomb i love the r co park avenue blowout balm it is just awesome for smoothing the hair and giving a little bit of grip and texture so that these curls will hold nicely now one thing that you need to know about working with a self twirling curling iron is that you have to keep them with the cords moving down towards the floor this way the hair can naturally wrap up around the barrel as it spins and you're also able to keep those ends out so that you get that loose organic beachy wave that we're going for if you want something to be more polished then you need to make sure you tuck those ends all the way underneath the clamp here is a close-up of the twirl 360. it has this really cool gyroscope technology so it senses the way you turn your hand and automatically rotates the barrel that direction this really makes it super fun to use and it speeds up your time because you don't have to switch any buttons or anything like that it's just all automatic but there is a little bit of a learning curve i'm not going to lie i did feel pretty fumbly at first but just stick with it until you get used to it and then it makes it so much faster so you can see i'm just continuing to use large sections about two inches worth of hair and i'm rotating some of them towards the base and some of them away from the face just so that i get a lot of movement and texture and gives that beachy look that we're going for and again all of the ends are being left out so that they're a little bit straighter here on the bang this is one of my favorite tips it's a nice little secret you can heat up the piece there and then use a cold can of hairspray to rapidly cool it down but also to lock in a really big bouncy moving piece around the face so it takes a little bit of extra time but it's totally worth it to get that movement and that bounce that we're going for so i'm just heating up that section of hair and you almost can use it like a flat iron because it's so smooth and then using the curling um the can of hairspray excuse me to give that extra lift and bounce and then the great thing about this iron too is because it has a large clamp space you can use it manually like a regular curling iron and roll it in just without even using the spin button so it gives you a lot of options and a lot of control so for these front pieces where i need a lot of detailed work i like to just manually roll it in on those shorter pieces just for some extra control so here again you can see i am using it almost like a flat iron to smooth and then to give a little bit of arc and heat up that hair and once i feel like it's pretty toasty and hot i'll quickly grab my can of hairspray and wrap it around and then hold it for a minute or two while it cools for that big bouncy curl that i love around my face so be sure you try that it makes a huge difference just finishing up here wrapping these last sections around the face and you can see again that time i didn't use the twist button i just wrapped it in for extra control and detail to finish up the look i wanted to add some texture into the hair this is a great texturizing spray by redken it's called wind blown and it's similar to a dry shampoo but it doesn't have any white flake or particle in it it just gives that like burst of texture through the hair and then to finish the overall style spritz with a little bit of hairspray on the part just to smooth any flyaways and then again around my face to lock in that big bouncy curl that i love for the ultimate beach wave i hope you guys liked this tutorial and learned something new be sure you try it and if you do make sure you show me your before and after pictures too thanks so much for watching and of course to pop sugar and shop style for partnering with me on this video",

        "video_title": "Preventing Workstation Repetitive Strain Injuries",
        "video_sub_title": "hello everyone i am dr donald lozello of championship chiropractic in las vegas nevada welcome to today's episode of dr rozelle sports medicine report today i'm going to cover prevention of repetitive strain injuries repetitive strain injuries are also known as repetitive stress injuries and cumulative trauma injuries they also may be known as occupational overuse injuries and just generally overuse injuries what i'm going to speak about today is how repetitive strain injuries occur at our computer workstations and how we can prevent those injuries i already went over ergonomics in an earlier video so i'm going to have a link to that video at the end of this video and also in the comments section but i just want to go over some of the general guidelines when we speak about computer workstation ergonomics you want to have the top of your monitor at eye level you want to make sure that you have a lumbar support and if all possible to have cervical support you want to try to keep your wrists in a neutral position you do not want your wrist to be flexed to be extended to be deviated in either direction you want to try to keep your wrists in a neutral position in line with your forearms now those are just some very basic guidelines for ergonomics but proper ergonomics helps a great deal in preventing and helping you to recover from a repetitive strain injury another key is computer workstation motions i have a video about this i'm also going to have a link to it in the comments section so you can check out that entire video but what you want to do is take frequently calculated breaks schedule your breaks every 15 or 20 minutes stand up close your eyes or focus on an object that is far away and you can perform neck motions shoulder motions elbow motions spinal motions wrist motions hand motions finger motions anything to break the static positioning and to get the blood flowing to the muscles you want to make sure that you are not in one position for too long now these regularly scheduled breaks these are very short breaks i call them micro breaks so they might only last 30 seconds and after you have say you performed your neck motions you want to perform these motions very slowly in a controlled manner and never never perform any motion that elicits symptoms or intensifies symptoms always make sure that you move through a pain-free range of motion but say for example you are performing neck motions where you're bending your head side to side once you have completed those motions then you sit down in proper posture and you get back to work and then you take your next schedule break which could be again 15 or 20 minutes away at the top of the hour get up walk around take a short break even if it's one minute or two minutes five minutes is even better but get up walk around get the blood flowing to all the muscles that are tight and that you haven't been using when you have been sitting down you can also perform nerve slide exercises nerve slide exercises are also known as nerve glides and neural mobilization they are not a resistance and non-exertion motion exercises that help to lessen nerve entrapment or nerve impingement these motions are very specific for each nerve they will help you to lessen the possibility of acquiring a workstation related nerve entrapment injury another key that you can use to help yourself in prevention of these types of injuries is hydration we need to drink plenty of water the human body relies on hydration drink water throughout the day just take small sips this will make you have to go to the restroom maybe once an hour once every two hours so during one of your regularly scheduled breaks get up walk to the restroom but as you are walking around or walking to the restroom and walking back from the restroom you are breaking the static positioning that you are seated so hydration has multiple uses obviously it's going to supply you with the water that you need but it's also going to force you to have to take breaks when you where you have to get up and walk around repetitive strain injuries usually have an insidious onset they are not a trauma say if you fall down or if you lift something and you feel the pain right away the insidious onset is slow and it comes on where you start to feel the symptoms a little bit and then maybe the symptoms decrease but then they come back and they're more frequent and they're more intense until they get to a point where they are constant or almost constant and the pain is intense this is very performance limiting this can lead to many different conditions if one area is not working right then another area has to take a greater workload and it just builds from there now repetitive strain injuries they are preventable and they are manageable and you can recover from a repetitive strain injury that is the reason that i went over all of the factors that i stated earlier where i spoke about the ergonomics now some people say what is ergonomics i define ergonomics as a body position or body positioning that maximizes efficiency and lessens the possibility of injury but you want to have proper ergonomics you want to make sure that you perform motions while you're at your computer workstation take frequent breaks and make sure that you hydrate these are some basic factors that are going to help to lower the possibility of acquiring a repetitive strain injury repetitive strain injuries can be nerve entrapments they can be ligament sprains they can be tendinopathies and they can also be muscle strains or they can be a combination of those factors when we are performing repetitive motions a muscle strength and balance occurs and the opposing muscles are the motions that we are doing they become overpowered and weak and this can lead to an injury in the muscles that are not being used in the muscles that are overpowered inhibited and weak or the muscles that are be being repetitively used so that is why it's very important to make sure that you take frequently scheduled breaks and you move these joints and you move these muscles and you keep blood flowing to all of the muscles especially the antagonistic muscles of the muscles that are frequently being used when we are mousing and when we are keyboarding repetitive strain injuries can be painful and performance limiting so do everything you can to prevent these injuries and do everything you can to recover from these entries you want to use proper ergonomics like i stated before you want to make sure that you do motions and take frequently scheduled breaks while you're doing computer work and you obviously want to hydrate these four simple things are just some very fundamental keys to helping to prevent these types of injuries thank you for viewing today's episode of dr ozello sports medicine report i am dr donald rozello of championship chiropractic in las vegas nevada i am the author of

        "video_title": "AC Joint Pain Exercises for Shoulder Rehab",
        "video_sub_title": "if you've got AC joint pain you've got to be doing these three exercises immediately to finally get your shoulder healthy yo what's up it's Coach E here from precision movement and today we are going to go through three exercises to help you fix up your AC joint pain okay so AC joint is the acromioclavicular joint and it's right about the top bony part of your shoulder most people can touch it pretty easily it's the top most pint bony portion aspect of the shoulder okay it's a little prominence there and it's the acromion comes out of the scapula kind of wraps around the top of the torso top of the ribcage and points to the front and then the clavicle is the collarbone and that joint is where those two bones interface okay now this joint unlike most joints in the body this is only held together by ligaments so if you've got an AC joint problem that indicates some type of ligament sprain or ligament laxity some problem issue with the ligaments okay the thing with ligaments is they don't heal as quickly as muscles a muscle strain really minor muscle strain it could be healed up in maybe 3 days 1 to 3 days whereas a really minor ligament sprain can take up to two weeks up to even or even longer to fully heal ok so when we sprain our ligaments we've got to be aware of that fact and we've got to progress a little bit slower ok so AC joint pain is often mistaken for symptoms of shoulder impingement so to differentiate AC joint pain and shoulder impingement I've got another video with four tests that you could take to figure out which is which one that you might have so we'll link to that on this video here so if you're not quite sure click over to that video check it out and if you do have AC joint pain come on back and we'll try to fix it up now if you just sprained your ligament your AC joint and you're working out or you're playing sports you're wrestling with your buddies I don't know what you're doing but if you just sprained it it's really important that you let it properly heal at first okay so that means no movements in the extreme ranges of motion overhead across the body and behind you okay so shoulder flexion horizontal adduction and extension respectively okay we want to minimize end range of motion in those movements because any end range of motion in those movements can potentially stretch out the ligaments of the AC joints a little bit more prolonging your healing time okay so keep it neutral we're gonna stay in front so 90 degrees of shoulder flexion and arms by the side today all right now if you do suspect you've got a sprained AC joint there's different grades I've got an article on the precision movement site that breaks down what to do and in the acute phase if you've gotten it ac joints brain so check that out if you're in that situation otherwise let's get to the exercises alright so like I said we want to stay up to 90 degrees of shoulder flexion or arms by the side and what we're trying to do is we're not doing anything with the ligaments right now we're trying to actually rest the ligaments so they can heal and do their things so it's important to get a little bit of movement go in just to facilitate blood flow and to speed up healing that way but we want what we're trying to do is improve our motor control and our stability of the scapula and of the shoulder itself okay because if we're doing movements that is putting the AC joint at risk because of other weakness poor firing patterns or just dysfunctional movement then we're never going to be able to heal from AC joint pain fully okay so we're trying to re-educate the neuromuscular system here now it's really important to avoid the one movement that is really important to avoid is downward rotate or anterior tilt of the scapula okay so when the scapula anteriorly tilts it looks like this the shoulder rolls rolls this way and that puts a ton of strain on the AC joint and how do I know I sprained my AC joint last year doing a lot of muscle ups and where that happened was right in this position when you're transitioning between the dip and the chin up okay I got overzealous and I just started working them too often and then I sprained my AC joint there so I understand what it feels like now that being said that's the movement you want to avoid which is downward rotation so how do we avoid that movement it's not just about passive flexibility some might say oh you got a stretch and that's gonna fix all your problems what it's really about is control okay we've got to build the strength and the control the patterns to be able to extend the shoulder so a shoulder extension without anteriorly tilting the scapula okay so what that takes is stability in through the torso and stability of the scapula in particular the scapular muscles that keep the scapula glued to the rib cage the most important one being the serratus anterior so we're trading that muscle to keep the scapula in position as the shoulder or the arm moves around wherever it's got to go okay so the exercise that we're going to do today are gonna help you do exactly that the first exercise I call the shoulder rotation robot I've got another video tutorial here on YouTube with this exercise but we'll break it down here looks kind of fun once you get the details you'll understand why it's so important for you okay so you're gonna start in this position one arm up one arm down and this is training something called reciprocal movement where one side of the body is moving one way and the other side of the body is moving the off okay and it's very helpful for because that's a very natural movement pattern that we use in everyday life walking for example that's reciprocal movement okay so what we're doing here is we get on the wall feet are about a foot away from the wall or so okay head such the wall good alignment and I want to think of posteriorly tilting the scapula so pulling the bottom edge of the scapula down in towards my chest okay so I pull the scapula and that activates the serratus anterior and I hold that position the whole time as I do the robot so the robot they busting out the robot at a party you know how it goes yeah but I'm maintaining that scapular position as I'm rotating or cycling through the robot now what I'm doing in this position is I'm constantly trying to drive my hand towards a wall so external rotation here and then same over here drive the hand towards a wall internal rotation here so I'm strongly trying to do this hold for five seconds hold for five seconds the whole time the scapula stays still I'm not losing it like that okay scapula stays in position stabilized working the internal and external rotators and that's training that movement pattern to keep the scapula in position to avoid downward rotation while we're moving the arms around in this case internal and external rotation okay so that's the first exercise you can do like five reps five second hold up and down alright the next one behind the back external rotation so you need a some kind of resistance band I've got one of those loop strength bands here okay a red one pretty skinny you don't need much and what you're going to do in turn you're gonna grab the band behind your back okay a little bit of tension to start hands are about butt width apart and first get in alignment good alignment okay scapula are flush against the ribcage but I'm not hyper extending my spine okay keeping neutral spine the whole time as I tilt that scapula and from here all I'm gonna do externally rotate and abduct a little bit and just hold it for 10 seconds breathe stay in good alignment and slowly release okay so again you're starting thumbs are facing each other and then the thumbs would be pointing forward holding for 10 seconds avoiding hyper extending or hyper retracting the scapula a slight abduction and external rotation force 10 second holds and we're good okay this one you want to do anywhere from three to five reps holding for ten seconds and that's gonna again help to reposition the scapula and help start to get into this shoulder extended position okay with out downwardly rotating the shoulders and anteriorly tilting the scapula okay last exercise you might have seen this one before the scap push up there's a bunch of different variations and I've got another video on YouTube with a bunch of variations of scapular push-ups so progressing you right from very deconditioned and low level up to higher level and good function okay so check out that video I'm going to link to it but the scapular push-up I'll show you the basic version here on the floor four-point position this is one of the regressions okay the important point with the scapular push-up is to just move the scapula without hyperextending or flexing the spine so here I'm retracting the scapula and I'm thinking posterior tilt again so fire up that serratus anterior I'm able to breathe okay I'm not excessively tense anywhere else and as I drive through the floor I'm sure that I'm not hyper flexing my spine okay I want to maintain neutral spine as I push and protract the scapula hold it keep driving through the floor and then you retract under control now the range of motion isn't huge here and it's not supposed to be yeah we don't have a ton of protraction and retraction when we're in neutral and that's totally cool all we're doing here our main goal is to fire up the serratus and to start to groove this good movement pattern where we've got neutral spine with strong stable scapula okay so this one you can do around five reps five to ten second holds at the top okay and moving under control very slow tempo okay so those are the three exercises for AC joint pain that's going to help to keep the shoulders moving and start to re-educate the neuromuscular system for proper aligned movement because when we're moving in alignment with the proper activation and movement patterns that's going to set us up for a lifetime of being able to do things that we love whether it's lifting in the gym playing sports in a golf ball around whatever it is you love to do these are the keys that are going to help you keep doing those things all right so if you'd like to learn more about the shoulders how they're supposed to function and specifically about the serratus anterior click the link at the end of this video to watch a little presentation I put together on the scapula and proper movement of the scapula to set you up for a movement longevity alright so thanks again my name is Eric Wong from precision movement make sure you subscribe to this channel to get the latest videos and I'll next time peace",

        "video_title": "Cervical Spondylosis Stretches & Exercises - Ask Doctor Jo",
        "video_sub_title": "Hey everybody, it's Doctor Jo, and today I'm gonna show you some stretches and exercises for cervical spondylosis. Let's get started. Special disclaimer alert. Like always, get a proper diagnosis, but especially for your neck. There can be a lot of stuff going on. Make sure you get the right diagnosis first cause some of these movements we're doing, the stretches and exercises might be contraindicative for certain diagnoses so make sure you get that right diagnosis before you start any of these. So spondylosis is just a fancy term for age related wear and tear, degeneration in the spine. So it doesn't sound fun and a lot of times it's not fun. It just kind of makes it achey, sore, sometimes stiff. Especially in the cervical area. So getting some motion, stretching everything out, usually makes it feel a little bit better. So let's start off with just some simple range of motion exercises where you're gonna start off by turning your head over, almost like you're looking over your shoulder. But try and keep your head upright. So you're not coming down like this. You're just turning straight over, looking the other way, hold it for about 10 or 15 seconds, come back nice and smooth the other way. Same thing just holding it, getting that nice stretch in there. You want to be comfortable, you don't want it to be painful. And then go back and forth about 5 times. The next one is gonna be a side bending with your head. So you're gonna go over, but you want to take your ear to your shoulder. You don't want to take your shoulder to your ear. So you don't want to hunch up like that. Keep your shoulders nice and relaxed and then just come straight over. So again, it's this movement, not this movement coming over. So bending over, trying to touch that ear to that shoulder. Hold it about 10 - 15 seconds and then come back up the other way. You can probably see a little difference there, and then again do 5 on each side. Then you're gonna do a flexion extension. So just coming down bringing the chin towards the chest, holding it there again 10 - 15 seconds. And then come back up looking at the ceiling 10 - 15 seconds. Now if you have any kind of dizziness issues, be very careful about coming up looking at the ceiling. So maybe not coming up quite as high until you make sure you don't get dizzy when you do that. And again 5 times, 10 - 15 seconds. Now going in to some exercising, we're going to do the isometric movements. Which is you're making the movement, but you're preventing yourself from moving. You're pushing in to your hand that you have there. So again, we're gonna go back to that rotation, side-to-side, but this time just place your hand on your temple and gently push in to it. So your head's not really moving, but you're giving it just a little bit of pressure activating those muscles. Hold it for 3 - 5 seconds. Switch sides. And then again, do 5 on each side. With the head bending, then same thing. So now you're gonna push down that way, so it's gonna be that movement. Pushing in and coming back. And the same thing on the other side. Just doing that movement, but not really going anywhere. And then coming down towards your chest, just place your palm on your forehead and then push inwards. Holding it for that 3 - 5 seconds, and then placing your hand on the back of your head and pushing like you're going up that way. 3 - 5 seconds. Now you're gonna do some more stretches, You're gonna go in to stretching those trapezius muscles which are the ones ion the back that kind of hold that neck area in to place. So those are the big ones. There's a lot of little ones in the inside and then there's the big ones on the outside. So to stretch your trap, sometimes you can just push your hand down, I like sitting on it cause it holds that shoulder into place so you can get more of a stretch. And then just take your hand, kind of hold it on the opposite side, and gently pull over to the side. Holding that stretch for about 30 seconds. Now, again, try and keep your head in that alignment going this way, not turning your head this way or that way, and just pulling over. So again, doing that for 30 seconds, switch sides. And then do that 3 times on each side. Then the last stretch is gonna be the levator scapula stretch, which is that mean one in the back that a lot of time gives you that trigger point right there. A lot of times you can just press and go 'oh, that's the spot.' And the reason those are usually so sore is because when you're stressed you kind of hold your shoulders up like this. And those levator are the ones that elevate the scapula back there. So a lot of times if you're like this, it ends up over working those muscles. The way to stretch these muscles in an interesting way. So the side you want to stretch, you're gonna take that hand and just kind of put it on the back of your shoulder where that scapula is. So your elbow is kind of either going straight up if you have a lot of flexibility there, or just up at about a 45 degree angle. Take your other hand and put on the back of your head, up and back. And you're gonna go down at an angle like you're looking at your opposite knee. So not straight forward, not all the way out to the side like the trap, but at that 45 degree angle. So coming over like that and try and keep that other side up as high as you can. You should feel a little stretch through there. And the more you pull, the more of a stretch you'll get. So again, holding that for about 30 seconds, and then do 3 on each side. So then switch sides, over towards the other knee, and then holding it there. There you have it, those were your stretches and exercises for cervical spondylosis. If you have any questions, leave them in the comments section.

Go to Twitter, Instagram, or Tik Tok if you want a 60 second version of our program where we don't ramble. - And we do have podcast now. - Where we do ramble. - We do. - We have great guests. - But with our guests, though. They're very intelligent, well-versed. - Unlike us. - Yeah, so this is our gift to you this week, is we're gonna be giving away a SleepOvation mattress. - A giveaway mattress? - 700 individual mattresses. - 700! - Yup, and it's got air channels. And this is just a sample of one, by the way. You can get whatever size you want. - It's really comfortable. - If you have back pain or neck pain, this is your baby. - Yeah, we both have 'em, we've had 'em for years and very, very excited about using them every night we go to bed. - Yeah, yeah. - (chuckles) Well anyways, I sleep very well. So anyways, back spasms, Bob, we wanna get rid of those. And the last thing I wanna do, and a lot of the patients I've had, is take muscle relaxers. - Right. - They do relax the muscles, but they get you tired. - Sleepy. - Yeah, the side effects are not desirable. - My mom just had a fall. - Oh really? - I didn't wanna put her on any of that because she could fall again. - Right. - Because she's just sleepy. - Tired, and you're just not all there. So these spasms are muscles that are contracting. Yeah, they're trying to protect the back. They're tightening up so don't put the back into a bad position. - Right, and it's the natural occurring thing. You really can't do anything about it, but what happens, these muscles contract, they get tight like an isometric. If you hold a muscle in a isometric, then it starts to become fatigued. A lot of lactic acid build up in that area and that results in pain, so chronic spasms, it's not comfortable, it becomes painful. We need to relax the muscle, get fresh blood flow in there and allow relief. So that's the option. - Well, and I think your first suggestion is right, is that you wanna put it in good posture, right Brad? - Right, we're gonna use some heat. Now, we want some heat on these tight muscles to relax them. But oftentimes, the problem, the muscle's tight because of poor posture could be the only reason. Not always, but it can be, or part of it. So posture, posture, posture, get it right. And you know, 'cause it'll feel better when you get that. We're gonna show you three different options. - So posture with heat as well is what we're gonna do. - Yes! That's what I meant to say. I'm glad you're here to clarify it so that people know what I'm trying to say. - No, this is funny. Again my mom, after her fall, this is the first thing I got her, Brad. - What's that, a hot pack? - No, a Thermotex. - It is a hot pack! - Well, it's a far infrared heating system. Way better than a hot pack because it penetrates deep. And she had a rib injury, so I wasn't worried because I knew this penetrates, how many inches? - 2.36 inches. - Yeah, 2.36 inches, so it goes deep down. Regular heat only goes basically skin deep. - Skin deep. - Few millimeters. - So this thing was the solution for her. It was able to heat up the area and she was able to get some relief. - Now, if you have a regular standard one, you can use that. - Try that, absolutely. - You don't have to use this. You'll still have success, this is better. - These are pricey and they're an investment, basically. - Right, so that's the options there. But if you're gonna do this in a seated position, which is an option and I do use this option. I use this in my recliner. - Yeah, and same as me. - One thing I do. Now, my recliners kinda firm 'cause I bought it that way, but I do use my cushion or my heat pad. I'll put that there and that actually helps my posture and acts as a lumbar support, and I'll sit like that. And I just did this yesterday, as a matter of fact. Turn it on and it just felt good, the posture felt good. I was relaxed, going that direction already. And the heat just took that, my muscles. - Second thing with the far infrared, it's not an intense heat. - No, it's not. - It's kind of a mild heat that goes deep. - Right. It does take a little longer to get in deep. They recommend up to 45 minutes, which is not a problem because you're feeling so good. - Just sitting there. - Right. If you're using conventional hot pack, once you get past 20 minutes, it's not gonna go any deeper. - Now Brad, when I use mine, I do put a pillow behind it. - Yeah, that's a good point. - My chair doesn't have enough support, so I put the pillow behind it and it gives me a little lumbar support and put me in that good posture. - And you'll know, 'cause if it's too big of a pillow, it'll feel like a big bump. Like right now, this is a big bump for me. - If you're using a regular hot pack, don't fall asleep with it because you could get burned. - That's a possibility, yeah. 'Cause they are three different heat settings and if you put it on high right away. - Yeah. Harder to get burned with a far infrared, but I still don't want you falling asleep with it. - Yeah, it's best just to set a timer with your phone. Now, let's go to the prone position or you can do this lying down and put the hot pack. You wanna, okay. - Go ahead, Bob. But you're gonna give me a pillow? - Yep, and we're gonna talk about the use of a pillow. Now, if you're lying down, chances are you're gonna find and you've got a spasm in your low back, particularly if you put a pillow underneath. It might go this way or the other way may be better, but you can experiment. Oftentimes, that's gonna feel better. - A little more comfortable. - On your back. - Right, and at that point, put this on and you can just relax there for your 45 minutes. Now, don't fall asleep, again, here because you may get a neck ache if your head's turned one way. So when you're doing this, just make sure you turn your head right to left every few minutes or so. And some people, you can go straight down, like Bob has his hands like that. - Yeah, you can even put a rolled towel here and put your head straight. - Should we talk about if you wanna lie down on your back? - Sure. - To get rid of those muscle knots. - It's right behind you, Brad. - Oh yeah, yeah, so you can do two things. If you're gonna lie on your back, we suggest putting your feet, we use a leg wedge. It's probably the best thing we've used. - Ah, that feels so good. - It does. All the sudden, just doing that on a healthy person. - It feels good. - It feels relaxing. There's something about this angle, and then it makes contact with your hamstrings and we don't completely understand it. We just know it works for some reason. - Yeah, 'cause for some reason if I go like this, it's not as comfortable. It's that full contact all the way along the sides of the block. - Right, now, you don't have to buy these. You can take some pillows and put 'em in there. It doesn't work as good, but it's still a lot better than lying flat. And then, once you find that relaxed position, you've got enough pillows, then you put that hot pack underneath or cold pack, you can use one. - On spasms, you could use a cold pack. - Sure, yep. And you're gonna lie there for 20 minutes or so. You can go a little bit longer. I've used this, I use heat or cold. It all depends on my circumstances. But anyways, it's a wonderful cure, not cure, but it really-- - Helps you get to sleep. - Calms my back down, exactly right. So that's the heat and we mentioned, you could try cold as well. Now, the second thing to get rid of tight muscles. - A spasm. - Spasm, and this a little faster, typically. And it is direct muscle mobilization or a massage. If you don't have a professional masseuse at home that's gonna take care of 'em for ya, we're gonna show you the other options. If you have knots in your upper back, this is what I like to do. Matter of fact, we did a video on this not too long ago. - This might be more for knots and not as much spasms. If it's spasm, I don't know if you're gonna be able to tolerate this or not, you might be able to. - Yeah, and it's going to depend. Now, this is not a real hard roll, it's a medium density so it's not as aggressive on those knots. - Six inch or more. - Yep, and so I'm just gonna roll. Now, you wouldn't do this on a mat like this. You'd do it on the floor, but for demonstration purposes. And sometimes people like to cross their arms like this to get their scapulas or the shoulder blades out of the way. And you can really get into that mid back then. - Now if this is too aggressive, and it might be, like Bob had mentioned. - It might be. - We didn't mention that you could use a hot pack on the thoracic spine as well, using the same rules. - And you could use a ball like this, too. - Yup, now that's a lacrosse ball. - That's a lacrosse ball. - That's pretty aggressive. - That's pretty aggressive, yeah. - You might wanna start with a tennis ball. - Or against the wall. - Yeah. - But you basically, I'm gonna hit some spots. Brad, you mind coming over just so I can show where we're trying to hit? - Oh, sure. - Usually we hit between the spine and between the shoulder blade, right in here, different spots on both sides. And by rolling onto that area, it helps mobilize. And again, you have to determine if you can tolerate that if you have spasms. - Right. - You certainly can try with trigger points. - You can do it like this, this is what Bob was saying. You can do it on the wall and it's not as aggressive. And once you get to that spasm, you wanna work it slowly and as you get relaxed, you can get more and more onto it and get more aggressive, and you'll feel it release. And when it releases, it just feels good. You know things are going well. - In the right right direction. - Right, the next thing, and these massage guns are out. If you happen to have a massage gun, I'm gonna show you how to use it, particularly on your low back with Bob. We've just discovered this recently, how well this works. But you do have to use the right head and it's hard to do to yourself. You almost have to do this with someone else assisting, so we'll give you a little instruction on how to do it. So here, Bob is lying here. Now, because we wanna make Bob as comfortable as possible, let's put a pillow right between the knees there. That's gonna help relax everything. You want a pillow under your head, Bob? - Sure! - There ya go. - That's it, so he's got low back pain. Let's see the spasm, and typically you won't have wire from a mic on a person at home. The spasm can be, I got cold fingers, Bob, you see that? - That's all right. (chuckles) - I'm giving you a spasm just touching with those cold fingers. We're gonna get into that muscle right there. Let's say the spasm is right there. We're gonna use this massage gun with the pointy head, but you gotta be careful. You do not wanna massage on the bone or the spine, 'cause that's gonna hurt. Start on a low speed. These guns have five different speeds. We're gonna start on level two right here. And I'm not gonna go straight in right away. I'm gonna come in at an angle, and there's a quadratus lumborum muscle in there that oftentimes could be a spasm muscle. And I'm gonna get in there, and then Bob, he's going to tell me how it feels. Is that okay, Bob? - That feels good. - Okay, it's not too aggressive? - No. - Okay, if you want me to go a little more aggressive, push harder, let me know. So as the person giving the massage with the massage gun, you have to listen to the feedback of the person getting the massage. - [Bob] So he's basically going around the lumbar paraspinals there. You wanna show where those are, Brad? - Yeah, see this muscle group right here, this massive muscle bulge. (talking over each other) - [Bob] He's going underneath that, basically, to try to get to the QL, the quadratus lumborum. - I could go on it like this. - Yeah, go onto it. - Is that getting too aggressive? - [Bob] No, no, that's fine. - So it just makes sure you don't get down on those spinous process, those bumps, those bony prominences on the back. - [Bob] And you can't go too far up here 'cause you hit the ribs. - Yeah, you get up and that 12th rib, there's a floating rib that's kind of sensitive. And then you get up in there and you don't wanna get in. The main muscle groups that are spasming are typically in this area. Now can you see, Tanner, that the skin's getting a little red? If you zoom in on that, it's not real red but you'll see it. What's going on when you see the skin getting red, that's okay, that's actually meaning there's some-- - Blood flow. - The blood supply blood flow is going to the area, which is a good sign. Obviously, if there's any skin irritations or rashes or anything that, this is not an option. The other option I should mention, excuse me, Bob. Usually these guns, our guns come with a number of different heads. This air cushion head may be an option that might work out well. We've just found to get in deep into those muscles, this one works well if it's used properly, the way I demonstrated. Bob, I'm done, I'm not gonna do any more massages on ya. - I was enjoying myself. - I know, but I had to draw the line. - I gotta wake up. - So anyways, good luck with those spasms. You can get rid of them without taking the medications. Just one of those options are definitely, I think it'll work, if not maybe two or three. - Check it out. - That's right. (bright music)",

        "video_title": "Homocysteine, how to lower it, and still eat meat",
        "video_sub_title": "hi my name's Lewis Carroll I'm here to talk to you today about homocysteine which is an amino acid that is a bit toxic in the body actually it's a lot toxic in the body it's not something that you want in there homocysteine is it damages the endothelial cells in your arteries and can lead to a buildup of plaque it's been linked to DNA damage it's linked to Alzheimer's it's linked to heart attacks there are people out there that actually have low levels of cholesterol their cholesterol readings are okay under 200 and yet they're still prone to heart attacks where they've already had some heart attacks at a fairly young age whole Assisting levels are probably high what you want to do is keep this rascal at I suppose about 7 micro moles per liter that would be the concentration but you know you get up around 30 or 40 or 50 you can start having heart attacks even though your cholesterol levels might not be that high there are doctors out there that recommend that you lower homocysteine levels which is correct but the method that they're recommending doesn't seem correct to me in other words they're recommending that you get off a meat homocysteine comes from Metheny the thionyl is an amino acid that is abundant in meat and the thigh name is great I mean you need both I mean it makes creatine in the body it supplies sulphur it creates s-adenosylmethionine also known as Sam II it improves immune function it improves the absorption of zinc and selenium in your body the finding converts estrodial into the weaker estriol it's considered a weaker and a safer form of estrogen prevents premature ejaculation you can thank Matheny in for that reduces inflammation it chelate son eliminates heavy metals it can even help with depression so the finding is a is a great thing to have but the problem is the finding is converted to many other things in the body so that you can carry on your main but as it transitions through these various forms to get to the ultimate thing that your body wants it's going to make some homocysteine homocysteine levels as it rise up in the body is associated with heart disease and these other bad things heart attacks and things of that nature so you want to lower homocysteine levels there are different ways to do it some of the B vitamins such as vitamin b6 b12 and folate can be used b6 isn't all that strong but but it can be used and basically what b6 is going to do is it converts homocysteine into something called Saito fining and ultimately cysteine and ammonia which ammonia you can breathe it out vitamin b12 if you wanted to supplement some of that that comes that actually comes from bacteria in the gut and it can help to convert homocysteine back into methionine so you're basically recycling it to get to get a little whole cysteine levels lower and the finding back up folate is actually been shown to be pretty effective if you were to take a thousand micrograms per day as the as a supplement you can get extra folate folate does the same thing it converts a whole assisting back into the fighting or to seek more fiber because eating lots and lots of fiber actually changes the culture of bacteria in your intestines and you end up more of a good with more of a good kind of bacteria that creates more fully and you can get rid of homocysteine levels that way that's why some people say that a high fiber diet is actually heart-healthy and that's one of the reasons you're going to create more folate and I'm going to bring down homocysteine levels there is another way to do it and it's probably this has got me my favorite way Ashley and it's n-acetylcysteine cysteine is an amino acid that you can find in foods but it's not very plentiful it's fairly unstable it's kind of destroyed with the cooking process and I think it's living factor in producing glutathione an acetylcysteine lowers homocysteine levels by converting it into glutathione and glutathione is great you know you want more of that in the body if you can get it it's it's wonderful stuff it's considered the master antioxidant in every cell in your body it boosts your immune system it's a detoxifier it suppresses inflammation in the body it's a transporter of amino acids it helps to regulate the body's response to injury it activates enzymes in the body it strengthens synthesis and repair of DNA and it steers the direction of synthesis of proteins so it's wonderful stuff you want more glue define if you can get it this advice that the medical community sometimes gives where they want you to cut back on meats in order to lower homocysteine levels I think is the wrong way to go personally I'm a meat-eater round a carnivore I like me you know meats great not necessarily a lot of red meat because for some people it actually will increase your symptoms of arthritis but there's all those other meats you know this white meat so it's true Gators chicken the shrimp if you can get it without that mercury fish you know that type of thing meats are good and needs have a lot of protein them but instead of dropping out meats out of your diet in order to lower homocysteine levels and avoid heart attacks and plaque and things like that why not continue to eat meats to get the the methionine which is good for you and simply take the Co most existing and convert it into glutathione I think that's just a better way to go that way you get to meet you give them you get everything that's good for you and you can still avoid high levels of homocysteine homocysteine like I say can be dropped down with those B vitamins b6 b12 and folate but that doesn't always work for every person if your homocysteine levels are high and you take B vitamins and you can't get below say 25 micromoles per liter then you got to do something else and that something else would be an acetylcysteine generally an acetal cyst is generally actually an acetylcysteine has been shown to almost cut homocysteine levels in half just by itself and at the same time raise glutathione levels and that's just a wonderful way to go so you can eat your meat and get more glutathione levels and stay healthier and I think I think that's a great way to go the other thing is is I'm not too far away from Loma Linda and it's considered that whole area in Southern California is has a lot of seventh-day adventists people there and they live quite long lives you know they're doing pretty well they'll live in their 90's maybe under hundreds and they avoid meat well they don't seem to have a high incidence of heart attacks as compared with meat eaters but let's understand the reason why if you're not eating meats you're going to reduce methane levels which is going to also reduce homocysteine levels which is going to help you to last longer your vascular system is going to stay healthier by not eating those needs but there's a way to eat meat and still live a long time what we got to do is understand the mechanism that's in place and that is homocysteine so you can still eat your meat but take your B vitamins or take Brewery so it's loaded B vitamins no take your B value mints and take some acetylcysteine to lower homocysteine levels and that way you can sort of have your cake and eat it too you can have your meats and still not have these these heart issues and I think that's the form or program",

        "video_title": "How To Read Your Thyroid Panel Results",
        "video_sub_title": "hey I'm dr. Eric o sanski and in this video I'm gonna discuss some thyroid panel basics and I will show some actual patient reports so that you can better understand your thyroid blood test results before I begin I just want to remind you that the main reason I put together these videos is to help people with different types of autoimmune conditions and other health issues better understand that test results so that they can find and remove their triggers correct any underlying imbalances and feel great again there are three main markers I'm going to focus on in this video this includes thyroid stimulating hormone or TSH and this is a pituitary hormone that affects the secretion of the thyroid hormones thyroxine also known as t4 is a type of thyroid hormone approximately 85% of thyroid hormone released by the thyroid gland is t4 with approximately 15% being t3 when looking at total t4 you need to keep in mind that most of the t4 is protein bounds in other words most of the t4 produced by the thyroid gland binds to a protein which is then transported around the bloodstream free t4 represents a free form of thyroxine in the blood and is what I'll be focusing on when discussing the reference ranges and looking at the reports we also have triiodothyronine which is t3 so it just as is the case with total t4 with total t3 you'll have most of the t3 bound to a protein and a small percentage of the hormone is free and therefore can bind to the thyroid hormone receptors as for the thyroid antibodies I'll dedicate separate videos to each of these and there will also be a separate video on reverse t3 so that you can better understand these three markers I like to discuss the difference between hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism so with overt hypothyroidism you will have an elevated TSH along with a low t3 and t4 with hyperthyroidism you will have a depressed TSH along with high T 3 and T 4 levels many people with Hashimoto's thyroiditis have subclinical hypothyroidism where they have an elevated CSH but both of their thyroid hormone levels are within the normal reference range although they might be less than optimal and with subclinical hyperthyroidism you will have a suppressed TSH with a normal t3 and t4 as for the lab versus optimal range while it's great to see your numbers fall within the laboratory range you don't want the numbers to be in the high or low side even if they are within the lab range and so there is an optimal range for each of these markers which I'll discuss next so let's take a look at the reference ranges for the three different markers according to lab Cora the reference range for a TSH is 0.5 zero to four point five zero international units per milliliter and the reference range as you can see here is very similar with quest Diagnostics as they have 0.4 zero it's a four point five zero international units per milliliter but the optimal reference range should be between one and two I use per milliliter and so for example if someone has a TSH of 3.5 this will be within a lab reference range of most labs but it will be outside of the optimal range and many people will experience hypothyroid symptoms when the TSH is that high let's discuss the reference range for the free t4 so according to lab Cora the reference range is point a two to one point seven seven nanograms per deciliter quest Diagnostics it has a reference range of zero point eight to one point eight nanograms per deciliter and the optimal reference range should be 1 point 1 to 1.5 and let's look at the reference range for the free t3 so our grunts a lab core the reference range is two point zero to four point four Piko grams per milliliter and quest diagnostics has a reference range of free t3 of two point three it's a four point two pike grams per milliliter and then the optimal reference range should be three to three point seven so let's take a look at some patient reports and of course the patient's names are not on the reports do the patient confidentiality but here we see an example where the TSH is clearly elevated five point four zero nine I use per milliliter free t4 is within a lab range but you could see the it's less than optimal and then free t3 is also within the lab range but like the free t4 it's less than optimal and here we see some other markers now what's interesting here as TSH is looking pretty good at one point six seven zero but the free t4 is depressed it's out of range zero point seven zero and then the free t3 is also low at one point eight and there's some other markers this person is also low in ferritin and but also add vitamin D tested and we'll discuss antibodies in a separate video but you can see here that the anti TPO antibodies which are the anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies are elevated and here's another report so this one is more closely associated with hyperthyroidism as you see a depressed TSH and sometimes it shows up as being even lower than this a lot of times they'll be undetectable like less than point zero zero one but here we see the free t3 is elevated we see nine point three and this lab is using reference range of two to four point four and free t4 three point zero six so again it's elevated really with any any lab that uses the same units of measurements both of these values will be elevated and this is just that word panel from a different country I forget what country it's from but we see the TSH is actually looking pretty good here one point four and they use a range of point three to four point two but again as I mentioned you also need to look at the optimal range so if this was let's say three point zero would still would be within this range but would be outside of the optimal range and then we see free t3 three point seven so on the lower side of this range which is three point one two six point eight Piko moles per liter and then free t4 16 which is within range here and here we pretty much see a full thyroid panel so we see we see the total t3 and then we see the total t4 so total t3 is within range total t4 also within range but on a lower end of the range at five point one free t3 is looking pretty good at 3.6 free t4 looking okay at 1.0 maybe a little bit higher it's on the lower ends of this range but optimally we'd want to see it let's say about one point one but even one is not bad TSH is just the optimal range I gave between one and two so this is just under that not too bad and we'll discuss antibodies and reverse t3 on a different video but we see here that both antibodies the anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies and inside our globulin antibodies are elevated we'll also be looking at thyroid stimulating immunoglobulins on a different video which are the antibodies associate Graves disease if you want to learn about some of the other important blood sets you should consider getting I would check out the video that just appeared on your screen if you

THE FIRST M STANDS FOR DISEASE THAT WAS ONCE SO COMMON ALMOST ALL CHILDREN IN THE UNITED STATES WERE INFECTED BY THE TIME THEY WERE 10 YEARS OLD. MEASLES IS A VIRUS THAT CAUSES A RASH THAT USUALLY STARTS ON THE FACE AND THEN SPREADS TO THE REST OF THE BODY. MOST CHILDREN WHO ARE INFECTED RECOVER FULLY. BUT BEFORE THE MEASLES VACCINE, THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN CHILDREN DIED EACH YEAR FROM MEASLES. THEY DIED BECAUSE MEASLES INFECTED THE BRAIN, OR THEY DIED BECAUSE IT INFECTED THEIR LUNGS. NOW, ABOUT 9 OUT OF EVERY 10 CHILDREN IN THE UNITED STATES ARE IMMUNIZED. AND THE INCIDENCE OF MEASLES INFECTIONS HAS FALLEN DRAMATICALLY. BUT BECAUSE THE MEASLES EPIDEMICS HAVE OCCURRED IN THE U.S. AS RECENTLY AS 1991, WE STILL NEED TO KEEP OUR GUARD UP. THE SECOND M IN THE MMR VACCINE STANDS FOR DISEASE THAT CAUSED CHILDREN TO HAVE SWELLING OF THEIR CHEEKS THAT MADE THEM LOOK LIKE LITTLE CHIPMUNKS. MUMPS IS ALSO CAUSED BY A VIRUS. THIS VIRUS USUALLY INFECTS THE GLANDS LOCATED JUST IN FRONT OF THE EAR. THESE ARE CALLED THE PAROTID GLANDS. MOST CHILDREN SURVIVE MUMPS INFECTION WITHOUT ANY DIFFICULTIES. BUT INFECTION WITH MUMPS ISN'T ALWAYS SO MILD. THAT'S BECAUSE THE MUMPS VIRUS CAN ALSO INFECT THE BRAIN AND CAUSE MENINGITIS AND DEAFNESS. IN FACT, MUMPS INFECTIONS WERE ONE OF THE MOST COMMON CAUSES OF DEAFNESS IN THE U.S. NOW, BECAUSE OF THE MUMPS VACCINE, THE INFECTIONS CAUSED BY MUMPS VIRUS HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED. BUT MUMPS ISN'T GONE. EVERY YEAR CASES OF MUMPS STILL OCCUR IN THE U.S. THE R IN THE MMR STANDS FOR A VIRAL INFECTION THAT WAS ONCE A VERY COMMON CAUSE OF SEVERE BIRTH DEFECTS. RUBELLA IS A VIRUS THAT TYPICALLY INFECTS CHILDREN, CAUSING A VERY MILD ILLNESS WITH RASH, LOW-GRADE FEVER, AND SWELLING OF THE GLANDS BEHIND THE EAR. CHILDREN VIRTUALLY ALWAYS RECOVER FROM RUBELLA WITHOUT ANY LONG-TERM PROBLEMS. BUT WHEN RUBELLA INFECTS PREGNANT WOMEN, THE RESULTS ARE USUALLY CATASTROPHIC. MOST PREGNANT WOMEN INFECTED WITH RUBELLA EARLY IN THEIR PREGNANCY EITHER MISCARRY OR DELIVER BABIES THAT ARE BLIND, DEAF, OR HAVE HEART DEFECTS. BEFORE THE RUBELLA VACCINE WAS USED IN THE U.S., AS MANY AS 20,000 NEWBORNS EVERY YEAR WERE HARMED BY THE RUBELLA VIRUS. 20,000 CHILDREN. NOW, BECAUSE OF THE RUBELLA VACCINE, CHILDREN ARE RARELY HARMED BY THE VIRUS. THE MEASLES, MUMPS, AND RUBELLA VACCINE ARE ALL MADE THE EXACT SAME WAY AS THE CHICKEN POX VACCINE. NATURAL MEASLES, MUMPS, AND RUBELLA VIRUSES WERE FIRST ISOLATED FROM PEOPLE AND THEN WEAKENED IN THE LABORATORY.",

I'll tear it right down to the anchor point here. and from there I'm actually going to come underneath the foot. placing it so that tape is going through the middle arch area from there i might have the person turn their foot inwards just slightly there's no tension on this tape here, but when i get to the arch I'm going to start putting tension on there. I'm pulling both pieces up with pretty good tension on there, seventy five percent to a hundred-percent tension. I'm rubbing that on so that it will stay on there and if this is the area of of pain i'm going to take one other piece tearing it in the same methood and we're making those legs of the tape our tails I'm going to curl the tape off I'm actually going to place the anchor point behind the leg slightly and I like to just remove the paper backing at that point and what I'm going to do is to pull the skin towards the anchor point as I lay tht tape down with fairly good tension, maybe fifty to seventy-five percent same thing again, I'm going to be pulling the skin towards the anchor point and pulling that tape over. How does that feel? and you're ready to go",

skin gets all itchy and breaks out into hives scary or your throat starts to tickle and close scary it's different for everybody every reaction is different a mild reaction one time can be life-threatening the next so it's important to know your body know when it starts to feel funny it could be the warning signs of anaphylaxis so it's also important to know how to use one of these an epipen auto injector epipen and epipen junior are further emergency treatment of life-threatening allergic reactions and for people who are at an increased risk for these reactions epipen and epipen junior should only be used to help someone during an emergency ready to show them how it's done yeah epipen junior the one with the green label is for kids like me an epipen with the yellow label for bigger people like me so first things first you take it out of the tube just flip open the yellow cap or the green cap slide it out and hold it like this blue to the sky orange to the thigh then you take off the blue cap blue safety release never put your hands near the orange tip because that's where the needle comes out the needle is designed to go through clothing including jeans because it must be injected into the outer thigh for quick absorption if you're helping a young child like me hold the leg firmly in place once it is you just do this boom it clicks so you know it worked then you hold it there for three seconds then remove epipen you'll still see some liquid in there but don't worry here epipen junior auto injector gave you the right dose and it has a special feature the never seen needle yeah so the needle's totally covered up so you should never see the needle then rub the spot for 10 seconds while you or someone else gets emergency medical help right away close the ambulance or have someone take you to the emergency room just make sure to do it immediately and you should always carry two epipen auto injectors wherever you go they even come clipped together because some people might need the second dose remember epinephrine is the only first-line treatment for anaphylaxis not antihistamines so just trust yourself and do it don't hesitate especially if you know the symptoms of a life-threatening allergic reaction and i've practiced with the great trainer that comes in the box because this is what's important to people like me and me use epipen epinephrine injection usp 0.3 milligrams or epipen junior epinephrine injection usp 0.15 milligrams auto injectors right away when you have an allergic emergency anaphylaxis get emergency medical help right away you may need further medical attention only a health care professional should give additional doses of epinephrine if you need more than two injections for a single anaphylactic episode epipen or epipen junior should only be injected into the middle of your outer thigh upper leg through clothing if necessary do not inject into your veins buttocks fingers toes hands or feet hold the leg of young children firmly in place before enduring injection to prevent injuries in case of accidental injection please seek immediate medical treatment rarely patients who have used epipen or epipen junior may develop an infection at the injection site within a few days some of these infections can be serious call your health care professional right away if you have any of the following at an injection site redness that does not go away swelling tenderness or the area feels warm to the touch tell your healthcare professional about all of your medical conditions especially if you have

        "video_sub_title": "You have painful ear popping when you fly. My name is Beverly Bitterman. I'm an ARNP and health and wellness consultant and I'm here to give you some tips and strategies to make your flight more comfortable. The first thing you should know is that you want your ears to pop when you're on the airplane. What that does is equalizes the pressure between your inner ear and your the outside of your body. And, that's a good thing. It hurts because there's some swelling in the tube that connects your inner ear to your nose. So, what we want to do is do things that will open up that tube. Some simple things you can do are chewing gum. That's a great thing to do when you're taking off and landing. Usually, the problem is worse on landing. Although, sometimes taking off. And, other things that keep your jaw moving. You can even just move your jaw. Open your mouth really wide and you hear that crackle back there. That's a good thing that can help open up that Eustachian tube. If you've had a cold or if you are congested or have allergies or something like that, you might need to do a little bit more. Sometimes, if you're quite congested you may want to take a medication like pseudoephedrine. You buy this from the druggist. You don't need a prescription, but you do have to sign for it. I prefer the short acting variety, the thirty milligram tablet. And, I advise taking it about half an hour before you get on the plane and about every four hours after that until you've landed. That helps decrease congestion and open up that tube. If that isn't enough, you can add some nasal spray. A decongestant nasal spray. A puff in each nostril is a good way to also get to the back or the opening of that tube in the back of your nose and help open things up. If you have still a bad pain, another strategy the stewardess can help you with is to give you a cup and some hot water and you take your napkin. You put it in the bottom of the cup. You put the hot water on the napkin and then you take that and you hold it on your ear. And, that actually lets some steam some moist heat get onto your ear and it feels really good. If you're still having difficulty or you've got a child with that problem, then you might want to see your doctor. Because, they can order some drops that will help decrease pain with flying. This is Beverly Bitterman, ARNP and good travels to you.",

        "video_title": "Durable Outdoor Finish?",
        "video_sub_title": "(upbeat music) [Marc] - So you might recall this project. This is the rustic outdoor table and it looks even more rustic than it did on day one. (birds squawking) I have to say I neglected the finish on this. I think we just applied like a teak oil product and it hasn't held up well and it really needed to be applied at least yearly, but I didn't do that. We had another kid. Hey, I got a little helper today. I did actually get a chance to refinish the benches. Those held up much, much better and probably just need a new top coat at this point, but the key lesson here, outdoor finishes always require additional maintenance. It's just the way it is. It's a way of life with outdoor furniture. So we will do a little rehab on this one. It doesn't take much to remove the gray top layer and expose fresh wood fibers. Western red cedar grays really nicely overtime so if you're into that weathered look, you might not want to sand the surface like I'm doing here. (slow upbeat music) To fill all the cracks and (mumbles) I'm using West System Epoxy. Unlike regular five minute epoxy, this stuff is loose enough to pour into the small holes and cracks and it just soaks it right up. I could then use a putty knife to spread the epoxy and push it further into the cracks. Though I didn't initially intend on it, it quickly became evident that I get best results by simply coating the entire surface. Then I could just go back with an irrigation syringe and force epoxy into the deepest cracks. The ends of the bread boards were in really bad shape, so once the top surface was dry, I just tilted the table on its side and used some blue tape to hold back the epoxy and let the end grain soak up all it wanted. For the benches, I decided to completely remove the previous finish. The wood under there was in much better shape than the table. Once the epoxy was dry, I sanded it smooth with 80 grit paper. As you can see, even the base required some epoxy fills here and there. At this point, it was pretty fun posting pictures online and watching people freak out about how I ruined this table, but as you can see after some diligent sanding the top starts to look really nice. Now I can sand up to 180 grit and get ready for the one two punch finish, epoxy sealer followed by marine varnish. I'm trying a new to me epoxy sealer product called Total Boat Epoxy. Unlike similar sealers, such as CPES, this stuff has minimal odor and zero VOCs. Mixing is simple. Just use the ratio markings on the mixing cup and apply liberally to the surface. For better absorption, you can dilute with acetone. The product applies easily enough, but it didn't seem to soak into the fibers as readily as CPES and it also took a very long time to cure, like a week. Eventually, I was able to lightly sand the surface with 180 grit in preparation for the varnish. My varnish of choice is Epifanes. This stuff is super thick, so I like to dilute it with mineral spirits by about 50% for the first couple of coats and the last few coats I usually go down to 25%. You can apply this varnish like any other oil-based varnish. I like using foam brushes or natural bristle brushes. By the way, I should mention that none of these products are inexpensive. These are marine quality finishes and they're made to survive some pretty harsh conditions. It's a good investment for someone who really doesn't wanna refinish furniture every year. The tabletop was the biggest pain in the butt, primarily because I didn't wanna bring the table into the shop. So my finishing schedule was subject to the weather and yes this table did get rained on a couple of times before I wised up and covered it with a tarp. After each coat of varnish, I sand the surface with 220 grit. Towards the end, I move up to 320 grit. I apply a full five coats of gloss varnish to all parts of the project at the rate of one coat a day and in some cases only being able to apply finish to one side at a time, you could see how a project like this might take weeks. The regular Epifanes product is high gloss and I'm not really a fan of high gloss, so I'm doing two more coats of Epifanes Matt Wood Finish. Because I like to make things confusing, I pour the finish and dilute it inside an empty can of the gloss product. Now check out how well this stuff works. I apply a nice even coat and then after it dries the surface is just dead flat. I give the surface a quick hand sanding with 320, vacuum off the dust and apply a second coat of matt, which is the final coat of finish. All right, so was this a lot of work? Yes it was. It was a giant pain in my butt. It took a very long time dodging weather and just the sheer number of coats of an oil-based finish like this, it just takes a long time, but in the end, it's totally worth it because now it's a very easy to clean surface. I have no problem having the family come out here and have dinner on this thing. There's no splinters and there's sort of a secondary benefit. The fact that I let this guy sit out in the weather for so long means there were a lot of cracks and all those cracks are now filled with epoxy and it gives this surface a very unique look, one that would be difficult to replicate if you were trying to create it from fresh wood. So you know, it's kind of got that sort of earned rustic character that's difficult to replicate. But overall, I like it. It's got like splotchiness everywhere and it sort of really lives up to that sort of rustic, not so rustic thing that I was going for with the original build. All right, so I would say the lesson learned here is you should probably finish your projects properly the first time so that you don't have to do a big do over mulligan like this, but if you do, there are ways to salvage a project even when it looks like it's in really, really bad condition. All right, thanks for watching. (slow upbeat music) Well how about that. Right on cue, it's actually starting to rain so good thing I got this umbrella in place. But even if I didn't, I think that finish is gonna hold up quite nicely.",

        "video_title": "Antibiotic Choices for Common Infections: Antibiotics Mnemonic + How to Choose an Antibiotic",
        "video_sub_title": "how's it going everyone in this video I'm going to go through the common infections that are encountered and the antibiotics that are indicated in them this is something that's often and easily forgotten but it's really important most of the recommendations are taken from the nice guidelines a quick disclaimer first though I got the main pneumonic I'm about to show you from dr. Mott and dr. Mike's video on antibiotic classifications so I will leave a link to that video as well I've added to this mnemonic the common infections that are encountered in order just to put it all together in one place we'll go through the pneumonic first then go through the infections so the original pneumonic for the antibiotic classes is antibiotics can protect the Queen's men servants and guards this stands for minibike asides cephalosporins penicillin tetracycline Quinlan's macrolides sulfonamides and glycol peptides but I'm also going to add a second class of antibiotics undersea the carbapenems now what I'm going to do is run through examples of each antibiotic as well as the general mechanism of action and side-effects then unless the most common infections by body system and port which antibiotics are most commonly used first we have amino glycosides examples include streptomycin and gentamicin and this class of antibiotics mostly works by inhibiting protein synthesis it does this by binding to the 30s subunit of bacterial ribosomes they don't affect protein synthesis in humans because we don't have 30s and 50s subunits like bacteria we have 40s and 60s amino glycosides cover gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria but they do not work on anaerobes the main side effects include nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity which occur in between 10 and 20 percent of patients general indications include UTIs endocarditis topical skin infections and pneumonia next we have the cephalosporins work by inhibiting cell wall synthesis you may already know that there are several generations of cephalosporins in fact there are five first generation are quite narrow spectrum and include cefazolin while second generation is intermediate spectrum and an example is cefotetan third generation are the ones you've probably heard the most these are considered broad spectrum antibiotics and include cefotaxime ceftriaxone and cefixime one thing to note is that ceftriaxone should not be given with calcium solutions as it can cause calcium precipitation in the lungs and the kidneys which may then be fatal fourth generation adds Pseudomonas cover and an example is set open finally fifth generation is very broad spectrum the example being set terylene cephalosporins cover gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria but have more effect on one or the other depending on the generation used side effects include hypersensitivity and super infections with enterococci enterobacter or Candida since there are so many I'll have to talk about the indications on a different page first generation covers things like methicillin sensitive staph aureus Hamas influenza strep radians and are used in upper respiratory tract infections as well as skin and soft-tissue infections the second generation covers the first gen agents as well as a coli Klebsiella nasira meningitidis and beta lactamase positive h influenza these are used in community acquired pneumonia sinusitis and skin and soft-tissue infections third gen covers a lot so all of the first generation but they also have more gram-negative action these are mostly used in community acquired pneumonia bacterial meningitis UTIs anal genital gonorrhea intra abdominal or pelvic infections alongside metronidazole or clindamycin fourth generation has Pseudomonas cover while fifth generation is quite new is effective against gram-positive as well as being broad-spectrum against gram-negative then we have the carbapenems examples include dorapin 'm mep Nome and Melbourne these also inhibit cell wall synthesis but are mostly used as last line agents because they have the ability to inhibit beta lactamase the enzyme present in some bacteria that make the resistance of the beta-lactam antibiotics including penicillin and cephalosporins kal panels cover gram-positive gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria but they do not cover mr s a side effects include GI distress rash allergies and seizures in patients with renal dysfunction indications include UTIs meningitis sepsis bone or intra abdominal and pelvic infections among other conditions like ventilator associated pneumonia and complicated skin infections penicillins next probably the most famous group of antibiotics these include amoxicillin which is nowadays one of the most common ones used as well as flucloxacillin and piperacillin these can often be combined with a beta-lactamase inhibitor such as globulin ik acid or taser bottom examples of these combinations include Cole Moxie Club and pep Taser penicillins work by inhibiting cell wall synthesis specifically by inhibiting enzymes that are necessary for the cross-linking of peptidoglycan in the cell wall penicillins generally cover gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria general side effects include hypersensitivity which can occasionally be anaphylactic and fatal additionally they can be neurotoxicity and seizures especially when there are intrathecal injections performed indications include endocarditis skin and soft-tissue infections pneumonia or upper respiratory tract infections as well as neurosyphilis just to name a few next on our list we have the tetracyclines examples include tetracycline itself and doxycycline this class of antibiotics inhibit protein synthesis in the bacteria once again bye bye to the 30s ribosomal subunit tetracyclines also have coverage of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria but generally are not used so much for strep or staph infections side effects include GI renal and reversible liver toxicity as well as the staining of teeth and retardation of fetal bone growth this is the reason why they are contraindicated in pregnant women and children under 8 years of age indications include anthrax Clostridium techni and atypical community-acquired pneumonia quinolones specifically fluoroquinolones were next and examples include ciprofloxacin labor flock season and moxifloxacin the mechanism of action is through DNA inhibition they interfere with the activity of DNA gyrase is specifically topoisomerase to and for these enzymes are responsible for causing DNA to rewind following replication this class of antibiotics also cover both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria but the so called respiratory fluoroquinolones have enhanced action against gram-positive bacteria and atypical pneumonia agents such as chlamydia mycoplasma and Legionella side effects include cartilage toxicity and an increased risk of tendon rupture particularly in the Achilles tendon there's also a risk of irreversible peripheral neuropathy as well as pseudomembranous colitis due to overgrowth of CF general indications include atypical pneumonia for the respiratory Queen loans as well as UTI gastroenteritis and osteomyelitis for ciprofloxacin macrolides were next these include clarithromycin every through myosin and ozzie through Meissen these inhibit protein synthesis too but instead they bind the 50 s ribosomal subunit and block the polypeptide exit tunnel rather than 30s subunit generally macrolides are more effective on gram positive than gram negative due to their larger size and inability to penetrate both membranes in gram-negative bacteria side effects include gie upset hypersensitivity erythromycin in particular can give cholestatic jaundice and QT prolongation that may cause the torsades arrhythmia finally the macrolides a cytochrome p450 inhibitors apart from a Z through myosin I'll leave a link to my mnemonic on the inhibitors and induces in the top right corner indications macrolides would respiratory and sinus infections as well as sti's such as chlamydia our second to last class is the cellphone amides examples include sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim which are more commonly used together than as a single agent they work by inhibiting folic acid production which is required for nucleic acid formation the combination of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim works on gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria including mrs a side effects include hypersensitivity which may lead to Steven Johnson syndrome which has 20 percent mortality nephrotoxicity is another as well as hyperkalemia neutropenia hemolytic anemia and there's also risk of car nectarous in infants which is why they are contraindicated in newborns and in the last two months of pregnancy indications include mrs a infections cystitis due to ecoli as well as listeriosis if the patient cannot take penicillin our final class of antibiotics is the glyco peptides the best known example being vancomycin vancomycin offers mrs a coverage but it's too big to get into the pores of gram-negative bacteria so it does not work on gram-negative also vancomycin can be used in patients allergic to beta-lactam antibiotics vancomycin works by binding to the d-alanine d-alanine terminal of a growing peptide chain in cell wall synthesis and thus it leads to transpeptidase inhibition side effects include nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity but compared to amino glycosides these effects are rare you may also get hypotension or red man's which is due to the flushing from histamine release if it is infused too quickly indications are mr sa endocarditis due to strep radians or enterococci and pseudomembranous colitis due to c diff ok so let's move on to the more common infections so for respiratory we have exacerbations of chronic bronchitis which is often caused by H influenza Moraxella and strep pneumo for which we could use amoxicillin or clarithromycin uncomplicated community acquired pneumonia often caused by strep pneumo call him off listen Proenza we usually use amoxicillin but doxycycline or clarithromycin are recommended in penicillin allergic patients flucloxacillin should be added if staphylococci are suspected if we suspect pneumonia caused by a typical pathogens such as chlamydia or mycoplasma we can use clarithromycin finally in hospital acquired pneumonia we should cover Pseudomonas mr sa and Klebsiella and so our options include Comox a club or cefuroxime if we are within five days of admission if we are later than five days then either piperacillin and taser back them the Broads back set was boring like ceftazidime or a queen alone such as ciprofloxacin our options as is vancomycin if it is necessary for mrs a next we have unary tract infections most commonly caused by E coli but others include Klebsiella and Staphylococcus saprophytic us an uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection is usually treated with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim or night refer and toen while an uncomplicated pyelonephritis ciprofloxacin may also be used skin infections next impetigo is primarily caused by strep pyogenes or staph aureus this is treated with topical few citic acid oral flucloxacillin or if it's widespread erythromycin cellulitis is also commonly caused by strep pyogenes or Staphylococcus aureus and is treated with flu oxacillin but if the patient is allergic to penicillin then clarithromycin arey through myosin or doxycycline may be used erysipelas is caused by group a strep once again mostly strep pyogenes and can be treated using flucloxacillin again with clarithromycin erythromycin or doxycycline if the patient is allergic to penicillin ear nose and throat infections are next on our list and they are often caused by our friend strep pyogenes once again and throat infections are generally treated by phenoxy methyl penicillin or erythromycin alone if they are allergic sinusitis is most commonly caused by strep pneumo H influenza Moraxella and once again strep pyogenes and can be treated by amoxicillin doxycycline or erythromycin next we have what itis media commonly caused by strep pneumo h influenza or Moraxella and is treated by amoxicillin erythromycin if they are allergic while otitis externa is mostly due to Pseudomonas or Staphylococcus aureus and is treated mostly by flucloxacillin or erythromycin in the case of allergy or you can even use ciprofloxacin okay now for the gentle infections gonorrhea is treated with intramuscular ceftriaxone and oral Ozzy through Meissen chlamydia is treated with doxycycline or a xethru Meissen while syphilis will require benzathine benzyl penicillin or doxycycline or erythromycin next we have bacterial vaginosis that is treated with oral or topical metronidazole or topical clindamycin finally PID or pelvic inflammatory disease can be treated with oral ofloxacin plus oral metronidazole or intramuscular ceftriaxone plus oral doxycycline and oral metronidazole okay we're nearly there second to last a gastrointestinal infections CF may be treated with metronidazole if it is mild and is the first episode while more severe or later episodes will need muncom isin't compiled enteritis is treated with clarithromycin while non typhoid Salmonella and shigellosis can both be treated with ciprofloxacin finally we have the central nervous system infections if it's a bacterial meningitis which is considered a medical emergency the microbes were likely to find depends on the mechanism or the patient's situation but generally we want to cover strep pneumo nasira meningitis he muffler's influenza and mrs AF likely so we can use antibiotics like ceftriaxone vancomycin linezolid ciprofloxacin or meropenem [Music]",

        "video_sub_title": "this is a process of managing expectations and seeing patients frequently to help them through this you don't know how long a patient's individual course is going to last and so we really have to tailor treatment we usually don't know what causes it and we have to explain that there our energy is not best spent trying to look for causes because we don't really know where to look and we don't really know in most cases what causes that we need to focus on treating the symptoms and I manage this with frequent visits so I'll see patients every two to three months throughout their course so that we can see what's working I can gauge their symptoms I can decide when we're ready to taper and when we need to go back up on a drug whenever we see a patient with our to carry of course we don't know if this is an acute episode or if this is going to the just the start of chronic idiopathic urticaria so we will start treatment immediately generally it is recommended that the first-line treatment are antihistamines and multiple antihistamines oral steroids will work and they will produce relief and there are times that we need to do this temporarily however they're not a long-term option and really the recommendation is to start with multiple antihistamines firs one of the newer treatments that we have is a biologic therapy for chronic idiopathic urticaria it's called omalizumab this is a monoclonal antibody to ige and we know that IG is very important in mediating ortak area IgE activates the basophils and the mast cells and so by binding to ige in preventing its interaction with its receptor omalizumab decreases the activation of these cells in thus the episodes of artic area the major side effect that we are worried about with the use of omalizumab is anaphylaxis and we know that these are patients who are prone to anaphylaxis by nature and so when we give them the drug there is a risk of this particularly following administration the way that we handle this is that when we give the drug in the office we monitor the patient in the office for 30 minutes following their day it's about one to two per thousand people so it's not a major concern but it is something of course that's important to be aware of and important to monitor patients and this is why we really make sure that they stay in the office we don't send them out the door after their dose",

        "video_title": "How To: REVERSE BALAYAGE TECHNIQUE To Add Depth To Overly BLONDE Hair - Tutorial",
        "video_sub_title": "hey guys brian here from free salon education here with a finally a video on how i'm going to attack ever sort of reverse balayage situation got my lovely clients age here and we've been taking her super blonde with balayage for quite some time now and now we want to go into something a little bit more natural a little bit closer to what her natural color looks like so that it's even more low maintenance because she wants to go a little darker grow the hair a little bit longer just kind of leave it alone for a little while so i've talked her into rather than just going one full dark color cuz that's just not fun for anybody i'm going to go in and work with the root color that she's got and create something similar to that and then fade that out into the hair some more so that it looks like even more of the beachy balayage that just has a few highlights rather than an all-over blonde in effect and then we're going to go in and use something a little bit just put some more color back into these ends because they've just gotten really really light so we're gonna just bring it all down just a little bit so that she feels a little deeper a little darker a little more tone to this really really bleached hair so here we go alright so here we go we're getting ready to get started the color that I mixed up for the root and mid shaft color I use Paul Mitchell the shrine's XG because I've wanted something a little bit more semi-permanent so that as this grows out I can read ress it however I need to OB it real lightening areas without it turning a funky color or even just letting things fade out on their own the color I'd mix I'm doing three parts of the 7p n to one part eight n the reason for that is she doesn't have an extremely warm base and I really want to still have a little bit of fun with the tone that we put in there so that pearl neutrals going to have sort of a cooler semi sheer finish to it so I think it'll be really really pretty it'll really blend the mid-shaft that I create in with her natural and so to start off what I'm just going to do for the first step is I'm just going to go in and apply this just as a regular root retouch and then from there we'll be where I start to really create a the reverse balayage effect so here we go alright so I'm going through and just doing like I said just a very typical root retouch making sure to work off of her actual part because just like doing a balayage the other way with Lightner I want to make sure that I'm doing it based on how her hair just naturally lives how she's going to wear it herself so going in the part going through doing the world's fastest route retouch ever I'm not concerned with making sure that I feather it out too too far yet because as I go in in this next part after this I'm really going to zero in on areas and create the design of the shadow that I want it to be so I'm giving myself just enough feather out of that root color so that I can work quickly and easily through the next part which is right now so going through I'm really just trying to create basically I'm creating the shadow if you go back and watch some of my other balayage videos prep probably most easily the the beach blonde balayage that I came out with where I put Lightner into the hair making sure to leave plenty of her natural eyes shadow I'm literally just doing the opposite right now I'm making sure that I'm leaving those outer edges of the hairline light so that when the hair gets pulled back there's the shadow of the the center back of her head with the lightness sort of running along the edge of all of those layers that are in her hair I used a paddle for this because I like the consistency of the shines XG because I knew that using that paddle is sort of a backboard it's just going to help me press that color through to make sure that I had a really good saturation because if you don't saturate through you know you might end up with like some spotty that sort of accidental turdus tortoiseshell kind of look so that backboard really just helps make sure that I get saturation that I need around the face making sure that I'm just picturing that if I was doing this with Lightner where would I be putting highlights in and then just doing the opposite I'm creating highlights with what she already has and yeah just creating that cool beachy shadow not really soaking it all the way through the ends because I do want her to have that lightness you know sort of starting off just a little bit towards the root and then really building up lighter and lighter towards the ends so as we finish up you see I paint the back side of most sections sometimes even going into the middle of a section to create that V with the lightness all right so now we're all done as you can see I went through and I was just creating the look of Bali Oz but doing the opposite of what I normally do I've got delight now I'm adding the dark so where I would normally ride along the outside of a section I just left that hair out and painted the inside with my darker color around the face I made sure that I left those little pieces around the the part line that I really really like to always make sure that I add I left them totally untouched except for the root because it's supposed to be a nice fruity look so now what we're going to do is I'm going to process this for the full like 25 30 minutes then I'm going to wash her I'll probably go ahead and well we'll say probably going to dryer before I put on the out the color for the end because I just want to let everything process to the full amount that it's supposed to and I feel like if I put the ends on now then I'm either going to not be able to leave them on long enough or I'm going to have to leave the roots on longer than you're supposed to I just want to do it all right so that looks really nice for you guys okay alright so here we go we got step one done I process the roots in the mid shafts brought her back to the sink washed her out did a quick blow-dry as you can see even now it already looks really pretty we've got what would be normal balayage highlights in there with nice root but I still want to go in and do a color to soften these ends well this is pretty I still I want to make it just a little bit more blended I want to bring the end color a little bit closer to the root color that we just created but even for that not bad huh just looking pretty good you can see we've got that nice shadow in there we really just rich rich in DUP her root a little bit because uh you know who doesn't look better with a little hair color and all right so here we go alright so here we go get ready to do the ends I mixed together I stayed with the shines XG for the same reasons that I wanted it on the root but this time I'm using most no equal parts 9pn and 9n with a little splash of clear just to give it a little bit more translucency ah and 10 volume so here we go we're going to apply it process it cutter blow her out and then you finally get to see what she looks like so for her end color I wanted to make sure that I was sort of living in the same color world as the root color that I created because when you're using Lightner to create a balayage you're working off of what their base actually is so since I'm doing this in Reverse I wanted to create the same thing I had that PN as the main base for her root color so I wanted to make sure that I had that as one of this one of the more dominant colors in her ends as well because I wanted it all to blend I wanted it to look very natural so that if you know she's in a situation where she's looking to have her hair done less I've given her something nice and natural looking to sort of grow out very gracefully and yeah this was the perfect color for that alright so you'll notice I didn't go down to the root with this because it was absolutely no reason to I went close because I wanted to make sure that I didn't miss any of the highlights that I did leave a little bit closer at the root but I ran everything through now I'm just gonna sit in process for a half hour and we'll do a quick little trim and you get to see the final result thanks alright so here it is we got sages final look you can check it out here I like because when it's down it's just a nice blended canvas here but then as you run through you really see that illusion of that deep valley eyes would that shadow at the root with the nice highlights framing around the layers here and people might ask how come I didn't just do it all at once and smush to the ends I really wanted to the the semi-permanent that I used on the ends has a lot of reparative properties to it so I really wanted to sit it for the full processing time just to help make sure that the ends feel nice and pretty and soft so here she is I can't start running my hands through it do you love it I love it yeah alright so thanks guys be sure to check us out on YouTube and free salon education comm check me out on instagram at hairstyle thanks hope you enjoy the video have a great day you",

lot of Florida brands like shadow Sabrosa and there just happened to be like 25 minutes down the road for me there's pretty cool always so cute I actually picked up some white rims I'm loving the white rim so much on the 240 and the mini that I decided I want white on my bike that's gonna look like that now we're pulling up to the best bike shop in Florida mr. bikes um boys I'm gonna see if Chad can lace up my new rims for me just being stupid yeah I didn't break there you go this is art yeah I'm gonna put on my wall it kind of looks sick doesn't it no that's a bad idea yeah so if you're local and you need wheels lace come to mr. baiken boards because they charge $20 I know some people are complaining about shops charging like $120 that's ridiculous Chad builds wheels in the sleep don't scratch my spokes ash look how pretty this is I actually had Nicole's white wheels laying next to my bike awhile ago and I thought it looked really cool so that's why I got white rims from my bike I don't know what I'm gonna really do now I know I'm planning on riding OSP later tonight I just don't know if I'm gonna go home maybe put my new frame together or if it's gonna be too late and I'm gonna end up doing something else but I'll make it interesting now I haven't really done anything like this in a while but I thought cool I have a new frame I have to build up a new frame why not use the opportunity to make like a little instructional segment in this video on how to build up a new BMX frame so here it is I'm gonna be using a bike stand just to make it easier to film and show you guys but you can definitely do this on the ground a bike stands not necessary I have a brand new frame and then the tools you will need will be a chain breaker some lubricant for your bottom bracket which you have to get to make sure it's the same size as your spindle and your cranks and then you also need a set of Allen wrenches and whatever type of socket tool you need to get your back wheel off it's a super simple process I've done it a million times but it can definitely be a little bit overwhelming if you've never done anything like this with your bike before we sell bottom brackets on my website with the frame and we also sell headsets in case you want a new fresh one while you're rebuilding everything first step remove the seat jeez that's a long seat post now we'll remove the back wheel top the chain off pull it out of there we're gonna take the cranks off now always make sure that you use metric allen wrenches if your parts are metric which 99% are a lot of people use American tools and then they strip their bolts and then message me asking where they can get new ones in some bikes you'll be able to pull the cranks right off and others it'll be tight so we'll need the help of my trusty little friend put the bolt back in fire away boom slide this on out and make sure not to lose any of those little pieces tap the spindle out now make sure not to get grease all over your nice new carpet now all we have left is the front end in the chain taking off the chain is the part that sucks my chain Baker is actually like super broken so I have to make it like super janky to work but you're gonna want a good chain breaker and then just pop the pinout but when you do leave it so it's still on the other side a little bit I'll show you so if you leave a little bit hanging over like that you can just kind of snap it out and then you'll still have a little hangover take it off and now you're gonna remove your top cap all right you're gonna loosen the pinch bolts now on the stem but there's no need to remove them once they're loose you should be able to just wiggle your Forks right out if you're saving your headset take it out and put it aside tip two getting the bottom one out take your Forks upside down and go bingo now your hands are probably certainly covered in grease so this is when you go get paper towels and apologize to your mom for getting grease all over the place now I'm anticipating there's gonna be some comments down below like Adam you should give away your old frame you should do a giveaway you should give it away well it's my first signature frame it was a prototype and it means a lot to me so I really don't wanna give this one away however I am planning on doing a giveaway with a brand new LZ frame my idea for the giveaway it's gonna be kind of like a scavenger hunt on YouTube I'm gonna have like a bunch of questions and then you guys are gonna answer them and they're gonna be all pulled from old videos so if you watch a lot of my videos you will have a good advantage I want to reward the top fans and this is a way that I thought I'd be able to I just have to work out the details on how you guys will submit the answers and how we're gonna deal with that so stay tuned cuz that will be coming soon now you open up your brand-new LZ frame and get super excited so pretty ok now you're gonna light coating and grease right over your bottom bracket it's gonna go it's good to put some on actual bearings as well help stop your frame on the ground you're just gonna rest the bearing in there now some people tell you you need a bearing press or you're gonna damage the bearings I've been bashing mine in for years and never had any issues so go for it some people put this little spacer in there it's supposed to prevent the bearings from pressing in towards each other I never do I never have so I'm not going to every bikes different but you're gonna want to slide the bottom bracket in if you can and make sure that you have enough spacers so your cranks don't hit your frame I like to normally have about this much space you can run last but if you're kind like she might damage the frame Nicole's playing dress-up while I'm filming this video she keeps walking and you're showing me all these outfits I like that dress why and why I think it looks nice put your other crank on you don't want to put it on like this you want to put it on so it's going straight up and down and so they're perfectly parallel a lot of people have a hard time lining it up so one thing I say to use there's kind of line it up with dish that's a guide get it right you'll be able to just kind of press the pedals and you won't really move much but if you get it wrong you'll let go and then they'll just flop forward so your cranks might have a pinch bolt in which case you're gonna tighten down the compression until your cranks don't really move then loose a little bit and tighten the pinch bolt in my case I just tighten as much as I can because I don't like my cranks to move this is a good time to clean off your grimy headset bearings and grease them up fresh before you put them back in proper order is barring little shim thingy and then top cap the bottom comes with the race but chances are your Forks already have a race so you won't even need it slide the fork on in it's very important that when you put your stem back on you make sure you have enough spacers to make the fork or assess so when you put in the compression cap it will pull everything snug together if it's hanging loose you're gonna have a loose head set and it's gonna suck we're gonna come back to the head set later once the bikes on the ground slip the back wheel on here it's really important to line your chain up and make sure that it's the proper length if it's too short you're gonna need a new chain and if it's too long you're gonna need to cut a shorter always be cautious and don't break your chain and make it too short it's better to have it a little bit long realize it take a link out and then put it back on top the seat in tighten the compression cap till your bars won't spin and then back off just a hair make sure it's lined up with the wheel and then tighten the pinch bolts now the last step is to admire your new frame take a picture post it up to Instagram and tag me in it Adam winter squirrel Z so I can see your fresh new frame if you got one of my friends sick thank you so much if not still sick so that you just put together your first frame it's currently pouring out but the weather forecast is it's gonna slow down and I really want to ride my bike I haven't got a chance to try the new frame yet so I'm heading to Taylor's house to pick him up I didn't really talk about it but because my chain breaker was so messed up I wasn't able to get my chain right so it's like super sue super tight I'm hoping I'll just stretch out but I don't know I just normally I write on Thursdays but I think Thursday we're actually gonna go over to Tampa to RS enthalpy and Martin's gonna retune my 240 so it'll be good for the event pretty sure it's just messed up because when he tuned it it had boost leaks so he had to lean it out a little bit so I wouldn't get too much fuel now that the car is getting more air because the booze leaks are fixed it's running too lean so he says it's a super easy fix I just got a drive out there that check do you have to 70 bucks on Amazon to understand books tip to day bro today I'm so good I forgot my helmet so I hope Taylor has one for me is that my album yeah I would make you get a rental numb knees no these bugs are so freaking loud shut up bugs I just called the skate park and apparently closed so I think we're gonna go try to ride this little outdoor park I'll probably be wet but whatever we just pulled up to the park and it's too dark to ride and the park closes in six minutes I'm sorry sure so we can see how I'm sad yeah so we decided to go the bounce house because physical activity hooray America talent into a bounce house in a long time we both we both suck so this is gonna be a lot different than when I went with Tanner

        "video_sub_title": "[Music] have you ever wanted to make your own incense have you ever thought about settling your own incense in this video you will learn how to prepare a custom incense that you can use for yourself or sell the first item you'll need will be unscented incense sticks I have a pack here it's about a hundred you will also need a container to soak the incense sticks in I've chosen a tall relatively thin container here and I'll explain that later why even want to use a container like that in your DP g DB g is a cutting oil it's used to dilute the fragrance oil and help the fragrance oil to be absorbed into the incense sticks you'll also need fragrance oil fragrance oil is what gives the wonderful variety of scents - incense this is part of incense making where you can be most creative you can try different fragrances and mix different fragrances together to make your own new fragrance blends for this tutorial I've used orange patchouli we have a 16-ounce bottle here which is a nice size - for mixing to make the mixture you'll need to put the incense sticks into smaller quantities you can use but it's kind of hard to fill up the container for soaking finally a container in which to drive the incense sticks that's not shown here but you'll need a container in which to put the sticks after you finish soaking them to dry the back out again and get them ready to be burned alright let's get started first put all your supplies together on a good stable working surface one thing to remember is that fragrance oil is pretty strong stuff so you may want to do this in a garage or basement area where you won't have to smell the fragrance oil all day we'll start by adding the fragrance oil to the soaking container as I said before we will be using half of a one-pound bottle of orange patchouli fragrance oil for this batch of incense sticks you okay that looks about right now we'll out the DPG to the soaking container for the DPG we have the whole one-pound bottle you you you might want to save this bottle for later after you finish making your incense sticks you'll have a lot of incense mixture fragrance mixture left over and you can either make more sticks immediately or you can save this mixture to use later if you got like a funnel or something you can pour this mixture back into that use DPG bottle let's go away a story keeps it nice and sealed now we'll just mix this up a little bit to get it nicely combined and now we have the unscented incense sticks for this tutorial I'll untie them so that they'll be more distributed in the mixture this isn't really necessary and if you'll be making these to resale you might want to keep them in the tide packs of 100 that way you can just resell the whole pack all once and you don't have to retie it back together I'd be careful when you're adding the incense sticks to the into the fragrance mixture so it doesn't overflow you don't want to get that fragrance oil all over your work surface you okay your incense is now soaked for 24 hours and it's ready to be removed from the fragrance mixture and dried as you can see I'm using gloves I use gloves because I don't like to get the fragrance all on my hands even when I wash with soap afterwards that smell just can stay on for a long time and its really strong so I'm using gloves that way I can just throw the gloves out afterwards and don't have to worry about it for drying I'll be using this plastic container this container is nice because it's large enough to put all the incense sticks in and I let some air flow around and so they'll dry out nice and quick for any container you're going to use you're going to want a plastic container or metal is okay take the incense sticks out of the fragrance mixture and place it in the drying container [Music] you I'm going to spread the sticks out a bit so they'll dry faster if your sticks are still tied together and you can leave them tied they'll just take a little bit more time to finish drying now you can take the used fragrance mixture and either make some more incense with it immediately or you can store it in a container with a good lid for future use like the original DPG container as I said before let the incense sticks dry for about 24 hours that way they won't be too sticky you might also if you've left your insistence tied together in bundles of 100 you might want to let them dry for 48 hours to be sure because you don't want to have oil dripping out of them when you sell them or even when you're moving them around just because you don't to get oil all over the place after the 24 hour drying period is up your incense is ready to burn or sell this is a good time to check out your incense and see if you really like the way the smell came out so I mean some fragrances will work better than others certain fragrances just don't really smell that great when you burn them a good option is to try out a few different ones if you can announce oil here an ounce of oil another kind and then then try them out with really small batches and maybe ten fifteen incense sticks then when you burn them you can check them and see you know what really smells good to you and what smells your customers might like if you're reselling these and then after that you can go ahead and go move up to the larger batches where you fill up something like what I'm doing here with a pound and a half of mixture one pound of fruit one pound of DPG and half a pound of fragrance oil you can put those together I wouldn't I wouldn't do this quantity until you really sort of know what's going to smell good it's really it's really up to you to test this out and try it out and see what see what works best good luck with your incense [Music]",

all right so what we're gonna do just move over just move over to the side look it's gonna be the lateral epicondyle of the females so to find the lateral epicondyle of FEMA you can have the person flex and you're gonna feel the bony get a little more you're gonna feel the bony lateral epicondyles right over here so now the moveable aunt the immovable arm which is the stationary arm is gonna be the medial aspect of the femur pointing towards the greater trochanter so in order to find the dreaded the greater trochanter you gonna have the person slightly AB duck and you'll feel it pop out so it should be right around yet so roughly technically you don't you could just have it pointed in the medial aspect of the of the side so you're gonna find the greater trochanter once again I'm sorry all right so we found it there's your fall from stationary are movable arm all right Tony flex all the way so this is 100 and 17 degrees okay hey this Tony hi so now slightly just relax please push and now it's 130 degrees so now if he was to do extension which now extension is crucial this is this is the one that I think you really need you really need a towel for because Tony if I if I don't have a towel for Tony we're not doing him any justice because it's not the table is gonna stop his extension so if we prop them up like this so now we have a little bit more more breathing room right so now we find that the greater trochanter once again so I'm sorry okay found it okay now let's extend okay all the way it's still not it's still not a hundred set but in theory you're loved yeah it's actually it may actually be a negative number it depends on the person but you see how the number is not high it's low yeah it's it's closer to zero because extending so the general rule extension you're close to the zero flexing you're closer to 135 so like if what you just did if if I was listen ever write a zero degrees er you would say whatever his number is but tell the teacher who I was doing it ideally it's it's supposed to be zero degrees but if he says negative to tell him I gonna chill it shows that yeah doesn't matter just say but just for York just for your reference you know we can't physically be right so all right so now if I'm gonna flex just envision there's uh an arm with leg flexing if I'm gonna flex this is the move and move along so now if I'm gonna flex my angles getting closer to 135 and right now it's at 131 if I was to extend that same arm my arm is coming down I'm extending I'm coming closer to 0 and I may even go a little bit more than 0 in the negative direction it may even be negative 5 for instance that's hyperextension but don't the numbers in the top but are those negative no don't worry about negative positive whatever number that the general rule states that if you're closer if when flexing you if in this angle you're closer to 135 extending you're closer to zero whatever number that says if it's past zero put a negative in front of it okay you won't have to worry about negative numbers inflection because they don't exist only in negative only an extension do negative numbers exist okay cool thank you now and then",

        "video_sub_title": "Is it possible to get rid of hoarseness quickly and if so how to cure a hoarse voice in an hour? Stay tuned because I am sharing practical tips on treating hoarseness so that you can get your voice back as soon as possible. Hi! I am Katarina, speech language pathologist from How 2 Improve Singing and here on this channel, I share practical tips about using your voice in a healthy way. So, if this is a topic that interests you, consider subscribing to this channel and hitting that bell notification icon so that you don\u2019t miss any of my videos. So, the big question is: can you cure hoarseness in an hour? Well, it depends. I don\u2019t have any magical formulas or potions but I have a story that demonstrates that you can get rid of acute hoarseness in a very short period of time. But first, let\u2019s make it clear that there are some types of hoarseness, which cannot be cured quickly. I am talking about chronic hoarseness of voice. If you have been suffering from hoarse voice for more than 2 weeks, meaning you are experiencing chronic hoarseness, and now you expect your voice to magically cure within a few hours, you are in for a huge disappointment. Chronic hoarseness requires time and a more complex approach than a few quick tips. I talk about treatment of chronic hoarseness in a different video. So, if that is you, click here to watch that video right now. Also, if you are hoarse or lost your voice due to an acute viral illness such as common cold or flu, there may not be a quick solution that will get your voice back in an hour. You can certainly try some of the tips that I share in this video but usually, the viral infection has to run its course and your voice will come back when the sickness goes away. It is still possible to use your voice or even sing when you are sick but it is not ideal. In cases of acute hoarseness due to a viral infection, the best emergency vocal remedy includes lots of fluids like water or warm teas with lemon, honey or ginger, vocal rest, warm steam for your voice, good nasal hygiene and sleep. But it may take a few days to get your voice back. So, let\u2019s go back to our question: is it possible to cure hoarseness in an hour? Yes, if the hoarseness is a symptom of vocal fold swelling due to one short-term episode of vocal misuse. Let me tell you a story. My son loves to sing and he was invited to sing at a half-time show during a football game at his high school. His preferred genre of music is classical singing and jazz, that\u2019s his vocal training background. However, to entertain the teenage masses at a football game, the school band opted for a heavier type of music and they played Ozzy Osbourne and Steppenwolf. My son decided to add some grunts and roughness to the sound and after 30-minute performance, he ended up with a hoarse voice. Of course, he did not know how to grunt in a healthy way, he never did it before. When I picked him up after the performance, he could barely talk. His voice was weak, raspy and breathy. I immediately ordered him to stay quiet on the way home, even though I was very eager to know how the performance went. On the way to the car, I also bought a cup of warm tea for him. Instead of talking, we listened to some music in the car. When we came home, I asked him to still keep silent so he spent some time texting with his friends. I made him more warm tea with ginger and lemon and he steamed his voice. After about an hour, his voice cleared and he was no longer hoarse. However, my trained ears still heard some breathiness in his speaking voice. So, I suggested that he takes the night off from talking and does \u201cquiet work\u201d, which meant playing on the computer in silence. His voice was back to normal within 24 hours and he decided not to sing heavy metal again or at least without proper training. So, here are three learning points from the story: 1. You can heal a hoarse voice in a short period of time. The main trick is vocal rest. Here is why. My son\u2019s hoarseness was a symptom of vocal fold swelling. He grinded his vocal folds due to bad vocal technique. As a result, there was a fluid build up inside the vocal folds, which is actually a protective mechanism to avoid more serious damage. When the vocal folds are thick, they cannot vibrate normally, which results in changes in voice quality. Luckily, vocal folds have an amazing ability to self-restore if you give them a chance. And that is exactly what vocal rest does. Plus, good hydration in the form of warm teas and steam inhalation also helped. 2. My son was lucky that his vocal misuse resulted only in vocal fold swelling and he did not harm his voice even more, for example with vocal hemorrhage. Vocal fold hemorrhage is when a blood vessel on the vocal fold ruptures and the vocal fold fills with blood. This is a serious vocal emergency and is treated with absolute voice rest and requires attention of a voice professional. So, remember, not all types of hoarseness are easy to \u201cfix\u201d. So, don\u2019t play with fire and avoid vocal misuse whenever you can. 3. Finally, hoarseness is a symptom, not a disease. There are many different causes of hoarse voice and they are treated differently. It is important to know the cause in order to plan a successful treatment. Vocal rest, hydration and good vocal hygiene are the first line of treatment options for any type of hoarseness. But if your voice is hoarse for more than 2 weeks, make an appointment with your doctor and have your voice checked in order to prevent a serious vocal problem. For example, if you suddenly experience hoarseness without a presence of acute viral infection such as common cold or flu, order yourself vocal rest and improve your vocal hygiene. But if you don\u2019t see any improvements in the next few days, then it is time to find professional help. And that is all for today.

start off with this set of fail and it is just a very basic moisturizer good for sensitive skin good for newborn so I tells you how good it is for sensitive skin then we're going to use this HD primer by Makeup Forever and then we're gonna use this Mac Paint sublime nature to prep the lids because all y'all are going to get some nasty oily greasy lids if you don't use a primer I definitely recommend investing on one of these urban decay also has a really great primer but check the paint pots out by Matt good they're pretty affordable so now we're going to take this silver shadow and apply that all over the lid under the crease using a dense brush like the one I've got here I use is pretty often to my tutorials it's great for picking up a lot of product and just depositing it onto the lid making sure it adheres and because we use the base it's going to stick really well and we're going to take this white shadow and apply that right over top this is going to give your glitter a little bit more intensity and making it opaque now you're going to take this electric blue it's a mat and apply that to the outer corners using a brush with longer bristle so as you can see I've uses brush before in previous tutorials as well and it just really helps with blending blending is very important with this look now we're going to take that same white shadow and use it as a brow highlight so just make sure that you're using again a long hair bristle brush and apply that right under the brows now I'm gonna take this matte black eyeshadow by Makeup Forever and apply that to the outermost outer corners of the eye and this is really going to give you that nice smokey effect again the key is to blend it all in really nicely and again i'm going to my long hair bristle brush and use that to blend now we want to make sure that we get a good amount of pavement on here so i'm going to go back in with my blue and go over the outer corners it's all about layering and getting a nice opaque lid so for my lanterns negative using a cake liner and the benefits of this is that it there's a long-lasting color and doesn't fade through a good day and it looks pretty flawless and gives you nice to find eyes it's also very precise and I find it's more precise when using an angled brush so as you can see a lot of the shadow has fallen under I mean were you working with glitters Dark Shadows that's ok you want to clean it up after you do the eyes first you do the concealing and foundation later now what i'm doing here is i'm just adding the liner to the inner corners of the eyes want to make sure you go all the way in if you have very close I dies then skip this step so now we're going to fill the brows I find using a grey shadow is great for someone with black hair you don't want to use a black or a dark brown because I find it ends up looking very unnatural so use a gray so now using a smaller brush this is just like the rush we use for a crease but smaller we're going to take that and we're going to wrap the color all the way around the eye so it's the same thing of what you did on the top now we're doing it to the bottom my camera kind of turned off when I was doing this so this is a finished product hopefully you get the gist of how to accomplish it and if you have any questions please feel free to leave me a comment so now we just want apply some false lashes is it pretty dramatic they're great for grad you want to make sure after they're dried you take your mascara and you run it through your natural lashes through the false lashes so we don't really do much concealing because she has amazing skin we're just going to add a little bit of foundation even up the skin tone I'm not going to do liner because for running other times so you want to have a nice natural lick you don't want to pull the focus away from the eyes just keep it nice and natural and you can throw some gloss over top of that as well what is Hannah human eye lashes come from usually like leg hair of course it's not lag here it's made from underarm hair come on people it's got that boom or like texture because of the perspiration just gets soaked in there so you make your lashes to brag or anything but I'm lucky enough to be able to make all my own lashes I grown up here for that tanaaz can take my list with arden do bronzer and apply that your cheeks not

        "video_title": "How to Reduce BLOATING | Part 2 - Foods | Get Flat Tummy!",
        "video_sub_title": "[Music] hey everyone welcome back so today I'm going to talk about the foods that make you bloat so obviously everyone's different so some of these foods are not going to cause any bloating issues for you but it can cause a major building issues for people like me before we get into the details of the food section cause building you need to know about partners so for necks are basically the type of foods that can cause building because these other foods that gets fermented in your large intestine that causes bloating so the food sales I'll be talking about today are basically fournette both of them anyway well the number one culprit when it comes to bloating is Christmas specials so and I'm really really sensitive to vegetables a broccoli cauliflower kale all these vegetables contain a kowai drink or a sugar cause retinas and our body do not produce the enzyme to break them down so what happens is that it passed through our small intestine without being digested going into our large intestine the bacteria in our last test line are going to fit under and produce a lot of gas which is going to be very uncomfortable so that's the reason why like sometimes we get bloated from getting certain type of vegetables and especially if they're not cooked so I personally still eat all these vegetables I just cook them because cooking death is going to make it a lot easier to digest it's still not going to be able to digest carbohydrates recognize but it's going to increase the the area of digestion which is going to make it a lot easier with tummy but don't avoid eating down completely because they are both nutrients especially start greens and all the strips and vegetables are so full of nutrients so don't stop eating that just keep them in moderation so the second reason why it you might be bloated it's because of unofficial sweeteners sugar alcohols all these things are not going to be able to be bested so it's going to go to your life and test time again the bacteria will feed on them and then some produce double yes because the by-product of bacteria in the tummy is guessed so if you're going to keep feeding in a Russian person then you're going to get some guest issues so onions or garlic are also high format foods so they contain this carbohydrates called Krypton and our body again comes by distance so it can cause bloating in your large intestine so what you do again is to cook that and it's going to ease the digestion process but yeah never consume too much garlic and onion in one go just like broccoli and kale and everything else I think most people know that beans causes bloating because they contain a sugar just like the others that can't be digested so it's going to log into your lash into sign and get cemented by this bacteria in your gut and that's gonna cause a lot of gas so the idea behind bloating is that the foot can be digested it goes into your large intestine or your gut and the bacteria inner guard is going to cement on it so it's going to cause loss gas so that basically the idea behind bloating so the next one of these are like lentils peas what our soybeans they're all part of the same family so the other cause gas problems as well because they have this carbide rate that can be digested by your time so what you can do in this case is sprouted beans and also like activated not so sprouted or so or fermented stuff are gonna be a lot easier for you to digest so yeah maybe you can try to out instead of getting rid off eating my lentils beans completely there next is lactose cheese anything that's made from milk so this is basically a type of intolerance that your body can die slackers so you can take a digestive enzyme lattice to help with that or is just don't eat them so it's really up to how you feel and this is your body so you may call on whether you still want to continue eating that whole space products there is a digestive enzyme we know that's going to help to digest vegetables so you can try to take that if you really really want to eat beans or peas I've never taken it before so maybe that's something that you can try so next is apple peaches these are the fruits that are very high in fructose and if you are allergic to fructose we have fructose intolerance and this is going to cause bloating next sometimes people are confused of this bloating viewing with water retention so if you have too much high sodium foods and so if you eat a lot take out if you have a lot and packaged processed food and the high chance that you're going to get bloated from water retention so that's probably the least problematic one because what you can do if you have more potassium rich foods like bananas colors that's going to help you to balance out your sodium level in your body dream or supporter is beer and carbonated drink not many people are going to be happy to hear it especially if you are a beer lover so beer is made from fermented body so Valley is glutinous also equal to intolerant and will cause bloating issues but if you're drinking beer or any carbonated drinks you're basically ingesting gas or fiercely you're going to be bloated and that is in verb which I can't attend this is the most common problem for a lot of people these days is that you're allergic to gluten and that's gonna cost building so we rye and barley they're all part of this gluten family so some people can't have gluten because obviously just with tolerance if you are person intolerant then you have to avoid getting bitten t not get bloated because that's gonna make you feel sick some people who exhausted just from being gluten so if that's what you're allergic to you can't eat them so listen can be found in beer can be done in bread cake croissants and also this a lot of food these days are gluten-free and so I don't think being with the intolerant is too bad anymore because those are foods are gluten-free so that's it for today's video I hope you find this video helpful so these other things that I've learned over the years because I do have a lot of problems when it comes to bloating yeah I do have a major crimes like every every month because I can't be bothered sometimes I just want to eat okay so yeah I hope you guys find this helpful and please give this video a thumbs up and I'll see you guys in the next video

        "video_title": "The Bubble Pull Through Braid Tutorial For Short Hair - Braiding Made Easy",
        "video_sub_title": "(upbeat instrumental music) - [Voiceover] Hi, guys. In this video, I'd like to show you this alternative pull-through braid. You know how sometimes the most interesting hairstyles happen by accident? Well in this case, I attempted to do a regular one, but I somehow got distracted and ended up with this. Let's just go ahead and begin. We're gonna start off by brushing out all your hair and then you're going to part a new section on the top of your head and tie it off in a ponytail. Then clip it away for now and create a second ponytail right underneath that first one. Then you're going to release the first ponytail, divide it into two equal sections, bring that lower ponytail over through the first one. Then pin it to the top so it's not in the way for now. Then you're going to incorporate new hair from the sides into those two hanging pieces from the first ponytail and you're going to tie everything off in a third ponytail. So now you release the ponytail above and here's where things will change. Instead of parting the ponytail above, you're going to part the lower ponytail into two pieces, bring them up and pin them away. And now you continue as normal. You incorporate new hair from the sides, except now you're incorporating them with the upper ponytail, which will create the bubble part of the braid. Now you release the two sections you have pinned to the top, bring the lower ponytail over and through them and pin it away for now. In other words, you're going to do a regular pull-through braid step. Incorporate new hair with these two sections and create a new ponytail underneath. And now again, it's time to do the bubble braid step, which means you divide the lower ponytail, bring it up or to the side or wherever it's convenient to pin it away. And you incorporate new hair from the sides, with that hanging piece and create another ponytail underneath. And you do this all the way down, so as you can see, every other step is the regular pull-through braid and the bubble braid. This will make it look like you have a bubble braid with a pull-through braid coming from underneath it. The only thing left now is to pull out the braid. My hair is now more layered than the first time I did it, but if your hair is not, then there's really no limits to how full you can make this appear. You can also tuck it under and pin it in place. So this is the finished look and I hope you like it. Thank you so much for watching. If you enjoyed this tutorial, it would mean a lot to me if you gave this video a thumbs up and of course, subscribed. Hope to see you next time. Bye.",

        "video_title": "Sciatica Pain Relief For Piriformis Syndrome - Stretches and Exercises",
        "video_sub_title": "what's up guys hey jared beckstrand here doctor of physical therapy tonintiten.com do you have a tight hip with pain that shoots down your leg you might have what we call a piriformis syndrome today i wanted to talk to you all about piriformis syndrome what it is why you get it and specifically most importantly about eight things that you can do right now at home to eliminate yours let's get into it right now all right so what exactly is sciatica now sciatica is an umbrella term that we typically use for irritation to the sciatic nerve your your nerves come down your spinal cord they come down your back and they exit out at each of various levels now those lowest nerves in your back they come out of your lower back and they kind of come together to form three major nerves that are then wrapped in a big old sheath and then that's what travels down your leg so it's those collection is that collection of those three nerves wrapped in that common sheath that travels down your leg that we refer to as the sciatic nerve now sciatica is a symptom not a diagnosis and so if you go to the doctor and the doctor says well yeah you have sciatica that is simply describing that nerve pain that you're experiencing down your leg why is it there that's the diagnosis that's the thing that we want to really get to the bottom of why do you have that sciatic nerve pain or that sciatica now the three main causes that i see probably the most common cause that i see is going to be a bulge disc or a herniated disc or just disc irritation things like that are what i hear a lot of in my physical therapy clinic if that's the case if that's your case i actually shot a video on some great things that you can do for a herniated disc or a bulge disc i'm going to leave a link to that in the description below also click on this one right up here that's the link to get to that video if you have a herniated disc that's the best treatment for those second most common cause that i see of sciatica would be disc deterioration or disc degeneration or also termed as ddd for degenerative disc disease sometimes also referred to as stenosis can be another cause of or another symptom of that disc degeneration if you know that you have those things i'm going to leave the links to another video again check the description out check this link right here if you have that disc degeneration those are going to be the best treatment for you but now okay here we go what if you actually have this piriformis tightness or this piriformis syndrome let's talk first of all about exactly what that is and so if i grab my spine model here um your pelvis is made up of three bones and so you've got basically two on either side and one in the middle right here you have a muscle so the piriformis muscle attaches to the inside part of your tailbone kind of right in this area it goes across the hip bone across the hip joint and it attaches you've kind of got you know your hip ball and socket sits out here and that muscle attaches into that outside of that bone on that side and so it kind of takes this oblique course across the across the lower back and so again here's my here's my tailbone right here and so from that inside border of that sacrum out to you can feel that bone on the side of your hip it comes right through that course right there now the anatomy is important because again those lowest nerves in your back there we go those lowest nerves in your back that come together to form that sciatic nerve they actually exit right in that area some of them actually go under that piriformis so if here's my piriformis muscle that sciatic nerve goes right underneath it in some rare cases that sciatic nerve even bifurcates or even goes through that piriformis muscle and so any tightness in that piriformis can actually cause sciatic nerve symptoms because of that irritation and so specifically that's what we refer to when we talk about piriformis syndrome tightness in the piriformis that impinges on your sciatic nerve that causes those radiating pains down into your leg now what causes some of this piriformis syndrome i'd say the most common causes that i see are people who spend a lot of time seated and so the more we sit the more constant and prolonged pressure is going to be in that area that can pinch upon that nerve if you sit all day especially on a wallet and so if i had a wallet underneath here and i spent all day sitting on that oftentimes that can be a cause of this piriformis syndrome just that prolonged pressure from that people who sit a lot with their legs crossed so if i sat all day long like this all of a sudden my hip is in this externally rotated position there's some tension on that on there's an increased pull through that piriformis muscle increased pressure on that sciatic nerve that's another common symptom that i see um pregnancy you ladies who may have some of these radiating symptoms down your leg if it's not coming from a disc or your sciatic or your sacroiliac joint or your si joint a lot of times it can be from this piriformis muscle i'm going to bring my wife in here in just a second she can tell you all about pregnancy and this and this piriformis syndrome and then um weakness is another thing if you've got weak glutes if you've got weak glute max glute mead glute man if you've got weak piriformis those can all be actually causes of this piriformis syndrome too okay enough of this chit chat so now you guys have a good understanding of what it is i hope you have a good understanding of why you get it what i want to run through now are some of my most commonly recommended fixes for it actually the best thing to do i i recommend to people all the time in my physical therapy clinic is to take a three-fold approach to this and so we've got to alleviate the tension and so we're going to do that via massage i'm going to show you some self-massage techniques some stretches and so again i'm just going to show you about four or five stretches that you can do to stretch out that tight piriformis and then finally we've got to strengthen that if it is a muscle weakness issue so i've got a couple of home exercises you can do to also strengthen that piriformis that piriformis muscle up so let's get into those right now all right so once again i brought in my lovely assistant to help demonstrate some of these exercises to you guys we're going to start first with the massage techniques to that piriformis now massage is a great way i mean with any muscle if you're tight and if you have knots in that muscle massage is a great way to alleviate those and so i wanted to show you a couple of my favorite massage techniques but keep in mind the cause of this pain is that piriformis is tight on that sciatic nerve in order to massage that piriformis we have to actually kind of increase pressure on it and so it's not uncommon for this to increase some of your symptoms if it's unbearable she's already got the we tried the tennis ball just barely we'll get there if it's unbearable you guys not important spend some time stretching it out instead however if you can tolerate it some of these piriformis release techniques are going to be great a great way to help alleviate some of that tension okay so to get into this foam roller i like a foam roller because it's bigger it kind of disperses the force a little more evenly if you guys don't have a foam roller we're on ours all the time we're just all the time we're just talking about how she was just on it this morning and so i'm going to leave another link in the description to this video if you do need a foam roller check out that link that's my favorite one and so what camille is going to do if it were her left piriformis she's going to sit on the foam roller she's going to cross her left leg other way left leg over her right to roll out that left side right hand is on her ankle left hand goes down on the floor back behind her and now we've got that left piriformis on stretch in this externally rotated position and then what she can proceed to do is kind of roll forward and backward she can roll her pelvis this way and that way kind of find and identify those areas that you're super tight and then that's where we want to spend a little bit of time foam rolling what i recommend here is about 60 seconds worth you can even kind of find that trigger point and just leave it there for a 60 seconds until that trigger point kind of melts away again if there's any pain or reproduction of symptoms down your legs that's indicative that you're actually aggravating that sciatic nerve we might want to back off this for now that's number one so the foam roller i like now again talking about surface area foam roller is a lot bigger there's a much bigger surface area for that if you want something a little more aggressive a tennis ball or a lacrosse ball can also do the trick what she can do is just sneak that under her butt again right on that piriformis muscle and a lot of times even that is going to be pretty intense and so again she's kind of just supporting herself with her hands and with her feet you roll around on that piriformis you find those areas of knots and those areas of tightness and again that's where i want you to stay if you can you knew it was coming you can also cross that left leg over that right leg again put that muscle on stretch and then roll it around and find areas of tension that way again about 60 seconds of these massage techniques are what i recommend all right so we've been through some of those self massage techniques to hopefully loosen up some of those some of those knots that you may be experiencing in that muscle let's show you now some good ideas or some good options on how to stretch it out i'm going to show you four stretches they're going to go kind of easiest to hardest or kind of least intense to most intense again depending on how bad yours is irritated depending on your hip mobility hopefully i show you something that's going to help you out and so camille we've got her laying down up here what she's going to do in order to stretch out this left piriformis muscle i'm going to have her straighten out her right leg and then all she's going to do is give this left knee a big hug she's going to pull it up towards her chest now if she takes her left knee and actually pulls it over towards her right shoulder we introduce a little bit of what we call horizontal abduction and that's going to help to just increase that distance or put a little more stretch on that muscle so that's your first version of your piriformis stretch take your knee whichever leg is affected and pull it over to your opposite shoulder now if that's pretty easy if you don't get too much of a stretch with that the next level would be she's going to come out of that bend both of your knees now she's going to cross her left leg over her right her hands come down right around the back of her leg now what she's doing is she's pulling this right knee straight up into her right shoulder but we're not stretching that right side again it's this one right over here so now we just increase the degree of that external rotation until she gets more of a stretch through that piriformis muscle that's number two now if that's still pretty easy or if you have even more hip mobility than that she's going to get up into what we call a pigeon pose in yoga and so again just a deep hip rotator stretch to get into it so again we're going to stretch out her left leg she's going to bring her left leg in front of her into kind of this 90 degree position so she's got about a 90 degree bend at her knee and then her right leg is going to go straight back behind her so now all of a sudden we get the weight of her body gravity acting straight down that's causing this hip to rotate even more to put even more of a stretch on that piriformis muscle again this one's probably the most intense if you are limited in your hip mobility like i there's a reason i brought her into this i kind of can't get into this position because i have some tight hip rotators and so this is probably the most aggressive but if you can get into it it's also a great way to stretch out that piriformis muscle okay go ahead and get out of that and now um again i mentioned in the introduction to this video one of the most common causes of this pain or a lot of the pain that i see a lot of times in my clinic would be pregnancy and pregnant women now the three stretches that i just showed you it's kind of difficult to get into that if you do have you know a pregnant belly going on case in point you kind of have the sciatica thing going on with our last so two pregnancies at least it might have been okay so the last three we've got four kids three out of the four have she had this sciatic nerve pain with a lot of it was due to that piriformis muscle tightness so this is how we stretched it out with her this is a little easier to get into with the pregnancy and so she would take her leg again the one that's affected and all you've got to do is stand at the edge of your bed your kitchen table couches are a little bit too low hopefully your bed's high enough some type of platform that's about this high she would bring her leg up into this position and now with a nice straight back she's going to lean forward until she feels a stretch come back up out of that if she was to simply round forward she can obviously go a lot further but a lot of that motion is coming from her upper back keep in mind that it's in the hips that we want to be moving and so keep your back nice and flat and then just lean forward on this and again she's a pro at this she did this one quite a bit again with our pregnancy so again four options for stretches again the goal being to alleviate some of that tension of that piriformis muscle that's that's pushing down on your sciatic nerve okay so the last thing we want to do so if you'll get back up here again sorry on your left side she's she's working hard on this one and so the last thing we want to do is introduce some strengthening exercises to that piriformis muscle so just some muscle activation in that area promote blood flow into that spot help it to release and relax a little bit more also to promote strength in that spot to alleviate some of the tension some of the stress in there the easiest thing to do is camille's gonna roll over onto her left side let's say for example it was her right leg that was affected and then with both of her knees bent we're going to do what we call a clamshell exercise so that piriformis is a hip rotator and so how we activate it is to go through hip rotation with both knees bent she's laying on her left side and what she's going to do is keep her feet together separate her knees so her right knee is going to pull up towards me and then come back down again we call these clam shells in the physical therapy clinic because you get this opening and closing again if it's her right leg that's affected this is working that right piriformis as she's going through this external rotation motion typically what i recommend to people is three sets of ten on this and then you're going to repeat that at least once a day twice a day if you can tolerate it i don't think i mentioned anything about my stretches my stretches i'll typically hold each one for 20 seconds repeat that three times and then the stretches you can also do a couple times a day as well so about 60 seconds on each of those stretches twice a day clamshells is your strength exercise number one strength exercise number two she's going to get up here onto all fours and a little bit more aggressive as now we're kind of going a little bit harder against gravity she's going to do what we call a well we call it a quadruped hip external rotation how lame is that it's called a fire hydrant you guys and so a fire hydrant exercise again down here on all fours and then she's going to take her bent leg keeping her hip at 90 keeping her knee at 90 and then she's going to raise that right knee up towards the ceiling and then slowly lower it back down again we're promoting that external rotation motion in the hip that's causing that piriformis muscle to fire that's exercise number two again a little bit more aggressive than your first one if you can tolerate clamshells you might try this if this is too aggressive go back to your clam shells and again about three sets of ten on those exercises how you feeling great that piriformis is like completely completely healed she's cured it's america hey you guys i hope you found this beneficial again my goal here was to show you some exercises that you can do to treat piriformis syndrome at home i hope you found it again hope you found it beneficial if you did go ahead and hit

        "video_sub_title": "okay so now we're gonna look at what to do when you've actually got those fluid-filled blisters generally the best advice is burst them yeah so what we're gonna do is we're gonna look at first of all let's say a blister on the back of the heel here yeah see this is all full of fluid now the thing we've got to do to this is we've got to get that fluid out and try and reattach the skin it will make it far more comfortable for you so the first thing you do is you get your alcohol swab which is probably gonna rub all this ink off so you get your alcohol swab you swab all over that blister area all around there make sure it's nice and clean then you get your your scissors and you clean the tips of those scissors and then you've got to think about where you're gonna put your incisions now because it's on the back of the heel that the force of causing this bliss is this this friction force like this so the best thing to do is to put two holes here and here so you get your little scissors if they're nice and sharp just carefully push them in to the blister push them into the blister then just drain the fluid off push that fluid away until that's nice and empty the reason we put the holes at the bottom here is that gravity will help let the fluid track down also as the foots pulling up in the shoe it will keep pushing that fluid away once that's nice and empty what you can do then is straight forward tape up the heel so what I'm going to be using here now is just a little bit of rock tape but like I said for free previously in other videos any tape will do zinc oxide anything at all we're going to look at rounding the edges of the tape off if you've got nice round edges of tape and the tape won't peel so you make sure you've got a piece of tape that's bigger than the bigger than the heel pick up on the blister on the heel sorry push on over that blister wrap it over the heel wrap it up the leg there's another piece that might just be fine but I'll just have another piece on here just to make sure don't put too much stretch on this tape at all you want it to be moving with the skin then you go remember with it you're using KT Tape Rock tape things like that is that you have to give the tape a good rub just to help keep the glue up and then it will add ear to the skin a lot better if your foots particularly sweaty before you put the tape on you can always put an adhesive spray like the opsite spray on there first to help you stick that on there",

        "video_sub_title": "hey there guys I'm just securing the traveling scientist and today we're going to be looking at gluten intolerance and celiac disease answering three key questions what are these conditions how can we deal with them and is it possible to cure them celiac disease is an autoimmune disease word of the day Auto meaning self autoimmunity is when your immune system attacks your own body in people with celiac disease the gut becomes sensitive to gluten which is found in foods like beer bread chips cereals and salsas things like that if you consume anything that contains gluten your body will produce an immune response in which the T cells attack your gut and the B cells produce antibodies against gluten which leads to intestinal inflammation and reduces your body's ability to absorb nutrients from food this can make you feel bloated it can make your stomach really hurt it can even give you diarrhea so it makes you crap and it makes you feel like crap approximately 1 in 100 people have celiac disease it's currently incurable disease which is caused by a number of factors including your genetics the bacteria in your gut and also the kinds of food you are fed when you're growing up if you have the genes that are common in celiac people that's HLA DQ - an HLA DQ 8 it's kind of like gluten stole your intestines high school girlfriend and your intestines never really forgave gluten so whenever gluten comes around your intestines kind of swell up and act like a dick to make gluten feel bad but it also leaves your gut feeling really bad and you can't really function properly so celiac disease is kind of like your gut hati on gluten does that make sense gluten sensitivity is slightly more common affecting around five to ten percent of people and it's defined by having similar symptoms to celiac disease but it doesn't have such a severe immune response on your small intestines so there's less damage to the gut but it still makes you feel like crap so if you have celiac disease gluten can make you feel extremely sick and malnourished but if you just have gluten intolerance gluten is just gonna make you feel pretty average so you're a glue what can you do about it well gluten comes from grains like barley wheat and rye and if you're a celiac or gluten intolerant you just need to avoid these sorts of foods there's no medication that can relieve the symptoms of gluten intolerance and celiac disease so the best thing you can do is to just prevent those symptoms by avoiding gluten altogether instead of eating pasta eat rice instead of eating normal bread eat gluten-free bread and instead of drinking beer you can just drink spirits sounds good huh I know that doesn't sound very fun right trying to avoid gluten for the rest of your life so let me tell you a little secret that might make you feel better scientists are currently working on a cure for these diseases that should alleviate the symptoms of gluten intolerance and celiac disease and it's gonna be available to the public in the next few years I'm predicting 2021 so that's gonna be sweet for you glute odds out there but until then avoid gluten yo anyway thanks so much for watching guys I really hope you enjoyed this video if you did click the like button down below and let me know what you think about gluten intolerance celiac disease in the comments section down below finally next week's video is going to be all about the gut microbiome talking about how our stomach can actually control our emotions so make sure you subscribe for travelling science every week I'll see you guys next time Sunday Cheers [Music] you",

        "video_title": "How long before I can run with a stress fracture",
        "video_sub_title": "Dok on the run we help injured runners run how long before I can run with a stress fracture well this is a great question this is the first question I get from runners when they get a stress fracture like a metatarsal stress fracture in the foot now this also of course could apply in large part to other kinds of stress fractures like a tibial stress fracture or a calcaneal stress fracture or any other stress fracture in your foot but the real question isn't like how long shot run everybody wants to think that it's like one answer like six weeks four weeks two weeks two days one answer that applies to everybody that of course is completely absurd I mean how long does it take for somebody to become a millionaire well that depends it depends on how much money you earn and it depends on what you do with that money right so if you make $300,000 a year but you buy a Lamborghini it's probably gonna take you longer to become a millionaire then somebody who invests all that money in the same thing with a healing process it depends on what you do it depends on what you put into your system it depends on what you do once you put those things into your system that all can affect your healing rate so you know we're gonna talk a little bit about this because it is really a valid question it's a question I get all the time and when a lecture at medical conferences on running injuries I get the same kinds of questions from doctors and later next week I'm going to be lecturing at the International Foot and Ankle foundation meeting in Lake Tahoe and I know doctors are gonna ask me the same questions that runners ask like how long should it take for this kind of injury how long should it take for that kind of injury before I can run and stress fractures are no exception they are one of the most common injuries that afflict runners and one of the things that keep runners from running more than anything else the short answer is this you can run as soon as the metatarsal bone has healed enough becomes stable enough to withstand the stress you apply to that bone when you run so I know that sounds sort of elementary but it's true the thing is is it all depends on you know like I said how fast you heal and what you do to reduce that stress the simple answer the doctors give you is don't run you know it's stressful when you run it's hard on the bone when you run and you you are running you caused a metatarsal stress fracture so if you keep doing that you're just gonna make it worse now that is true but that's not what I teach runners when I teach runners and what I teach doctors to teach runners is that you have to figure out how you can reduce the stress to that particular bone while you run so like I said if you really want to run you just have to wait until the bone stable enough to withstand whatever stress you're applying to it that doesn't always mean that you can't run but it does mean three things the first thing is that you have to let the bones strengthen in short you have to let it heal some but the healing process is a continuum of improvement that happens over a long period of time so initially you have the injury to the bone then you get some collagen forming stabilizing that little fracture in the bone and then that starts to calcify over time that it gets remodeled and become stronger and stronger and stronger over time you don't have to wait for the entire process to finish before you start using it you know you can basically increase your activity level as it gets stronger and stronger but you have to let that healing process begin and there are all kinds of things you can do that will improve or slow down that healing process so if you don't do anything different with your nutrition you don't sleep well you don't stay hydrated and you keep running on it or jumping rope or doing something that's applying too much stress to the bone well it's not going to heal so initially you need to protect it and you need to make sure that you're putting materials into your body that you need to rebuild that bone I know that sounds simple but it is simply true you have to do it so that's part of the stuff that we talk about throughout different lessons in the metatarsal stress fracture course about how to actually figure out what you need to do to build up that process of healing the bone and fortify that process so it can happen faster and the second thing you have to do is you have to reduce some of the stress to that bone when you run so if you're gonna run and you want to continue to run you have to reduce the stress there are lots of ways to do that you can do something as simple as running in a pool right that reduces the stress because it reduces the weight of gravity you can run on an alter G treadmill which is a fancy treadmill that reduces the force of gravity as you and you can program it to specific percentages or gravity you can use pads in your shoes to take pressure off of the injured bone and apply it somewhere else you can run on a surface that tilts your foot in a way that will actually reduce stress to that injured bone but you have to do something so if you keep running in the same way that injured the bone in the first place obviously that's not going to help the healing process that's going to hinder the healing process so you just have to really be thoughtful about this and figure out if you want to run that increases the stress level but how do you decrease the stress level to that particular bone so you can actually continue running without increasing the stress level applied to the bone when you run and then the third thing you have to do is you have to monitor it you have to pay real close attention for the signs that it's getting worse that you're actually re injuring the bone you have to look for things like pain swelling bruising they're all signs that you're re-entering the bone if you're running on it and you're ramping up you're running and then you get a huge bruise on your foot well what happened if you didn't drop a turkey on it something happened right so in all likelihood you actually crack the bone it bled under the skin and you saw a bruise so if you're running and you're getting bruising you know for sure you're making it worse though most runners don't take it that far but if you're running and you're getting an increase in swelling that means that you're actually applying too much force because you're having a rebound inflammatory response and you get extra fluid in the tissue and you see swelling same thing with paying if you're running and it hurts that is not a good sign that means you need to reduce the stress more so that it doesn't hurt because in all likelihood you're just applying too much force to that bone you're applying enough force that you're actually causing pain so there are lots of other indicators you can look at but you have to really monitor it very closely and systematically if you really want to continue to run and not make it worse but if you're really thoughtful about this if you're really careful if you're really paying attention if you're really diligent about doing all of these three things you can get back to running a whole lot sooner than the standard treatments often allow and the last thing a runner wants is to sit around in a fracture walking boot for a month and a half or two months like waiting for some magical process to happen where suddenly it's healed and now you can run because then if you do that once you get out of the fracture walking boot you get off of crutches or out of the wheelchair you're basically so weak and stiff you're more at risk of other overtraining injuries later and if your goal is really to do another race in a couple of months or four months or six months or even later this year well then that's a serious problem because you're gonna be so weak and stiff that it's gonna take you forever to ramp back up to your normal running fitness and during that process you may get reinjure with something else so remember you got to have three things that you got to do if you really want to get back to running sooner than the normal patient and when you go see your doctor don't just take some four week six week a timeline or you know sixteen weeks whatever they give you isn't the normal answer just to say well look if they say if it's 14 weeks for you're gonna run say what's that 14 weeks for me as a young healthy athlete or is that 14 weeks for like all the other old people I saw sitting in the waiting room is it as you tell everybody 14 weeks or is it only 14 weeks given my unique set of circumstances and then if that is true from my circumstances what can we do what can I do what can I do differently to speed up the healing reduce the stress on the bone so I can get back to running sooner you have to remember when you go to the doctor you got to ask the right questions if you want to get the right answers and just asking them what the way that they treat a fracture well that's not what you want you don't want the the way that they treat every other patient you want something individualized customized particularly for you so you can get back to running doc on the run we help injured runners run",

        "video_sub_title": "hey guys what's up just seeing here I'm once again couldn't keep this intro super short just like I did in my last video from this series if you guys don't know me my name is Justine I'm a nurse I've been working on the medical unit for three years now and I decided to start this new series on my channel which is gonna be comprised of four videos for now of educational skill so I'm basically teaching guys a couple of skills so so far I've done how to prime IV tubing we've done blood and today we're doing IVs which i think is the one that like everyone crunches and like everyone is most scared to do his IVs but you guys will see it super simple I had a couple hiccups if while I was doing this not because I don't know what I'm doing but just because you guys will see you guys let's do it I'm talking about but I also wanted to thanks Gil sheriff response doing this video once again I know it seems like you're sponsoring a lot of videos but I just thought that the videos of these sponsors will be a perfect fit for these like educational videos because if you guys don't know what Skillshare is it's basically an online learning community you guys have probably heard me talking about it more you probably know what I'm hearing me talk about it but I just you guys have to check it out it's amazing they have a bunch of like videos they have all different subjects you could be interested in thousands of thousands of videos creators it's people like you and me through the teaching and it's people that really know what they're talking about which is super awesome and I believe it's about ten dollars a month but if you guys do want to check it out check the link down below and you can get two months free just so you can try it out see if you like it you can cancel at any time no obligation and what was I gonna say yeah it's awesome because you could have it you can all have it like on land on your laptop because they also have an app and you can like save classes whenever you watch a class so like recommend other classes in that like same similar area I don't know I'm talking about I have too much caffeine today yeah just check out Skillshare it's amazing no obligation like I said cancel anytime but it is truly worth it okay now that I'm done all my rambling let's get started with the video all right so for your equipment you're gonna need your IV catheter and this one is a 22 gauge then you're going to need your IV tubing which you're going to connect to your IV catheter then you'll need a 3 cc syringe of normal saline you will need a Tegaderm I actually like to have to usually but only how to one today an alcohol swab Laura chlorhexidine swab a tourniquet and a two by two and a band-aid or tape so once again I like to always start by prepping my instruments or my whatever I need before putting on the tourniquet just to reduce the time that the turn of K is going to be on my patient so to do this I'm just opening my IV tubing and the inside I believe is sterile correct me if I'm wrong but I just like to prime my tubing so always always prime your tubing before you sit down your patient because it is full of air so you always want to prime it I think it's about like half a CC and then you'll see that little bubble of NS on the top and then the inside of the packaging I believe once again I should double check but I believe it's sterile so I just leave the opening and there you can always cap it if you feel more comfortable doing that then I open my Tegaderm and my band-aid last but not least my IV catheter and for IV catheters you have different sizes the smallest is a 22 which is this blue one then you have the 20 gauge which is pink 18 which is green I believe and 16 which is black then I'm using that some non sterile gloves this is not a sterile techniques you do not need sterile gloves then you're going to go ahead and put your turn account your patient thank you mom for being such a good sport I had some amazing guinea pigs with me this weekend so she had a very good antecubital vein so I'm just gonna clean it with this alcohol solution for about 15 I'll say 10 to 15 seconds feel free to palpate your vein once again if you need to just make sure you clean it afterwards so I'm gonna take off the cap off my IV catheter and I like to lift just to make sure see it like I'm doing there just to make sure that it is loose whenever I am going to be inserting it into my patient so always keep your skin taut keep your needle at a 10 to 15 degree angle and you want the bevel of your needle to be facing up you will see immediately if you have blood return push your catheter and pull back on the needle to make sure your blood return and there you go now one thing I should you should do is always remove your turn okay at this point which I did not do and another thing you should always do is make sure your tubing is connected properly to your needle so you don't get a big spill like I just did here I think it was just the nerves I'm drinking this on a family member I was off my game anyways make sure it's connected properly it's not a big deal you just can just clean it up and also the fact that I did not remove the tourniquet meant that blood it was back flowing into my syringe which is why the tubing is full of blood so how do I take it off my turn ek+ my mom has really good veins so the blood just like what ahead and did its own thing and I didn't have another and necessary I only had one so I couldn't flush the tubing properly but how do I had another syringe the tubing would have cleared and it would have just been NS and no blood so now I'm taking off my turn okay which is a bit late but that's okay and then I'm just going to take my Tegaderm now I like to have two I like to put one like in that position right there over my needle and then have another one to fold my tubing that way it doesn't get in the patient's weight now he didn't have to I only had one so I moved my little lock down so that I could arrange it in a way that my like the nada needle the catheter it was covered as well as the tubing just because it's less bothersome for the patient it's not like moving around and in their ways so preferably have to tag udders I did not have so I just have one and then always make sure you write the date I didn't do this for the purpose of this video but you should always write the date so that your colleagues can know when to change the IV so there you have it a nice antecubital IV with minimal complications alright guys so now I'm going to show you how to remove an IV because might as well right so obviously this one was super fresh so it wasn't stuck on the skin at all but if you have a patient that let you know it's been there for a while they've hairy skin just pull on your Tegaderm like I'm doing now and it'll loosen and it should hurt a lot less they'll keep removing the Tegaderm all around the catheter until you have just the catheter like nothing stuck fold your two by two and four and pop it on the insertion site and then just pull back and then your are going to want to deposit this into the sharps box which obviously I didn't have so I just like wrapped it in the paper towel and put it in the trash next you're gonna put your band-aid or your tape and last but not least as you will see here you're going to ask your patient once again to just keep pressure for about a minute to prevent any bleeding [Music]",

        "video_sub_title": "hey guys i'm ryan from best face forward and in today's video we're going to be talking about mouth breathing what causes it and how to fix it this is actually a very kind of deep issue for me because it's something that i've gone through for basically my whole life up until recently as i've worked with dr. esther Bulow so i know a lot about this i know a lot about what it can do to your energy levels and kind of making you tired and things like that though i really thought it was important to make this video so the three components of this video are going to be firstly why breathing through your nose is so important then we're going to talk about the difference between your tongue posture during the day and at night while you're sleeping and why that affects mouth breathing at night and then finally we're going to talk about the three things that cause you to mouth breathe at night and how you can begin to correct them we are designed to breathe through our noses when we breathe through our mouths there are several consequences first of all mouth breathing will cause you to have less energy be more dehydrated and potentially be more anxious your lungs extract oxygen from the air when you inhale as well as when you exhale when you breathe through your mouth it can cause over breathing which can cause you to lose too much carbon dioxide and essentially what ends up happening is there's less oxygenation to your organs now nasal breathing has also been shown to stimulate the lower lung which causes you to be calmer the slow nature of nasal breathing causes you to take deeper and slower breaths see the lower lung has parasympathetic nerve receptors which are associated with relaxing calming the body and mind Oh what does this all mean it means that by breathing through your nose you're gonna be overall healthier you're gonna be less tired you're going to be more hydrated and you're gonna be more relaxed have less stress and anxiety can share personally with me this did happen when I started breathing through my nose so I can remember being tired a lot of the time and I do the first time that I actually breathe through my nose and woke up after a full night of breathing through my nose entire lethargic body feeling where my whole face and body just felt relaxed because that's what breathing through your nose causes what is the difference between during the day and at night when it comes to mouth breathing and your tongue posture well obviously during the day you can kind of force your mouth closed and force yourself to breathe through your nose however if it's uncomfortable for you at night when you become unconscious those muscles will relax and if you don't have adequate airway room or space then what's gonna happen is you're going to have to breathe through your mouth because obviously you need to breathe so how can you determine if your mouth breathing at night if you're saying am i mouth breathing at night if you are you'll probably know and the real reason is because well first of all you'll be tired you'll be lethargic the next day so when you wake up if you've ever melt breathe before when you're sick or we're a stuffed nose or something you probably notice that your melt was really really dry like not just a little bit like really dry so now dr. Esther Bulow is going to talk about why you could be mouth breathing why this may be happening and how you could go about correcting it if this issue is happening to you or somebody you know so he's gonna talk about that I see that people breathe through their mouth when they asleep that's because they don't have enough airway patent airway to breathe through their nose so normally we breathe through our nose but why is it that people other people breathe through their mouth and the airway is not as open or as patent what happen is people do out to the stars to constrict and as it constricts like that if the mouth is closed what happened is the tongue doesn't have any place to go so the first thing you will do is you will move backwards the tongue now will increase the airway even more by doing that they'll have difficulty of breathing what are the what's going to happen next they have to open their mouth or else they can't breathe they start breathing better and one of the that you will see when people are breathing through the mouth they are also for the most part snoring or the worst part is does start getting into apnea so if your mouth breathing and you want to correct this issue now you know it's probably because of your airway so the question to ask is what is blocking your airway is it something that's possibly temporary such as allergies you might have enlarged adenoids you might have something that's temporarily blocking your airway in which case if you were to clear that out by seeing an ear nose and throat specialist or something you might be able to clear up that issue the second question is it an issue of tongue space if it is an issue of tongue space what you might have is you might have a maxilla or an upper jaw and the lower jaw that's too small to support your tongue so as dr. Esther Beale explained it's going to fall back into your airway in that case obviously you would need to seek professional help to try and get expansion or something done but there is a third case in the third case you could have poor tongue posture due to lack of tongue strength so by doing myofunctional therapy and tongue exercises even by mewing you could improve your posture improve your tongue posture to get your tongue up and forwards on your palate which will make more room for your airway I know from experience that by doing these exercises it's allowed me to mouth breathe to stop mouth breathing at night so we've actually created a quick PDF guide that's going to give you an overview on tongue posture how to improve your posture your tongue and your lip seal to improve your tongue posture so if you want to get that you can go into the link in my bio and you can download that PDF guide you",

        "video_sub_title": "welcome to the instructional video on proper care of surgical drains in this video you will learn the steps to properly strip an empty or surgical drain at home first we will demonstrate shipping the drain using a to be back drain stripper and then we will demonstrate the procedure using an alcohol pad also learn what to watch out for when caring for your surgical drains and what to do should complications arise good morning mrs. Smith I'm here to teach you how to take care of your surgical drain do you remember the purpose of your surgical drain yes it prevents food from building up and allows tissue to heal that's great mrs. Smith before we begin you're going to want to get into a comfortable position and have all of your supplies on hand you will need a tuba vectoring stripper an alcohol pad and a measuring device it's not necessary for you or your caregiver to wear gloves when you're at home caring for your dreams but you do need to wash your hands thoroughly before and after handling the drain the tube of back is a device used to remove clots and other material that get caught in your surgical drain system to begin line up the tubing in the groove of the tube evacs drain stripper with your other hand close to where the tubing exits your body pinch the drain tubing then to strip the drain close the tuba vac drain stripper over the tubing hold your other hand tightly and begin to move down the tubing you can also use an alcohol pad again hold the tubing close to where it exits the body wrap the alcohol pad around the drain tubing pinch and pull to strip the tubing you may see and feel fluid moving back and forth through the tubing and that's completely normal as you move all the way down the tubing you're clearing any clots of material from getting caught in your surgical drain system we always hold the tubing close to the body to prevent unnecessary tugging that can be painful to the patient now that you've washed your hands it is your turn please show me how to use the drain stripper and the alcohol pad your next step is to empty the drain you'll need to empty your drain at least three times a day or more if needed hold your bulb securely in your hands take the plug off the top of the bulb and let it expand you'll dump the Jaypee bulb over the measuring cup and gently squeeze the fluid out some fluid may still be left in the bulb and that's okay be careful not to touch where the plug inserts into the bulb or the plug tip itself after emptying the fluid squeeze the middle of the bulb and replace the plug while still squeezing keep the ball away from your face while compressing the bulb should always be compressed like this to work properly each time you empty the bulb measure the amount and note the color of the fluid rated on the JP drain record sheet that you will be given before discharge if you have more than one drain keep a separate record for each one empty the fluid into the toilet and flush rinse your measuring cup and wash your hands with soap and water every 24 hours add up the total amount of fluid you drain from each bulb you may shower two days after surgery the drain site should be cleaned and redressed daily follow your doctor's specific instructions on how to do this always secure the drain properly for showering hang it around your neck after showering you may hang it around your neck or pin it to your clothing you said I should have did to drain three times opinion when needed are there any problems I should be looking out for that's a great question potential problems may include all of the following any signs of infection this may include redness of the drain site and increase in body temperature a fever cloudy fluid or fluid that has a bad odor you might also develop a humid to mow which is a collection of blood that builds up under the skin close to your surgery site treatment depends on the location and the size of the hematoma but usually involves draining the accumulated blood hematomas can be painful and hard to the touch you may also get a seroma this is a collection of fluid that may develop at the surgical site after surgery usually the seroma is left to heal on its own the body reabsorbs the fluid and thus aroma shrinks with some patients this aroma becomes too big for the body to reabsorb and becomes necessary to drain the fluid if you develop any of these complications please call the clinic their phone number is located on your discharge paperwork can you tell me when your surgical drain will be removed by your nurse or doctor its you to remove 20 to 30 CC's two tablespoons or less for two straight days in a row this can happen at the first post-op appointment or it may take up to three weeks yes that's correct when your surgical drain is removed you can still shower but you will not be allowed to soak in a tub or swim until it's okay by your doctor that old drain site may take a couple days to fully close and it may use a little fluid and that's all normal you want to keep that drain site clean and dry if you notice any swelling sometimes this is a collection of fluid called a seroma and that requires medical attention so you're going to want to contact the clinic office as soon as possible if you have had reconstruction such as tissue expanders or tram flap please contact your plastic surgery team first if you have any questions or concerns about your surgical dreams wound care and biotic or pain medications in this video you learn the steps to properly care for your surgical drain at home you also learn the signs and symptoms to watch out for as well as what to do as complications arise your nurse may ask you to repeat the steps you learned on this video to ensure everyone can properly care for your surgical drain at home this concludes the instructional video on proper care of your surgical drain",

        "video_title": "How to use an epinephrine autoinjector",
        "video_sub_title": "so today I'm going to teach you how to use a nap I'm going to show you a real one first and then we'll practice with the trainer so the EpiPen is doing what it is actually it's a shot of epinephrine right and an epinephrine is adrenaline so it's going to give you the side effects of adrenaline it's going to make your heart rate go up and your blood pressure go up and make you feel jittery those are the major side effects of it but it's also the purpose of it and those side effects don't last very long so this is the real one and I just wanted to show it comes in this hard plastic case and you slide it out of the case like that I'm going to show you specifically how to give it with the trainer but on this there's a few little nuances to this that are not on the trainer so it has this window here this window is the epinephrine if there was a red shade down that would mean that it had like auto injected into your case and you wouldn't be able to use it so if there's a wet red shade it's no longer good this medicine is heat sensitive light sensitive and coal sensitive so it really has to come in and out of the house not leave left in a car not left outside for prolonged periods it has to stay pretty neutral but because it is light sensitive coal sensitive and heat sensitive sometimes the medication is destroyed by those extremes and temperature one of the things if you ever look in that window and you see that it is really it is actually a little bit opaque but if it's really cloudy or it has anything precipitate some things floating around in it or if it's brown it's really no good to use and you'd need to use another one I will yes throw it away so check them periodically it's a good idea I will say if it's all you had I would use it if you were somewhere and you had no other option I would use it and call nine-one-one you give the EPI first and then you call 9-1-1 also in the real one is both the lot number and the expiration date keep it within expiration date when you pick them up from the pharmacy we always tell our patients it should last you a year so if you if they're giving you one that six months exploration ask them for another one it's really it should last you a year and then the lot number in case it was any kind of recall or anything you want to be familiar with with a lot number is so that's the real one we're going to put this one away so that we can play with the trainer so this is the trainer I put them in the plastic case just to show people when you get a trainer it's not in the plastic case so what I are you a righty yes okay so what I have people do is slide it out into their hand like a fist and never change that position it's going to go anywhere in your outer thigh and it's made to go through clothing if you have to but if you're you know if you can administer it directly into the skin that's fine it isn't it's made to go through jeans as well I just feel like if you can see the the skin then you're going to be really confident that everything is done correctly but if you're somewhere where you can't take your pants down or whatever go ahead and administer it through it's it's made to go through the clothing so hold it like a fist the cap has to come off to activate this if you don't take this cap off it's not going to work nothing's gonna happen you don't come out correct the cap has to come out for that so this is one of the reasons why I want you to hold it like this because people just instinctively want to put their thumb there and you're not going to remember to take the cap off also if you do take the cap off and you put your thumb there it may not allow the device to work correctly but the biggest reason is sometimes people have it this way and they put their thumb on the needle end and they will get injected through their thumb and it really does happen so we want you to be really careful and hold it like in this disposition so I always tell people don't take the cap off until it's really close to your thigh because if you're about to give yourself an EpiPen because you're you've having a food allergy reaction and you may be having some difficulty breathing our vomiting are you know really feeling badly if you take it off you can accidentally inject yourself in a hand and an arm we want it to go in the thigh because this big muscle it's really vascular it has a good blood supply and it suck that up and Efrain really fast and you know spreads it through your system so that you can be treated so you're going to hold it like that take the cap off closer to the thigh take this off and then go one two three and you hear it click you have to hear it click you'll feel the injection and it has a little bit of a kickback meaning that it's under pressure so it can bounce out so you want to make sure you're holding it really tight firmly in place and then you hold it in place for 10 seconds and that's you know probably the hardest part it's holding in place for 10 seconds okay and then when you pull it out this plastic sheath will cover the needle and you'll never see the needle with this device you don't have to worry about sticking yourself after it's taken out of your thigh you don't have to worry about somebody else getting stuck with it because it's going to be protect the needle will be covered and protected it isn't necessary to do a big swinging action into your thigh to activate this device it really isn't you can do it just a few inches away and get it to work perfectly fine why don't actually we'll do it from the real beginning here so when I have you go ahead and do that so you're feeling like that you need the EpiPen and when you feel like you need it you're going to give it there you go nice fist take the cap off and go ahead and inject it great and hold it in place for 10 seconds pull it out that's it and the reason why you want to hold it in place for so long is that people's their their instinct is to you know inject and pull it right back out again this is a one shot device if you pull it out you're going to lose the device the medicine it's just going to come you know into the air and you don't have the chance to give it again with that particular EpiPen you'd have to use another one so that's why we say hold in place for such a long time then we're sure you got it okay the epi pens come as a 2-pack now this is was from the hospital so that's why it's a single pack but even in the hospital now I get them as a two pack they're only dispensed as a two pack and the two packs also come with the trainer this particular trainer you want to keep the two pack as a 2 pack don't separate them so that you're carrying two epi pens and there's lots of reasons why you want to have two one is that say the device would add malfunctioned into the in the case and if you only had one you wouldn't have another one to give if somebody was helping you administer it and they accidentally got injected with it which does happen then you wouldn't have a dose so it's another reason to have a backup sometimes like if you injected it and bounced out because you weren't holding them firmly in place and you've lost the chance then you still have another one to give and sometimes people need additional epinephrine and that's you know really the last reason why you want to have to and you can give another one as soon as five minutes so you give the first one and you call them on one or someone's called 9-1-1 and you're waiting for the emergency medical system to come and help you and you're still getting worse you can give another one as soon as five minutes and you can give it at any interval after that as well but as soon as five minutes you knows a little more cumbersome to carry too but again you know you probably have a pocketbook everywhere you go most likely or backpack and just keep those those two together when in doubt give it and you know anytime just if you think I think I really should give it just do it there was really no harm in giving it other than you do have to go to the emergency room a delay in giving it is where people run into problems so we don't need to wait for like big terrible symptoms we want you to give it as soon as you're feeling symptoms okay that was great",

        "video_sub_title": "[Music] okay I've been working on the craftsman installing the plow and kind of if I was kind of lucky to find some of the instruction manuals for assembly so I could kind of make heads or tails well with this because the previous owner to plow kind of regular up to their liking as parts broke instead of replacing them wherever they were just sort of rig something up like they did with this this piece right here and I'll get into that later with that this floor but um anyway there isn't much as far as installation is most of the videos that I've seen are shown afterwards after it are installed or they just kind of forget about I was showing how its installed so this this is going to kind of take you from step on but this here is it's an assemble channel frame here there's an angle with three holes in it and they've bolt right up to the craftsman frame using the first hole here in the back slotted area here the center center bolt isn't used just this bolt here and that boat there and it's threaded so I didn't need a mess file with what it Brown with any nuts in the background or anything like that then there's a couple of bars that's a couple of bars that are attached to the front / they're already assembled so you can see that there is an angle actually bolts to the bottom of that it's on that side and then there is a plate that bolts to this this piece right here so it makes a real sturdy a little sturdy frame so that's a it's about it on there the rest of it I am missing some parts one thing here is this is the lift handle here you can see it there and there should be a rod that goes from here to here on the plow and that's missing so I either have to fabricate one or see if I can buy that part probably alone and it's a probably on 20 bucks for it this guy had to be for use the chain probably just lift it this here connects this tubing to this bar which is actually lifts the plow up and I think that's probably broken broke off the head on that somebody have to try to get that out of there figure another way to attach it there is a should be a cable with a lock handle at the top of that of this tube right here which is missing and that would connect to this here which would which would lift it and as this turns to the play you can see the notch is three notches there it'll much it'll the necklace one of the not just could slaying it to this double bar here and rock it in place the other thing is that that other handle up there would actually could actually lock the plow in an upper position in other words I'd have to hold it so I have to come up with something for that instead of trying to hold this follow-up which can get heavy with snow on it that's what this piece of wood is for I'm going to get rid of that and I probably what I'm going to do is use some other type of rod up here with a handle on it so I can pivot it and lock the angle of the blade so that's about it or this craftsman I have a little bit of time I don't think it's going to snow overnight so I'm either gonna try to order some parts or fabricate some of my own my biggest problem too I think will be is trying to lock that blade in an upright position with some way to hold it which I think craftsman probably was a bad design that begin with it's probably kind of flimsy but try to hold the blade up like this let's see what some snow on it that's it now I'll probably do one more video on this thanks for watching commenting and subscribing",

        "video_title": "My Hair Extension Collection/Care!",
        "video_sub_title": "hey guys so in this video I'm gonna be showing you my hair extension collection because it was quite highly requested on one of my other videos on the thumbs up fun I'm gonna be showing you the history behind each start of hair extensions and how I look after them yeah these are my first set of hair extensions the the wefts are quite disgusting now because they were clip ons and I took the clips off and then I started to glue them in my hair because they used to last longer but then I found my scalp would get really itchy from where their shampoo wasn't cleaning properly and so then I took them out but yeah they started off as bleach blonde and I bought these ones from Sally's then I dyed them cat pee blue so these were the ones in my dyeing my hair blue video so I dyed them cat pre blue and then when they faded I put pink on top which turns and purple and the ends they're not as bad as what these Anne's are but they're much shorter than what I'm wearing now because of trimming because you have to keep them ready trim for each like full set of hair my head I probably have about ten pieces and this one's 12:12 pieces so these are my first step and then I these ones I think I bought these ones some Sally's as well I bought these ones in blonde and I think I dyed them pink then I dyed them something else and something else and then eventually I don't oh yes that's it so I dyed them pink and then I died there move around and then I dyed them black so and these ones have still got the clips on because I don't really want to destroy the weft like these have because it's a gunky so these ones are still got the clips on some clips are blonde or some clips of brown because I mix them match but when they're in your hair you can't really see the colored of the color of the clips so I like to mix and match my hair extensions sometimes I like to put either some odd ones in just to like create different colors so I don't always have to keep dying my natural hair pieces of black hair extensions and these ones much shorter so I used to I used to have quite sure and only just recently gone extra long the ones I'm wearing ah a 20 inch from the website on my extension hair extension video and these ones are just can't pin that the mainland but I won't be gluing them in but I'm not quite sure if I'm ready to do that yet because I don't really want to just destroy the work of the half and these ones are another set of hair extensions I thought I think I bought these ones of he bakes and these ones were in blonde and I did glue these ones in as well so all the wefts are kind of disgusting you can re so the clips back on and use them again and we get all the glue off but then it it feels quite like on your head and you feel really itchy because of the glue so this is probably why I don't really wear these ones anymore because of the glue and I really can't be asked to so the clips back on so I normally just buy a new set every time but I do make them last I always buy it in blonde and then if you can dye over the color that's already on them that's what I do so I could either dye black on top of this or turn them purple by putting a video on top or dip dyeing the tips so you can reuse the hair extension that's quite a lot that I just choose to buy new hair because it does get quite damaged sometimes and then there is also this which was an experiment this one was a pack of a pack of hair extensions from Sally's and I am making new blonde but I wanted to try out one of my hair colors that I bought in the post and this was a cat pre blue and then I decided to just do tails but I did show this in one of my previous videos about a year ago but I could put it back in and I could move them back in but these ones haven't got clip on these ones haven't used yet because they look kind of weird all the hair extensions I've got at the moment I will probably buy some more pink ones strips purple ones that were also blue and black ones that were also brown and some other fellow excluding the ones I'm wearing as well what I did to look after them is when I'm not wearing them in my head because that would be an awful lot of hair poink even though when I'm not wearing these I store them and just well I've had this envelope for quite a long time but I just draw them I'm just a paper envelope and then just fold them over make sure they're brushed and everything before you put them in just fold them over like that in a loop I got quite a lot of use out of these hair extensions so it's not like I haven't looked after them but yeah I wash them regularly probably about once or twice a week I over leave them in or just take them out wash them a normal shampoo and then rinse them through and then I completely soaked them like drench them in conditioner always the ends get quite damaged as soon as the hair extensions always get straightened or cold all that this is the conditioner I use in the hair extensions so it's a Tresemme thermal recovery advanced technology so not salon performance replenishes with rope burns aloe vera and almond extract conditioner for heat damaged hair so I find this one is the best for hair extensions and then I use the repair resume 80% breakage conditioner for my natural hair the natural has a delicate than weak the hair extensions I say so the thermal ones definitely good for hair extensions because of the heat products when I'm straightening my hair I use this heat protection spray and I find it really helps and it stops it from going frizzy and it's by Lee Stafford it's in a pink bottle and it's focused straight flat iron protection shine mist and this one's pretty good I bought this one like it's subtract anywhere really that's about it guys so you've seen my hat extension it's been my conditioner that I use for the hair extensions and the heat protection spray that I use at the hair touches these hair extensions all these hair extensions have lasted me a year so it's been almost exactly a year since I started to buy hair extensions I had quite long hair and I didn't really see the point in wearing hair extensions but when you're bleaching your hair all the time you lose a lot of length now my house this this shop and it used to be that long yeah it used to be so hair extensions kind of hide the fact that I've reached out my hair and and I covered it up if you look after them they will last you a very long time they last you as long as your normal hair on your head but you're constantly ripping them with combs like I brushed them through with my white teeth comb like this brush them food if you constantly rip the bare bones of break and the end is about to get quite like it to make sure you brush and delicately so they're always nice and soft and just condition them regularly and they should be fine but if you like treat them like and leave them on the side of your dressing table for a week and they've just got laser dust on them and those ratty and you don't wash them and they've got smoking back to climate change chemicals in them then they're bound to just get really if you're willing to spend money on hair extensions and you can afford to buy a set each time you want to buy them to save money you can just read eye them or just stick with the ones you've got so I hope you enjoy my hair extension collection video I know it's not extreme like I haven't got a whole wardrobe full of hair extensions but I am quite eco-friendly and I do like to reuse things are quite a lot saying four sets of hair extensions within the past year is quite good considering I've dyed my hair almost every week I hope you enjoyed this video don't forget to Like subscribe and comment bye guys",

        "video_sub_title": "okay guys Mike from where Bo's let's do part two of the Osage bill Wong that we've been doing what I've done is the bow is the stave is in the same place it was when I got came at you last time except I've removed the shellac or lacquer or whatever the guy sealed the bow with who sold me this piece of wood if they'll remember or what the there is some remaining shellac lacquer whatever it is from my original video I've just sort of scraped off the remainder and the guy who sells me these B staves he says he takes them down to a singular growth ring and I always like to check his work and make sure that that's the case and usually it is or at least it's a good college try but let's let's take a look sometimes it can't be helped in order to get the lacquer off you're going to break through a growth ring as is the case here now you can see here's one growth ring here's the what I've always called the spongy layer now it's not as much as its early growth and late growth but I still like calling it the spongy layer because it looks like a sponge to me and I think when I described it that way to people they understand it better so I'm going to stick with it I hope you guys will forgive me for that but here it is here's the the ring the sort of white spongy layer in between then in the center there you can see the new growth ring that lies beneath now if that were the only place it broke through in the whole stave I wouldn't worry about it because it's over my what's going to be my riser and that doesn't Bend so there's really no chance of something like that failing on me as I continue this build until her and you know everything else but there was another one as you can see right here here again we have the single growth ring on top the what I call the spongy layer here which is actually the early growth layer I've got a lot of criticism for calling it a spongy layer which is where I'm talking here and then the single growth ring beneath so this one is still kind of over an area where I would call it the fade-out but it could be over the end the beginnings of my working limb and frankly I think I might as well just take it down it seems to be the only place on this bow where the growth ring has been violated in any significant way let's go over how I would it's a good opportunity for me to just I liked reducing down to single growth rings anyway it's just part of the process I enjoy so let me go over it again I know I've gone over it before if you guys have watched my videos before but let's go over it again I take a scraper this is people always ask me what scrapers I use this is from Ace Hardware guys and the this particular model is called I guess hide the main thing you can I have another one you know I'll get the other one the other one I use is the same in the same scraper world here's the other one it doesn't have a brand name on it I don't even know what what brand it is but the most important thing about the scraper is that it's got this this blade in here this this is a removable it's not particularly sharp and it's two sides so when this side wears out you can flip it to this side and obviously if you know how to sharpen these things great if you don't you can just buy a replacement blade start over again the replacement blades are not cheap they're almost I think I think this whole shooting match is about 20 bucks the replacement blades are like 8 bucks apiece so it's better if you can sharpen them but if you're someone who has the problem of sharpening knives and other things like I do end up spending some money but they last I have never bought a replacement blade for this and I've had it for about two years done a lot of bows and I have I flipped the blade so I'm getting close to that replacement time but you know anyway they're great scrapers I really like them and the way I way I go about reducing the growth room as I find the spot where I just pick a spot anywhere on the bow or I find a spot where the growth ring was violated that looks like the place I want to get the next growth ring and I just start scraping across so I have it going the entire width of the bow and you can see as I go I reveal more now this is a very very shallow let's look at the end here you can see I don't have a lot of room tremendous amount of room to work with here the growth ring on top and I think that is the early so I have this big space here on this side to work with going over here it's pretty thin so I got to be careful so I'm going to do that I'm gonna try to do this and keep it in the camera at the same time for you guys here I'm just going to be gentle and try to get this thing going you know what let me see if I can put all right so let's do this again see if I can keep it in the camera here makes it a little easier for me if I have two hands you'd be a little more sensitive to this whole thing now pretty well exposed this growth ring here interesting two-tone thing going on here that's still only one growth ring though but it's got this sort of no maybe it's no it's just a weird thing let's just get to it do something bet here phille don't want to violate another growth ring that would be bad all right almost there you can see that yes you can all right now something you got to watch out for is the wood isn't always rounded it sometimes has valleys in it sometimes has you shapes in it you can really throw you for a loop because you don't see it coming what you need when that happens is a different kind of scrape flat scrapers are great sometimes what you need is a rounded scraper like this this is a cabinet scraping tool and what happens is you have these divots in in the wood your flat scraper will keep scraping on either side of it it'll miss this part and by the time you dig deep enough to get this part these have violated growth rings on either side so you take your little scraper like yeh and you put it in the depression and now you can scrape away that that extra little piece without violating the growth ring on either side it's just another way of doing the same it does the o it does the other stuff too but see now I got in that little divot that little depression I haven't I haven't violated any growth rings and if you needed to pinpoint something is the rounded aspect can be a little more accurate this is also really good when you work around knots so let's go to a knot and you see I didn't get all the lacquer off now this knot is actually I believe going to be part of my static wind so I'm not so worried about it but just give you another example of how effective these round see I scraped the wood here over the nut here but this valley in here still has lacquer in the valley so I'm going to get that off same way using the rounded piece I'm going to try to get all that extra stuff out that I couldn't get out with a straight edge scrape this is also how you reduce to a single growth ring around knots it's get a rounded scraper and you'll find that the knots are no longer an issue because your scraper is actually getting into the grooves where you needed to get into to get that single growth ring whereas it couldn't get in before with the with a straight edge scraper okay so basically you get the idea there so the next thing I do is I either will follow this is my new beautiful unmarked growth ring now I can take the scraper and the rounded scraper and work my way down both sides but save a little time I take out the draw knife and I just try to get the blade under that spongy layer and I just pull little curls away and it will go to see how much I can take off now it will go significantly faster as long as I stay inside that the spongy layer likes to give it goes away easily it like it's very crunchy it likes to be pulled up problem is you can very easily cut through multiple growth rings if you catch something the wrong way so take your time be careful here and you can see how quickly this is happening now I'll give you a shot of this whole area in a minute and if you run into another one of those depressions we're even even though this is rounded a bit if you come into that area with a depression you can always come back with your scream leave it you can always come back with your rounded scraper later see I got one right here I got a rounded area right there right here see how that you can even kind of see how the wood goes up you know into like a valley even this isn't really and if I dig in after this right here there's a good chance I'm going to violate the growth room so I get it along the edge a little bit and then I'll just continue up here you know just let it go come back to it with the with a rounded scraper and I'll just do this the entire length of the bow until I have a nice alright let's look at the whole area now now I started about where'd I start I started here and you can see I've taken all the entire growth ring off except for some of that early growth or that spongy layers I like to call it and this whole area is now pretty much a single growth ring once I get that extra little you know scraps off with this with the rounded scraper I don't go too hard with the with the draw knife you don't have to it saves you a ton of time so when you come back and do your touch-up with the scraper you're going to be in great shape so that's basically just do that with the whole bow and you will have reduced to a beautiful single growth ring in no time all right so here's our old growth ring that we got rid of the spongy layer the just a little remnant of spongy layer new growth ring beautiful smooth nice fibers new growth ring down to an area with more spongy layer growing back into our old growth ring and basically I want the whole bow to look like that and when I do that I will have the strongest self backing possible in a bow of course I'm still gonna back it but that's just because I'm all about more is better when it comes to strength of a bow all right guys that's Mike from boyar bows that's our video today that's where I am in my part of the build one so sorry it took so long between videos but I'll try to speed up the process a little bit for the next one all right take care guys talk to you soon",

        "video_sub_title": "hey Cindy it's Jen listen I just heard you guys are going to fish guard this weekend it's gonna be so much fun just call me from your car if you get a chance just want to catch up with you see ya it was a Friday morning and my husband Tim had been going to a conference in Las Vegas he took the red-eye flight home and got home Friday morning for the load in the car getting ready to go pick up our daughter from school to go to Busch Gardens for the weekend all of a sudden it felt like I had been shot in the head just a sudden pop of just excruciating pain in my head then a sudden stiffness in my neck and dizziness and sudden tingling in my feet I could feel it all over I knew it was an emergency I needed him to call my name and lights to come when someone comes in grabbing their head saying it's the worst headache of their life most physician that rings a bell that this is an aneurysm it's when it's more subtle they may have felt dizzy they may have had as a warning leak maybe as subtle as feeling an extreme and when that is suspected it has to be pursued by a physician to figure out if indeed they have had Amerige frequently they'll think well this is a migraine or a cluster headache it's officially designed a necessity sometimes they'll refer to them as oh it's a sinusitis give them antibiotics in them on their way and I've even seen one case where it was misdiagnosed as a cervical disc herniation is the patient had some neck and arm pain that's really enough it's not your head because emergency room see common things often headaches from ear infections headaches from gastroenteritis from viral syndromes from hypertensive emergencies things like that those are those tend to be the very common types of misdiagnosis there are a laundry list actually of misdiagnosis for this both in terms of patients and physicians they include sinusitis the flu things as simple as that drug intoxication can be confused with subarachnoid hemorrhage emergency room physicians see patients who are intoxicated all the time in fact they see regular offenders of drug intoxication and you have to keep in mind that sometimes it's not a drug intoxication if there's any asymmetry in there at neurologic exam or some unusual that doesn't fit for the diagnosis of the drug intoxication subarachnoid hemorrhage or intracranial hemorrhage needs to be considered so someone comes in with a headache someone comes in and has a little redness in their eardrum and this had a headache or some sort of a typical headache pattern and they'll be given that diagnosis so otitis media gastroenteritis GI disturbances dehydration hypertensive emergencies myocardial emergencies those types of things are common and therefore used a lot as diagnosis when in fact subarachnoid hemorrhages are woven in those diagnoses or woven in those patients around those diagnoses and ers I think it's not keeping a high index of suspicion as a physician you see someone in the emergency room comes in and they have that history of a sudden explosive headache people don't want to think oh this could be an aneurysm so they're gonna try to go with the more common entities oh it's a sinus infection it's a migraine it's a cluster headache I've even seen cases where they refer to there's some associate neck pain so they think it's a disk herniation or problem with the general spine disease and it's that lack of clinical suspicion even if you remotely think it's a possibility you need to bring it up to the top of your list and do the appropriate workup because if it is a sentinel bleed and it's missed the results can be catastrophic to the tumor and those are the sad ones that we see because I will see cases and review cases quite often where patients will come in and they'll say well this is a hypertensive crisis take your blood pressure medication follow up with your doctor and we'll go from there a few days later the patient comes in as a foreman and hemorrhage these are the types of things that we'd like to try to capture and the rate the way that you do that is to just simply keep aneurysmal hemorrhage in the differential diagnosis the brain aneurism Foundation was a resource that we found to be so helpful we found just being educated through their website and their resources was incredibly helpful I'd like to say thank you to the brain aneurysm foundation for their efforts to spread the importance of early detection to the medical professional community without question the brain aneurism foundation and efforts to raise awareness of brain aneurysm diagnosis and treatment are very important parts of lowering the risk of stroke and the mortality associated with stroke I'm just thankful that they're there and they're reaching out to families to be a resource as well as the medical community and I'm thankful for the fact that they're getting out this message of early detection early treatment and helping the medical community understand how to spot it and hopefully save lives that's what this is all about I really feel like I was one of the lucky few to make it to the hospital and for the doctors to diagnose early that it was a brain aneurysm and I made it through because of that but a lot of people don't it's not diagnosed fast enough and they don't make it so many people die from this that don't have to if they only were diagnosed correctly and early and got the treatment that they need their outcomes are gonna be so much better and we're talking about real people here these are moms and dads grandmothers grandparents children of parents can be saved there are so many families that aren't as lucky as we were that the children don't have their mommies to grow up with and maybe if they would have just been diagnosed early they'd still be here you",

simple non drug treatment for fibromyalgia and rheumatoid arthritis I'm gonna tell you why this came about Brad and this could be just regular arthritis as well actually for a lot of different pains sure is a simple treatment I was at a funeral yesterday unfortunately a friend of mine his younger brother passed away he said seizures his whole life anyway my aunt was there and I don't want to say her name I don't know if she wants her name of it yes yeah whatever you think that could stand for my aunt is having problems with a lot of things unfortunately and she's two of the things she's having trouble with that fibromyalgia and rheumatoid that's right so she's having a lot of pain and I wanted to give her some relief so we're gonna go ahead and send her a thermal text okay far infrared system heating system here so by the way before we go into that let's talk about if you are new north oh yes please take a second to subscribe to us we provide videos how stay healthy fit pain free we upload everyday also you're gonna want to go to the Facebook and like us Bob and Brad because we're giving away stuff for the next model of four or five Sundays in a row we start on Sunday it runs all week and then on the next Sunday we actually named the winner okay so we're giving away mattresses we're giving away a thermal text we may have given the way already by the time this gets posted sure but we're giving away some foam rollers we're get lots of cool stuff so go on the Facebook and they'll yeah there's a lot to push on yeah there's actually on YouTube too you can find it down below oh yeah so alright so yeah the solution here that I must say I was trying to think what one thing could help her cuz you know with that type of diagnosis with rheumatoid arthritis at five Maya you can get pain in all your joints you can have pain and all the muscles right so you know I thought you know a good passive way to treat it you know you cuz I was thinking about a massager but sometimes a massager is too much too aggressive and you have to be active with it then you have to you know use it right so I I thought you know we'd send her a thermo text because the thermo text you can use it pretty much on every part of the body especially the platinum model right and the cool thing about thermo texts far infrared heat regular heat penetrates just a few millimeters basically skin deep yeah this actually feel penetrates 60 millimeters which is two point three six inches so as you're gonna find it as we'll demonstrate today in some cases the heat will go all the way through the joint right so if you haven't troubled your wrist joint or your knee joint or your your elbow your shoulder the heat can go all the way through I've tried you know I used my thermal text every night I just have it laying in my chair and it's just my nightly little treat and if I'm having knots pain from you know pain in my back they just melt away sure I've used it compared it to a heating pad that we were sent I thought I you know try and do a little bit of contest your typical convection yeah and it's a great heating pad but it doesn't do as well it just doesn't I tell you it just you can tell it's surface right it just doesn't very superficial so let's go we're going to show it we send the platinum on oh well you know it comes with three straps so you can do a lot of different things with it and it comes with a six foot cord did we decide that's six feet yeah it's very close at least so if you're gonna use it on your neck you guys you can strap it on and so you can actually work around the house with it and it'll give you some back you know you hit the back or if you're having trouble your neck it can go up here because the thing about in far infrared heat it doesn't have to be right up against the skin it penetrates even if it's a little bit alike and you have an air gap between there unlike the convection where you really need to have that yeah you have to kind of write to write to you so if you're and the nice thing about these straps you know you can put them in different configurations you put them on it'll actually pull your shoulders back and put you in good posture which is another good benefit eliminate or you know help decrease that pain because of but yeah a lot of pains come up I'm all because you have bad posture so I'm hitting neck I can hit mid-back and you can actually strap it so it goes around your waist and you can actually hit low back to right right at the same time Brad's gonna show you some ways to hit and hit the arm in the shoulder and the hands and so like your your aunt will probably be watching this video sooner or later when she gives her she gets her thermo text so here we have the outdoors go be honest the hard pads have to you have to have the hard surface against your skin it's not like a rock hard but they're firm so you have to make sure you put on the right way so you make like we have a muff we're gonna take this I'm gonna circle it around and they got some really nice velcro it's not that the cheap velcro and you know you can just get your hands in here like this watch TV whatever it means especially having trouble with your wrists and hands which a lot of times rheumatoid arthritis that's the place that likes to settle in on does a smaller joint yeah you can then slide it up ready to elbow with the elbow and then you can undo that velcro now this looks good like if you're in a cushion in chair not so much like this more like a recliner what about which is a really nice place to relax anyways with a hot pack and then you'll trap it there I think there you go for your shoulder right you can slide it down if you got a hip problem it really works well you just kind of sit on it and if you got the armrest here that will help put the contact with the pressure on the hip and that works well I did use it on my hip I was getting some pain because of the way of sleeping at night and I actually just put it right here it was it was kind of a little bit into the groin and thigh and it worked really well I mean it just calmed it right down my wife has used it on her knee yep so you can wrap it around here get it on the knee very comfortable yeah these are built very well they are not gonna fall apart is it gonna be you're going to get years of use out of them you can't take them apart and clean them if you have a mishap with them and then you can course slide down on the ankle so we couple the ankle the knee the hip and show people actually you can just put your feet right on it and you get a little bit of for the bottom of your foot or for a little bit of arthritis again because the penetrates so deep right probably I would take your shoes off yes I would yeah so very versatile you know it's approved by the both the FDA and Health Canada they're out of Canada this is sherry that axis very inexpensive to run only costs while depending on how often you use it but all right a couple pennies a day they actually have one that's been running in their office since 2000 did we say this 2001 was it yeah I think I was 18 years and then they had a large one to one of the gold ones that was running since 1998 yeah they just let it rot because it was in their waiting area so they wanted people when they come to visit them you know they could just lay against him to get their history so yeah I did want to mention that you do have to you know plug this in to make it go for that six foot cord but this is nice if you have it around your back and you want to get up and you don't want to go over to the Ala you can easily communion I'd done that many times like I'll be working at my desk and I'll start getting some of that discomfort and I'll strap it on and then I have to go do something I'll just unplug it sure at that at that juncture and then go off and do what I want to do is so it works on you know it's real flexible in that regard right yeah we I just gotta tell story real quick we have a nursing staff around here that they come down and they're bar and our equipment all the time because they're having pain and I mentioned the fact that I could strap one of these thermit X's on her because she's having a lot of knots and she goes no no no I can't walk around with that and little later on she comes in I come through her office she's got it on strapped up she's having so much pain that she's like she decided I don't care what it looks like I'm putting it on so you know when you're in pain you'll do right these are rated to was the FDA has approved these and I said that are you said that already healthy healthcare he does even listen to you and by the way is a great discount if you go down below we want to hit the link below because you were gonna get you a lot of money off this all right very good good luck on you really did so on I did say what you're on us we're happy to help her oh yeah thanks for watching you",

        "video_title": "AC Joint Sprain Stretches & Exercises - Ask Doctor Jo",
        "video_sub_title": "Hey everybody, it's Doctor Jo and today I'm gonna show you some stretches and exercises for an AC Joint sprain. Cause it's getting hot in here! The AC doesn't actually stand for air conditioning, it stands for acromioclavicular joint. That's where the clavicle comes into the acromion in your shoulder. And a lot of times it gets sprained if you fall with an outreached arm. That actually happened to me back in college and I had a grade 2 sprain, so there's different levels of sprains. This is just to kind of get moving again so everything doesn't get scarred up in there. So the first exercise is just gonna be your set of pendulum exercises. You just want to hang the arm straight down. And the arm that you're working is gonna be completely relaxed. So you're not really moving the arm, you're moving your body so the arm moves. So it's not this movement necessarily, but it's this movement where your whole body is going into a circle. So just kind of letting it relax. Swing around. Do 10 one way, then reverse the circle and do 10 the other way. After you get those, then you can do a side to side movement. So same thing, move your whole body. It's not necessarily this movement, but it's a side to side movement this way. And then you're gonna do the front to back, so going front to back this way. Again moving that whole body making sure that, you know you can use your arm a little bit with the movement, but you really want this time it actually being momentum just swinging your arm back and forth. Cause that really loosens up that joint in the shoulder and that AC Joint right there. So the next exercises are gonna be down on the ground. So the next stretch is gonna be an active assisted range of motion for shoulder flexion. If you have a swiss ball, this works great. If you don't, you can just do this on a counter top or a table top, but I like the ball cause it gives you a little bit more motion. It gives you some stability work as well. Just place the hand on top of the arm you're gonna work, with your thumb up. Use your other hand just to kind of balance the ball a little bit cause if you haven't done it before, it's gonna want to roll all over the place. And then just roll forward with your body coming up onto your knees. So roll forward, stretch as far as you can, and then come back. You can do a little pause, maybe a 2-3 second pause wherever you want to stop if it's starting to get a little painful. Hold that stretch and come back. You don't want to push through pain, just push to the pain. Start off with just about 10 of these and then work your way up to 20 or 25. The next exercises are gonna be isometric exercises. And those are the ones where you're making the movement, but you're not actually moving, so you're gonna do external rotation and internal rotation of your shoulder. Keep your elbow as close to your side as you can, you don't want it to be out here, you want it to be nice and close to your side. Take the other hand to use it as a barrier that you're pushing in to. So I'm gonna do this motion, but I'm gonna stop myself from doing it. So just pushing inwards at a medium resistance. Don't push too hard to start off with because it might be a little tender in there. And hold it 3-5 seconds and then relax. Do 5 of those and then switch to the other side. Now this time I'm going out that way holding it there. Push out 3-5 seconds and then relax. So having that nice bend in the elbow keeping the elbow to your side. Then for the last one you're gonna actually get a resistive band. These are great. They come in different colors, different resistance. Different weights of the resistance. The yellow one is the lightest one in the theraband series, so I like to start off with that one. You're gonna keep your elbows at your side again. You're thumbs are gonna be up, and gently just pull out. Now try and keep your wrist in a neutral position. A lot of times people like to do this motion as they pull out, but you don't want to end up injuring your wrist. So try and keep those in a neutral position. Keep those elbows by your side. If you feel like you're coming out a little bit, roll up a towel and squeeze in. And then you know if the towel falls, then your elbows are coming off. So just come out as far as you comfortably can, it doesn't have to be all the way out, and then slowly come back in. Controlling that band. So don't go fast, make sure you;re getting that movement going back in nice and controlled. So again, just start off with maybe 10 of these and then if it becomes easy, do a couple sets and then work your way up to 20 - 25 repetitions. So there you have it, those were your stretches and exercise for your AC Joint Sprain. If you have any questions, leave them in the comments section. Don't forget to like us. And remember, be safe, have fun, and I hope you feel better soon.",

        "video_sub_title": "hi and welcome to be uptown the three times blog my name is dr. Dave genie and I practice in Seattle Washington you know is we save a lot of our patients we realize that a good number of them are children and many of those children have myopia in fact we know that the number of myopic individuals is doubled since the 1970s or at least the rate of myopia has doubled since the 1970s and we asked the question is there anything that we can do to actively slow down the progression of nearsightedness in these children we get asked that question by parents every single day the other evidence is pretty clear that there's a couple of things that we can do one of them is that we could potentially use a keen eye drops and there's some research being done utilizing low concentration attribute naturally slow down the progression that's not fda-approved that's not available in the market yeah but it is something we want to be looking out for what are the other exciting things that were utilizing is contact lenses for and more in fact multifocal contact lenses specifically distant center lenses have been utilized over over the years and in the literature show that could be even a 50% reduction in slowing the one that we're using more and more offices to use it worked ok ethology and wipe earth ok can do for our patients as it gives them the freedom of glasses and contact lenses all day long which parents really liked because they don't have to worry about their children using their contact lenses well there's you know that a sport or in school and having kind of solutions with them and it also gives them freedom from having to worry about glasses getting broken and lost the parent can control the environment that the child is wearing their contact lenses we've seen great success with slowing down the progression of your side of this in fact the literature shown about a 50% reduction of the progression of near sightedness so if you haven't given that a thought you haven't looked into doing this in your office I highly recommend you look into it and consider it for your practice we'd love to know what your thoughts are leave them below and thanks for joining us the optometry time vlog",

Sylvester I'm going to show patients how to do a think'll that we call nerve gliding here at the clinic it's a it's an exercise that we use for all kinds of nerve pathology a lot of people have neuropathy and we use it for patients with neuropathy and we also use it after surgery if they've had tarsal tunnel syndrome if you have tarsal tunnel syndrome we use it before surgery to try and get it to go away basically it's stretching the nerve and getting it to glide in its tunnel so I'm gonna have my my assistant here move her foot we're going to show you where this tarsal tunnel is I'll draw an or foot if it's okay I've written drawn a couple of dots the nerve comes down here like this and then it branches into three big branches and then there's a couple depending on the individual variability there's a couple of other branches as well and then this branch is quite small on the back but anyway the nerve gets there's a tunnel that this nerve gets trapped in and so I'll draw that in a little different kind of color there's a little thing up here called the flexor retinaculum and underneath this is called the tarsal tunnel and then there's some other tunnels down here that cover the nerve and the nerve kind of gets pinched there so one of the things that we do is try to get this nerve to move in this tunnel so and you can all see cuz I've drawn it you can see so you can move the foot all the way in and the nurse fairly short and then you move it all the way out and the nerve gets very long so you can see there's a lot of gliding going on inside that foot and so what happens is is that we're trying to get the nerve to loosen up and wide and thereby reach decrease the adhesions and things how we tell our patients to do it is to take the foot up and out all the way hold it for 30 seconds and then bring it and I'm not going to do it for 30 seconds then bring it down and in and hold it for 30 seconds and then repeat that about five or six times and do that maybe ten times a day up and out down and in and do that five times and then then do it about ten times a day okay there's another nerve on this leg and I type then it comes down here on the front of the leg and goes down and you can do that that nerve as well and it's basically the same exercise you're just stretching the nerves on the front of the leg and so it's down an end and then you stretch it and hold it for 30 seconds and then up and out the symptoms that can go along with this nerve pain are you know on the one it's on the top of the leg you can have numbness tingling burning electrical sensation on the top of your foot in this area on the bottom of your foot when you have that it can come as heel pain it can come as as arch pain it can come as just you know nighttime burning tingling all the symptoms that people associate with neuropathy so anyway that's a nerve exercise you can do and if you do it frequently a lot of times it can alleviate a lot of the pain that you have in your your leg we use it all the time right after surgery to keep the nerve moving so the scar doesn't heal down on the nerve thanks for listening [Music] you",

        "video_title": "Dia de los Muertos Part 1",
        "video_sub_title": "hi everybody it's Joey I'm back again with another makeup look this time for the Mexican holiday of Dia de los Muertos or the day of the dead traditional Mexican holiday where there's a parade and celebration to honor one's ancestors in hopes that they'll hear you anything near and so I'll take you step-by-step through this look and I'll show you how I achieved it alright so once again for this look my skin is clean and prepped and in addition my head has been shaved because this look as you saw will go all the way back to the back of the head as if the skull mask encompassed the entire face and head so with this look it's list like previous looks that I've done about looking human it's more about a character or a very stylized idea particularly with Dia de los Muertos with the day of the dead the masks and the make up for it is highly highly stylized and I would invite you to go online explore some look some of them are just absolutely incredible so to begin look today I'm going to working with mmm a Mac chroma cake and a clear sky blue with a stippling brush and a Croma cakes are a product that you actually use met so I dipped the stippling brush in water and just run it across the makeup and the more you run it the thicker the paste gets so if you want a light wash of color more water is better if you want opaque coverage less water do you know that these do dry down and they dry down to a really nice water resistant finish it's important to know also they are water soluble so if you do have a tendency to sweat like I do especially sweating now on my upper lip good they haven't have a tendency to separate and will take some steps to uh to alleviate that later so I'm just going to begin by buffing the product onto the skin and you can see with this particular application technique it goes really really fast and at the good thing about that is because it is a water-based product or water tivated you want to work quickly because as it dries if you go over it again it'll begin to chop kind of chunk apart almost and so on you can even see that it's a little streaky and that's okay because will buff the texture out as we go along so the same thing I'm with the head will actually just work in buffing motions all the way to the back of my skull and what you'll I'll do is I'll actually use my trusty hand mirror with the mirror that I have in order to look behind myself and actually complete the look on the back of the head this is the first time that I've ever tried anything like this so it should be an interesting experiment and so we'll come back together and see what it looks like once I had the entire head completed all right and so now you can see we have the entire head covered in turquoise there are some spots that aren't completely covered and that's okay because the next step in the process is to actually take a little bit of makeup forever flash color and number zero which is a turquoise color and I've warmed it up on the back of my hand I'm going to use my stippling brush that's been cleaned and dried off in order to sort of now lightly buff it over this product that has now dried and what it'll do is sort of fill in all those little cracks and crevices where the products didn't go on completely and totally evenly and then you can powder it all together what's great about this is it also gives you a really long wearing effect so I'll just take the stippling brush and you'll see that I'll actually take it and move the product to a bare place in my hand I don't want the brush saturated with the product I just want enough on there to sort of just lightly and sort of stipple over top of it if you white you'll actually take away the the product that you applied before so you just want to kind of like lightly bounce this over top and when you see color stop paying off just you know rii dip a little bit and put a little bit more on this is going to have kind of a textured appearance which is something that I wanted it's going to look a lot like like ceramic like one of the ceramic masks and so a little texture in the skin is totally okay because again this is kind of an homage if you will to the Mexican death masks alright and there you can see we're starting to get a beautiful smooth coat color payoff and then we'll powder it as with any look powdering is key especially if you want the make up a set and to be able to work over it and blend things over top of it without them sticking or skipping or giving you an uneven blend so again I'm going to rely on my Mac translucent invisible set powder and again I'm going to just take the actual container and lightly tap the powder out over my face so that I get a good even coverage of product and again I don't want that the sticky greasepaint to be stuck in the fibers of my brush so I'm going to use my Mac 150 powder brush as soon as I have tapped out enough powder all over the face to really set this look so again completely covered in powder and that is ok because then you can lightly sweep it and it'll settle into the places where it needs to go you'll notice I didn't bother covering my brows or even I'm putting makeup really completely around the eye area because the eyes will be blacked out there's no need to over layer a product so if it's not necessary to put it there i'm a big believer in don't the fewer layers of product that you have I mean you know your makeup will wear better your color payoff will also be more saturated because there's not layers underneath diluting the product which is a mistake that makeup artists make early on particularly with water activated ingredients so if I were to go over this with a wet black and I had really covered these areas it would pick the turquoise back up and essentially dilute the black and have to work a lot harder to get a true honest deep black all right clean perfect turquoise complexion the next step I want to go in and highlight on and give a lot of contour because this is a skull look so I'll be contouring with some deep mm shadows and turquoise and sort of an indigo color but I want to also highlight using a little bit of Mac white airbrush pigment with a little bit of yellow and a little bit of blue to give me a really fair turquoise color and so I'm just going to do that really lightly over the tops of the cheekbones to get them a strong highlight and strong definition and you can see there that it starts to cut away and become a really strong highlight I'm also going to do it on the top of the brow bone and across the forehead so you can see that that highlight beginning to to arrive and if you can't really plan out where your highlights going to go you can you know choose the contour person highlight later it there's nothing that says that you have to do them in any particular order I just find that if i highlight first my contour seems up to be a little bit more intense or more obvious so I'm going to continue to highlight with the white mixture and then we'll begin to contour the look",

        "video_title": "How to Lower Thyroid Antibodies",
        "video_sub_title": "How to Lower Thyroid Antibodies Thyroid antibodies are typically produced when you have an autoimmune disease such as Hashimoto's disease or Grave's disease. These antibodies then attack the thyroid, causing a drop in your thyroid hormone, and thus, hypothyroidism. This might seem scary, but you can work with your doctor to find a treatment that is right for you. Usually, the doctor focuses on replacing the thyroid hormone rather than lowering the antibodies in your blood. However, some treatments do work on the autoimmune part of the disease instead, lowering the antibodies. Method 1 Creating a Plan with Your Doctor 1. Talk to an endocrinologist. If you're worried about your thyroid antibody levels, make an appointment with an endocrinologist or gland specialist to discuss treatments. Explain the reasons why you are there and have a list of questions ready to ask. The doctor will help you determine the best treatment for you. However, if you want a different treatment, don't be afraid to get a second opinion. You can also start by talking to your primary care doctor. If you want to discuss special treatments, like those mentioned below, ask for a referral to an endocrinologist. 2. Try low-dose naltrexone. Naltrexone is typically used to treat opioid addiction, as it blocks opioid receptors. In that case, it is given in high doses. However, it has also been used to treat autoimmune disorders like Hashimoto's disease, so it may be able to help lower your antibodies. In this case, you take a small dose; for instance, you may start out at 1.5 milligrams per dose. As a comparison, a full dose is considered 50 milligrams. Low-dose naltrexone has little-to-no side effects. Typically, you may have trouble sleeping in the first week and more vivid dreams overall. 3. Discuss stem cell treatments. Stem cells may also be useful in treating Hashimoto's and Grave's disease. Stem cell treatment may be able to reset your autoimmune disease or just reduce the antibodies in your system. For instance, one typical treatment is harvesting stem cells from fat, which are then put back into your body. This treatment is called autologous mesenchymal stem cell transplantation, and it's still experimental. These treatments may cause a few minor short-term side effects, such as fever or headache. 4. Monitor your thyroid levels through your doctor. Your thyroid levels will need to be monitored when beginning either of these treatments, as they can work rapidly on the autoimmune disorder. In turn, it can lead to hyperthyroidism if you're still taking a large dose of the thyroid hormone. Hyperthyroidism is just as serious as hypothyroidism. Method 2 Using Natural Remedies 1. Take vitamin D. Many people with Hashimoto's disease have a vitamin D deficiency, and increasing your intake of vitamin D can lower your thyroid antibodies. It may also lower your cholesterol if it is high due to the disease. In addition, it may help keep you from developing hypothyroidism or at least slow down the process. Talk to your doctor before beginning a vitamin D regimen. You should have your vitamin D levels checked first. Plus, the typical dose tested in studies is 50,000 international units of vitamin D a week, a dosage that will need to be prescribed by your doctor. Typically, you are considered deficient if your vitamin D levels are less than 20 ng/mL. However, some doctors feel your levels should be at 50 ng/mL if you have an autoimmune disorder. 2. Try a selenium supplement. Selenium, a vitamin found primarily in Brazil nuts, has been shown to help some patients battle the autoimmune part of the Hashimoto's and Grave's disease, which means that your body may not produce as many antibodies. Because it's not commonly found in the everyday diet, you'll need to take a supplement of 83 micrograms of selenomethionine per day. This treatment only works for about 1/3 of patients. Always talk to your doctor before beginning a treatment such as this one. Selenium is a vitamin that can be toxic in high doses, so don't exceed 400 micrograms in a day, both from food and supplemental sources. 3. Use melatonin. Some evidence suggests that melatonin may be helpful with autoimmune disorders such as Hashimoto's disease, which may help your body not produce as many antibodies. This supplement is relatively safe, though long-term usage hasn't been studied much. Start with a low dose, such as 0.3 milligrams an hour before bed. You can take up to 5 milligrams, but you should discuss it with your doctor. It may take up to a month to work. 4. Consider a special diet, such as an anti-inflammatory diet. In some cases, following a special diet may help control an autoimmune disorder. Sometimes, that may mean avoiding a certain allergy, such as wheat. You can be evaluated for food allergies or sensitivities, or you can try one of the special diets recommended for autoimmune disorders. You can also aim for a more holistic diet, which could entail cutting out processed food or adding in more fruits and vegetables. For instance, you can try an anti-inflammatory diet, which means eating as much fresh fruit and vegetable as possible and more whole grains, rather than processed food. Include carbs, fat, and protein at every meal. 5. Try the FODMAP diet as an alternative. You can also try the low FODMAP diet. With this diet, you lower your intake of foods high in fructose (such as fruit juices, apples, honey, and mangoes), fructans (such as garlic, onions, nectarines, and wheat), lactose (such as milk, ice cream, and yogurt), Gos (such as chickpeas, legumes, and cashews), and polyols (such as pears, plums, mushrooms, and snow peas). 6. Use the autoimmune protocol diet as a third option. A similar diet is the autoimmune protocol diet, where you eliminate foods such as grains, sugars, legumes, alcohol, gluten, and dairy. You'll also skip eggs, nightshade vegetables (such as tomatoes, peppers, potatoes, and eggplant), nuts, and seeds and limit your fruit. Method 3 Treating Hypothyroidism in Other Ways 1. Take levothyroxine. The main treatment for hypothyroidism, even when it's caused by Hashimoto's or Grave's disease, is taking thyroid hormone replacement. Typically, you'll be on a dose of levothyroxine, a synthetic hormone that mimics your body's natural hormone. Levothyroxine has no common side effects. Less common side effects include things like urinating less often, trouble breathing, less heat tolerance, breathing issues, increased blood pressure or pulse, menstrual changes, sweating, and nausea. 2. Expect monitoring. Typically, your doctor will check your thyroid levels again after a month or so to see how you're progressing. You don't want to take too much levothyroxine, as that can lead to hyperthyroidism, which is also bad for your health. Your doctor will also monitor your levels once a year after your thyroid levels are stabilized to make sure you are still taking an effective dosage. 3. Limit your iodine intake. Iodine is necessary for your health. However, if you eat too much when you have Hashimoto's disease, it can increase your chances of developing hypothyroidism or make it worse. Seaweed is one of the main sources of high doses of iodine in your diet, so talk to your doctor before consuming it. Seaweed is often used in sushi. Also avoid iodized salt, seafood, dairy products, egg yolks, red dye #3, chocolate with milk in it, soybeans and related products, and any vitamins with iodine. Make sure to read labels and check for iodine. 4. Take levothyroxine 4 hours before or after certain other medications. Other medications and supplements can interfere with levothyroxine, including calcium supplements, some antacids (including those with calcium carbonate and those with aluminum hydroxide), iron supplements, sucralfate, and cholestyramine. To avoid interactions, try to put 4 hours between when you take levothyroxine and any of these other medications. Thank you for watching.

        "video_title": "Top 5 Lumbar Spinal Stenosis Exercises & Stretches - Ask Doctor Jo",
        "video_sub_title": "hey everybody it's Doctor Jo and Lion Kali, and today I'm going to show you my top 5 ways to relieve lumbar stenosis. so let's get started. so the first thing we're gonna do is a simple knee to chest stretch. so just go ahead and lie down on your back. I like propping my knees up. that just takes some pressure off of your back and especially if you have that lumbar stenosis. you want to bring up bring them up, just to relax that back a little bit. you don't have to, sometimes people like to keep one leg down and bring the other one up, but I like to keep them bent. another big thing is sometimes people grab up here for that knee to chest. if you have any knee issues, you might want to grab underneath. I just prefer that because that's sometimes putting a lot of pressure on your knee joint. so if you don't have any problems with your knees that's fine, but I like to grab underneath. once you grab underneath, just bring that knee up towards your chest as far as you comfortably can. sometimes people have a little pain in the groin area, so if you have some pain while doing that, just don't pull up quite as hard. just go to comfort level. you should feel a nice gentle stretch in your low back with this and this just kind of helps open up those spaces and takes the pressure off of those nerves coming out of the canals of the spine. so you want to hold this for about 30 seconds, and I would definitely do both sides so switching is the best for me. if you want to do them all on one side and then switch, you can, but I like alternating back and forth so one has a little bit of a break. so 30 seconds, three times on each side. so the next one is going to be a glute stretch. a lot of times with that lumbar stenosis, if you have tight gluts that puts a lot of pressure on the spine and again if there's pressure there that makes those little canals were the openings with those nerves going through smaller, and then it presses on those nerves, and that's what causes a lot of the pain. so a simple glute stretch, the easiest one is probably just doing the figure four stretch. if you have a hard time doing it this way, you can do it seated in a chair, but the side that you want to stretch you're going to cross it over. or the other just the top of the knee right there. and so it looks like a figure four. if you're looking down that's why it's called a figure four stretch. so you can do this a couple different ways. you want to really try and keep your back straight if you can. some people kind of curl up like this, but if you're curling your back, you're not really getting a stretch, and if you have to notice this even though the the bending sometimes gives it relief you don't want to do an extreme bending motion. so you can either keep your back straight and lean forward like that to get a stretch, and I'm feeling a nice stretch right through there. or you can stay in one spot keeping that back straight and then slide your heel up this way, and that will give you a big stretch as well. so this is another one where it's thirty Seconds. I would do them on each side just like we talked about. so switching in between and doing thirty seconds on each side. so either again you can lean forward with your back straight or you can slide that heel up to get that stretch, and again that stretch should be comfortable it shouldn't be painful. just some tension and some pressure on it. so then the next one's going to be kind of a combination move. we're just gonna start off with a pelvic tilt, but we're gonna take it all the way into a dead bug exercise. but the the pelvic tilt is how you start. so you really want to master the pelvic tilt first. and all that is is basically it's like it sounds. you want to take your pelvis and tilt it. so when I'm doing a pelvic tilt, this little curve in my back I want to flatten it out towards the floor, or the bed, or the couch. you don't have to get down on the floor. if you're having a lot of pain, it's hard to get up off the floor, you can do this on your bed or on the couch, but the firmer the better. when you're doing that pelvic tilt, you want to use your core and your pelvic muscles to do this. you don't want to use your legs. so if you're kind of bringing your bottom up like this, I'm pushing with my gluts and my hamstrings, that's not what you want. to help with that lumbar stenosis is to help the strengthening of the core, you want to use your core muscles to flatten it out. a lot of times I'll tell my patients it's like you're fake laughing. like have you gone your your core tightens up and that's what you want. you want it you want to feel those muscles contracting. so just holding it for about three to five seconds, and then relaxing. once you have that pelvic tilt down and you feel like you're doing a good job not using your legs anymore, then you're going to go into the dead bug. and the reason that you don't want to use your legs to hold that tilt is because now you're gonna add some components and while you're holding that tilt. so I'm going to get myself in that pelvic tilt, and then I'm gonna take one leg and just lift it up a little bit off the ground. I don't have to bring it all the way up, I'm just trying to keep that tilt the whole time. I'm lifting the leg and then when I lift the leg I'm gonna take my opposite arm and bring it up. so I'm going up like this, and then coming back down. so again I'm not pulling my knee all the way up to my chest, I'm just kind of lifting it up, but I'm trying to keep that tilt the whole time. and if you do it right it's a lot harder than it it's like I can do you know this, but I'm not holding that tilt. so it's really all about holding that tilt and going slow. and then so just gently lifting up lifting the arm up, getting that cross pattern in your body, and then slowly coming back down and building up that core strength is really going to help with that lumbar stenosis. so that since this is kind of a combination move, it's a little hard to get figured out. I just do maybe three lifts on each side and then take a break. if you have to stop in between and reset the tilt, that's fine. so if I just did one and then come back down, I can stop and reset that tilt, but if if you can hold it the whole time, that's even better. so then the next exercise is going to be going all the way up into a bridge. so again where now we're going to be strengthening the glutes and the hamstrings. so we're still doing some strengthening. with bridging you really want to now use those glutes to hamstrings and kind of drive your knees forward as you're lifting up. you want to go one segment of at a time of your back. you don't have to stop at each segment, but you don't want to just come up and down like this. you don't want to just use your momentum of your body to do it. you really want to come up one segment at a time, drive those knees forward, and then nice and slowly coming back down. so with the bridging, as long as it feels good, you just want to come to about level. you don't want to try and arch your back up. and then as long as it's not painful, you can just start off with maybe ten, two sets of ten, a couple times a day. so the last one that's going to be getting up and we're going to get onto all fours or in quadrupeds. so once you get into this position, again if you can't get on the floor, you can do these on your bed. it might be a little squishy, so that might actually make you work a little bit harder because it'll be unstable, but you can definitely do these in the bed. so when you're in this quadrupeds position, or on for all fours, you want to try and keep your back again kind of straight. tighten up that core. so you're not sagging down like this, you're not arching up, you know that's a pretty straight line. it might not be exact, but you really want to keep that core nice and tight the whole time. so in this position, you're gonna do what we call a bird dog. and so a bird dog is basically you're lifting one arm and kicking out the opposite leg. so it's kind of like the dead bug, but now you're having to do a little more stability of your whole body. so if you want to just start with lifting out your arms, straightening them out, you can do that. just to kind of practice a little bit. you can also then just kick your leg out, but the goal especially when you're doing the leg kick is not to lean over and kick like that. you want your back to stay flat that whole time. like if I had a glass of water on my back, I'm trying not to make that glass of water fall. so once you have those two pretty much mastered, then you put it together where you're putting one arm out and the opposite leg out. and really just nice try and control it. again imagine that you have that Cup on your back and if you're going fast, you're probably going to spill it. so since this one's a little bit tougher, you definitely want to just start off with maybe two on each side. see how you feel, and then do that a couple times a day. and you can progress from there. so those are my top five ways to relieve lumbar stenosis. if you'd like to help support my channel, make sure and click on the link up there. and don't forget to subscribe by clicking, we're?, down there. and remember be safe, have fun, and I hope you feel better soon.",
